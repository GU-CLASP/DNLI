A	so I really lively said why don't just say hello just say morning?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	right
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	you would've been like mum come on leave us alone but
C	mm
A	like she's twenty-three this year
C	mm
A	and I thought I didn't I thought she was twenty-two this year
C	oh yeah when you told me that even
A	yeah
C	Cos she acts like an eighteen year-old
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	no
C	that is really badly behaved
A	yes really
C	I'm surprised you know obviously it was always gonna be quite hard for her mum to ask her to leave and she obviously hasn't done that
A	no
A	um and she was like oh so I can earn a bit more money cos I'm absolutely skint all the time
C	yeah
A	she earns about a
C	oh right and she lives at home yeah
A	I was like seriously? And she was like yeah I know I said tell me about it she said no really
A	she was like well you know a bit a little bit more than me and I was like yeah a hundred pound she was like well there you go then
C	yeah absolutely
A	she was like well no but it's two hundred
A	so she yeah she's she's comparing two hundred pounds to my five hundred
C	yeah but still
A	I was just like what? And I was like
C	I can't believe she charges you twenty quid a week more than she charges me
A	yeah
C	for a room
A	yeah
C	only just bigger than mine
A	yeah
C	she just
A	no
C	Cos she doesn't need to
A	 Yeah so that so that means there's not that much difference between us and I was like yeah um and pay for food
C	yeah
A	 and I pay for transport and I pay the car insurance
C	yeah
A	D'you know what I mean?
C	absolutely
A	and she just wasn't getting it
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	she's a nice girl but it must be difficult to be friends with someone like that because you are so different
A	it's just craziness
C	mm
A	I expected her to maybe appreciate that having her mum like that
C	yeah she's lucky to have that
A	yeah
C	to be able to to say yeah to not take her for granted and to appreciate what she's got
A	yeah
C	well that's the thing cos you would think that having spoken to you know once or twice about your family situation the thought would've occurred actually d'you know I haven't had half as much drama with my family as I've as
A	yeah
C	they um they just see it see their problems they don't see other people's problems
A	very very strange
C	okay and I will get the thing for the gravy
A	yeah
C	so family?
A	yeah
A	played there
C	mm
A	um he said but some time it might be a generation thing cos my dad doesn't you know show emotion at all really
C	yeah
A	and I said and it's different cos you know you were really seriously hurt
C	mm
A	um and your dad's
C	was he?
A	yeah
C	ah
A	yeah
C	yeah that's the thing you know he's he's an independent business man like it must be difficult to sort of juggle the two
A	yeah
C	I'm not making excuses you know he might well be a twat but
A	yeah
A	ah I had broccoli for lunch like the other day just broccoli just broccoli on its own
C	ah yum
A	mm
C	like the best thing ever
A	and gravy
C	you're telling me
A	yeah and he said um he said oh yeah I can kind of you know I can kind of understand that apologies for a bit of bra showing but I'm a bit hot now
C	mm
A	round here and the first thing he did was start bartering for a an argument and I was like really? you know your your well your son's pretty sick
C	yeah
A	 What d'you know what did he say? And he said oh well he came and said you know your you know right
C	yeah
A	and then he was like um and you been drinking? And
A	and then he just started off going off on one
C	yeah
A	from drinking
C	D'you think any parent is gonna say well done mate ?
A	yeah
C	and if he had what kind of a parent would he be?
A	yeah
C	yeah what you doing?
A	to which he would reply Shut your face I'm an adult I get it it's embarrassing enough as it is
C	yeah
A	 Thanks like but
C	but it they wouldn't be a parent if they didn't worry
A	no they wouldn't be a parent if they didn't say that
C	my mum would go you know any parent would you know any normal parent would go pretty mental at the sight of you if they thought that because of drinking you could
A	that's what you'd done
C	but you'd also you could it could've been far worse if if it was a car which we don't know
A	yeah
C	you could've gone under the wheels of a car just for larking around
A	could be dead
C	D'you what I mean I it's parents usually get annoyed because they're scared
A	yeah
C	and they get annoyed with you when you do stupid things because they're scared that something serious is gonna happen to you
A	yeah
C	you'd think moving out you'd get more of an appreciation for what your parents do for you
A	ahh should I start carving d'you think?
C	ooh yum
A	huh
C	is this enough broccoli for you? D'you want me to
A	uh I don't mind that's fine for me

A	yeah
C	to break their spirits?
A	yep
C	does this not make you worry? I mean I know you're not going in the Marines but still
A	yes
A	yeah

A	 and I finish at four
C	ah
A	whatever
C	uh in the bin
C	to be fair you would just eat food out the bin wouldn't you cos you'd be starving?
A	yeah
C	I don't think so
A	they came out the water and they were so cold that they had a medical officer had to check every single one individually
C	to make sure they weren't dead?
A	make sure they weren't dying yeah
C	Jesus
A	sweet
C	ah thank you mate
A	just take this as well
C	no I don't like that bit
A	oh I like that better than the other bit
C	I don't like the stalky bit
A	yeah
C	that's funny
A	oh thanks mate
C	one chicken down
A	got it
C	apparently it means someone
A	she even gives him his food
C	oh does she?
A	yeah
C	that's very cute
A	can't understand the words
C	oh
A	Don't know what Papa is
C	I think it's Babbino
A	did you say sweet?
C	yeah My Sweet Papa
C	R O mm
A	thought it was carino
A	this is this is what terrifies me here
C	running in the rain?
A	no
C	live fire?
A	yeah
C	they wouldn't do that to you would they?
A	I fucking hope not
C	the army do it I've seen films where the
A	what?
C	in the
A	yeah
C	through the course
C	she's gotta use some special steps?
A	mm
C	hilarious
A	it's like a box thing
C	oh god
C	how are they? Where's the live fire?
A	now
A	I hope not
C	I mean it seems incredibly dangerous
A	doesn't it?
A	they've been firing a shot right next to her head
A	God I just
A	I fucking hope not look at all those flame throwers and mines and
C	I mean would they not tell you? I mean that's what you need to ask really
A	yeah I think I need to ask this
C	mhm
C	oh and strobe lighting oh my god you just wanna be sick
A	ahh yeah I remember what happens now
A	I bet that's the thing she's supposed to use
C	oh
A	like a box with steps on it
A	cos all the men like to just climb
A	yeah
C	and how did the rest of them get up?
A	I know what happens
C	Cos they like trod on her head
A	so she was like helping up all the massive heavy men
C	jumped on her back yeah
A	yeah
C	and then how how does she get over? They just leave her?
A	no well the
C	yeah
A	so technically if she wasn't a woman and had that box that'd be her gone now she'd'a failed the course because of that
C	Jesus
A	yeah but nobody knows that they're viewing it
C	mm
A	like like that guy who was the Gun Master Chief person that just saw it through his gun rifle
C	Ohh
A	but he only knows cos he was trying to shoot her
C	nice
C	aww
A	still on the base
C	what are they squirting them with? Is it whipped cream? Open wide
C	he's gotta do the course again
A	he's gonna quit
A	three rings and you quit
C	and he's got blood coming out of his head
A	yeah but she doesn't understand cos she was the last one
C	yeah
A	and
C	mm
A	has failed it
C	mm
A	uh no
C	mm
A	so no one else knows what he's talking about but they guy's giving it him because he left her behind and he knows it
C	mm
A	yes
C	I think that sounds a little bit like double standards but it's fine
A	I don't think they would've actually killed her
A	yeah
C	not getting emotional here
A	they just are all the way through they're like they're purposely trying to make them fail all the time
C	mm
C	kick it
A	spit at it
A	like the women have to do less press-ups and stuff don't they than men? He's saying she's a woman she gets thirty seconds free
C	ahhh
A	she's like fuck off I don't want thirty seconds free
C	it'd be so hard not um take it though wouldn't it?
A	 yeah
C	mm
A	I don't know
C	I don't know if
A	like think of like Miss World Wrestler people
C	mm yeah but I think genetically apart from various freaks don't think women are supposed to be
A	if they can do it d'you think women can do it?
C	hmm
A	Cos she now to be one of these people would not need to as physically fit
C	mm
A	as the Miss World
C	mm
A	I dunno
C	mm
A	well you can't see from where you're sat but I took my nail polish off the other day
C	mm
A	and left nail polish remover round the pad on there and it's burnt it all burnt
C	Ohh
A	yeah
C	oh my god
A	like it's all gone
C	that's pretty corrosive
A	bubbly
C	Jesus
A	it's gone down to
C	Jesus
A	you're a
C	mm hmm hmm
C	mm hmm
A	that's not the man that you were trying to tell me about is it?
C	Andrew Lincoln no he's just one of the characters
A	oh okay
C	sorry
C	oh he was in Love Actually
A	oh yes that's not who I was thinking of
C	oh
A	at all
C	I think that is from Love Actually actually that picture
A	that's not who I was thinking of at all
C	ah I see now
A	Clutterbuck
C	that's a much better name than Lincoln
A	I'd rather be called Clutterbuck
C	I like it
A	huhh
A	certainly not who I was thinking of
C	no but he's pretty cute
A	he is pretty hot
C	mm is this where she shaves her head? Pretty fortunate for you Demi you've got a nice shaped head
A	yeah
C	no it's like Hilary Swank she's a a really ugly woman isn't she?
A	which one's she?
C	oh gawd I dunno why I
A	is she in?
C	boys Don't Cry
A	ah
A	I've got a new one
C	oh I don't know

A	eucch
A	I've got Chelsea to bring the razor with her when she comes
C	mm
A	so it's gone
A	I'd like to go on a quick like walk somewhere cos I really want to put the apple pies in my mouth
C	I know
[ANNOTATION]	A is going to have her head shaved	Neutral
A	badly
C	really really badly
C	what's occurring?
A	D'you it's really hard to see when these when it's light out here
C	yeah
A	it's really Mister Fickle isn't it? They're taking the piss basically cos she's walked in
C	mm
A	and they've taken tampons out of her bag
C	Cos they're totally nice
[ANNOTATION]	A told Chelsea not to bring the razors with her	Contradiction
A	yep
C	mm
C	uh model has natural twenty inch waist
A	no
C	rank as hell
A	what?
C	oh my god you have to see this photo
A	have you got the photograph of the twenty inch waist?
C	she says it is natural she
C	she says that's natural
A	no
C	modelling agencies are in big trouble now aren't they if they um hire size zero models
[ANNOTATION]	It's natural and normal to have a twenty inch waste as an adult woman	Contradiction
A	okay
C	I mean looks skinny but looks okay
A	I can't believe that's a real person
[ANNOTATION]	Hilary Swank was in boys Don't cry	Entailment
C	mm something's gone wrong there
A	I mean the dress accentuates it doesn't it the dress she's wearing makes you see it worse cos it makes her top and her bottom look bigger because of the frills
C	mm
A	I think she's had one of those trainers on you know? Like Dita Von Teese?
C	oh maybe yeah
A	those things that you wear all tend to overuse it makes you shaped like that doesn't it?
C	but look at her legs
[ANNOTATION]	A has a personal trainer	Neutral
A	massive gap you could fit your fist in between them
C	ah it's not normal
A	is there any other pictures of her apart from that red dress?
C	see her hips are thirty-two inches
C	she weighs eighty-four pounds
C	half of me
A	oh it's
C	mm
C	which is what's that divided by fourteen?
A	I don't know
C	divide by ten is is eight so it's it's less than eight stone seven stone
A	so unfair
A	holy Yackerbuckackers
C	what is her name I can't remember
A	that's normal
A	that's not normal
C	it's not normal at all is it?
A	no
C	Ioana Spangenberg
B	hiya
C	ridiculous voice
A	fuck
C	nobody talks like that
A	no we should've put a Spanish film on
A	is there more?
C	yeah I've Googled them now
A	ahh I want to see
C	oh she went into a cat suit here
A	mm
C	mm
A	eugh look at
A	she doesn't look as well she she's wearing something disgusting but she doesn't look as crazy there
C	no
A	yeah
C	but the but the waist definitely is so much skinnier than the hips
A	yeah
A	oh shit
C	what the? What is the doing? Pull-ups? Oh my god
A	holy shit
C	huh?
A	she's had a waist trainer on
C	oh fucking hell
A	I think so yeah
C	mm
A	um cos they wear all fifties clothing
C	right
A	and I mean that's by the far the most extreme version
C	mm
A	are they putting her in the catwalk then?
C	yeah
A	are they?
C	yeah
A	shit
C	ooh
A	thought that was a spider but there isn't it's hanging off my sock
C	mm
C	hm
C	that's
A	and she looks like a man now
C	yeah
C	ooh I'm getting close to pie time
A	yeah I'm getting close to pie time
A	I'm quite inclined to put a
C	yeah
A	mm
C	hmm?
A	thought I forgot how much
A	aww
C	it's the best one
A	yeah
C	and you'll be in the Navy
A	yeah
C	ooh that'd be nice
C	mm
C	oh I've got my mum's version of Talk To Her
A	ah we could do that then
C	we could watch that or we could try
A	yeah
C	what are they doing? She's gotta pull herself in the boat?
A	yeah
C	umm
A	and that stupid knob every time makes some type of bad comment about her
A	but then they all blame it on her cos they're like oh you were the dead weight
C	aww
A	Cos the whole point is that we should be a team
C	yeah
C	have they got um inflatable neck braces on or something?
A	yeah
A	world War Two
C	disgusting isn't it? I mean they had segregation in the in America until nineteen sixty-eight
A	yeah that doesn't make sense to me at all
C	mm
A	that's so late
C	it's not very it's very it's very recent
A	it's so late
C	yeah
A	like in my head when I saw the pictures of this happening
C	what the Civil Rights Movement?
A	which to me
C	mm
A	but that's that's what I think of segregation people on different buses that's when it happened
C	mm
A	yeah
C	I mean Rosa Parks who was the what they say is the start of the Civil Rights Movement when she refused to give up her seat to a white person like she was um a sixty year-old black woman travelling home on the bus from work
A	yeah
C	and she refused to give up her seat to a white person
A	that's crazy
C	well no
A	like
C	mm
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	no
C	it's not equal anywhere really
A	that's her husband
C	hmm
A	and he's giving them information about her
C	he's such a massive knob
A	yeah you think he's being a knob but but he's actually doing it because then any information about her that's being made available to the Navy he knows about
C	right
A	so you hate him now
A	I'm sure he said um
C	aww
A	can't believe this and look it's got this cotton wool stuck to it now
A	no it's there
C	no I don't want that
A	you do
C	why's it pink? Was that the colour of the nail varnish
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	that's not gone well
A	oh I've got it off
C	God you forget how corrosive that stuff is
A	well it's just it was just a nail polish remover that smelt like bubblegum
C	yes
A	and just like leant over and put it on there in the morning this had happened
C	yeah
A	empty
C	lovely
A	yeah till now
C	but obviously obviously it's pretty bad
A	well it's kind of seeped into the plastic now
C	mm
A	yeah
A	sick
C	I think it's definitely pie time now
A	aww
C	 it's so pretty
A	it's a really nice
C	at
A	aww
C	hawthorn
C	and that one
A	well it sounds like you had a really nice day
C	it's what I wanted for Easter
A	where it is
C	it is ten pounds though which is a bit excessive
A	well they didn't have it for very long cos I secretly went to try and get you one and they didn't have anywhere
C	awww that's very sweet
A	Ohh
C	mm I'll just save it for later
A	yeah
C	D'you think it is pie time?
A	maybe
C	High time we had pie time
A	but
C	no I'll come and give you and hand
A	does it like?
C	gonna make you quite upset
C	well stuff like that's really bad for you anyway
A	yeah that's true
C	you're better off doing what you're doing
A	oh god
C	oh god
A	forgot all about Monday
C	I've forgotten about Mondays
A	it's so unfair
C	I didn't recognize recognize my alarm when it went off on Tuesday morning though
C	didn't know what was going on
A	ahh
C	should I try and find Talk To Her?
A	yeah
C	okay
A	think we can enjoy the weekend a little bit more with some pie and
C	oh yeah
A	washing and all that type of stuff
C	and we have Talk To Her which is the one that didn't work from my boxset
A	yeah
C	the next film after those ones was Volver which came out a few years ago
A	ah I love that film
C	and the more
A	ah
C	who apparently is
A	as what?
C	it's um Almodvar's muse like his inspiration
A	Ohh
C	kind of thing
A	well I'll watch any
C	all of those
A	okay
A	the others
C	yeah
A	yeah they were bargainous
C	hope we don't get addicted
A	yes
C	like they throw you to other good stuff
A	in our defence had we realized how good that was we would've more bought
C	we would've bought twelve
A	yeah
C	we bought shares in the company
C	yeah
A	cabbage in everything from now on
C	it was pretty tasty even though you know we cooked it to within an inch of its life
A	yes
A	supposed to be that mushy
C	we just got just got a bit carried away with the chicken
C	you know?
A	got a bit distracted by the goodness of the chicken
C	mm
A	we never do when there's chicken involved
C	when it's smelling that good
A	oh maybe I don't want any of this water
A	mm
C	um soon
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	mm
C	is it alive?
A	yeah you need to all get out of there
C	hmm
A	I uh my theory with the putting the
C	that's fine
A	then if it doesn't I've gotta fish it out
C	well I think if it were your house you might be more worried about these things but as it's Trude's
C	couldn't give too hoots
C	petrol
C	just to see what would happen
C	yeah
C	there's no saving this house
A	no
C	that little drip tray under there
C	I think you know we're taking our life in our hands every time we come through the front door
C	yeah
A	anything health and safety please leave at the door
C	I'm wondering if she's the kind of landlord to be
A	yeah probably right
C	Cos she can fuck right off if she thinks she's keeping any of our deposit
A	yeah she can fuck right off
C	yeah
A	and that I have not done that
C	she well that's the thing when I moved in she'd only cleaned around the bed so there's loads of dirt where the bed
C	Cos they didn't because that stupid filthy girl didn't move out on time
A	yeah
A	anything serious
C	mm
A	yeah
C	so that'd be nice three hundred pounds back in the kitty
A	yep
C	I dunno it's
A	well that's
C	with my MA I applied I think in the December or the January when I first found out found about out about it but this course you could only apply from today

A	D'you see? D'you know what I mean?
C	I can that yeah yeah absolutely but I suppose you can appreciate whether you like that something's good and you can like it but yeah obviously everyone's cultures are gonna be different
A	mm like the way he sings the manner in which he sings
C	Cos there's like the way that they play guitar is known as Spanish guitar isn't it?
A	yeah
C	the way that they pluck at the strings rather than strum like it's a very Spanish way of playing
A	I suppose it's like the fashion is what I mean more like
C	mm
A	it's not fashionable in England to sing that way
C	yeah you wouldn't have someone in the charts singing like that
A	yeah
C	but I think people
A	in their charts they do
C	they do yeah
A	for what?
C	there's a big um there's a lot of uh interest in world music here
A	yeah
C	people really like it
A	yeah
C	and of course you've got like Eurotrash stuff as well haven't you which is pretty bad
C	bet you do
A	yeah I do yeah
C	that's why you're not in charge us of the music
A	ever
A	I openly admit it
A	I think when Hilary Duff came up on my uh
C	ah man alive
A	iPod was a tell-tale sign
C	who was that? Hannah Montana?
A	kind of but before her
C	mm
A	she was Lizzy McGuire
C	Lizzy McGuire yeah
A	yeah
C	see where are they now cos she's supposed to be in a coma?
C	huhh
C	hm
A	can you run in a coma?
C	I've no idea
C	so you can have no eyes when you're in a coma?
A	yeah
C	Jesus Christ
A	you wouldn't know
C	so he was waking up? But he wasn't really?
A	he was awake
C	hmm?
A	he didn't sleep for three weeks
C	he didn't sleep?
A	he wouldn't sleep
C	so they call that a coma?
A	it's a waking coma so
C	Ohh
A	he was talking to people wandering round and interacting
C	is asleep
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	who's the Prime Minister and all that shite and because he wasn't sleeping I think that's one of the things if you don't if you're not sleeping then they know that your body is basically although you're moving
C	mm
A	your body on the inside is trying to sleep
C	oh my gawd
A	yeah
C	ohhhh bless
A	of
C	ahh right
A	so on the way home
A	I'd get Mars bars and Kentucky Fried Chicken popcorn balls and sneak them in before my mum got there
C	right
A	cos I knew he'd eat it
C	mm
A	he was like no no no
A	 Want some chicken?
C	awww
A	and he used to reply like that no no no we won't tell her
C	aww
A	and then she'd come in
A	and then
A	I said what? He was singing down the down the thing Kentucky Fried Chicken
A	 Alabama Chicken Chicken Pie
A	just stupid shit
C	oh bless
A	yeah
A	it's called
A	ah
C	bellyyy
A	oh it's making noise
A	agua
A	he didn't say
A	oww
A	yeah it's alright I think it's just meat pains
C	definitely meat pains
A	no
C	as we
A	and this one
C	oh no I'm alright actually
C	hmm hmm hm
A	I like to feed this one
C	do you?
C	huh
A	Don't know
A	that doesn't really look like the woman that's
C	no this is a different woman
A	yeah
C	that was her
A	oh so it wasn't the same woman
C	there's two
A	ohhh
C	so when he was on the balcony just now he was on the balcony of the girl he loves the bullfighter's room
A	yeah
C	and then this I imagine she had an accident when she was dancing
A	yeah
C	yeah I think so
A	probs
C	I know he's some sort of
A	well
C	yeah he was in the in the because that was when he saw the bullfighter that was when they met in the
A	ohhh
C	he was there
A	mistress Whatsherface
C	yeah
A	yeah that's her name
C	that's definitely her name
A	I think it must've been
C	going into her va-jay-jay
A	yeah but even I thought that's what in hindsight that's what it must've meant
A	when the black and white thing finished
C	mm?
A	he was fully clothed massaging her
C	and that was when her dad came in? Well that was earlier
A	her dad didn't come in
C	hmm
A	like it's not like when the black and white thing finished he was naked
C	huhh
A	yeah
C	presumably
A	yeah
C	no he never actually said I raped her
A	yeah
C	but presumably he did
A	yes
C	all the food
A	the food coma
C	I uh I had to rest my eyes for a little bit there I couldn't keep them open
C	oh I know
A	but I don't seem to be moving
C	D'you know what that means?
A	what?
C	I have to make bloody soup
A	oh no
C	I don't even know what I've got to make soup with
A	that's fun
C	that's that's my favourite
A	I don't wanna make soup
C	living on a budget
A	gonna cook it
A	I do need all the soupy soupy goodness
A	anything that I eat that's got just vegetables or just fruit counts as zero
C	right
A	so the soup's only got chopped tomatoes and onion in
C	right
A	so that counts as zero
C	more like five it's
A	and
C	it's nought but okay
A	the apple
C	but if you were doing Weight Watchers that would count
A	uh yes
C	doesn't it count?
A	I can't remember if it's Weight Watchers or the other one where all you can eat as much fruit and veg as you like
A	in real life it has got
C	my pretty face
A	what?
C	right
A	I
C	thing is with these Spanish films they make my brain ache
A	how many calories is in a tin of chopped tomatoes? Cos my tin of chopped tomatoes lasts me a week
C	three
A	but three whole calories
C	yours has got chilli in them though hasn't it?
A	no I've last one did but that that wasn't the way forward
C	that was when you blew your head off
A	I
A	that was when I was
A	and then had chilli chilli con carne for tea
A	I'd actually
C	um sounds very therapeutic actually
A	yes
C	people would pay good money for that you know?
A	and not not just fucked up
A	people like when you come in it'll be like everybody in the room here's a chilli diet
C	Ohh if not you're onto a ground breaking new plan
C	where you just sweat out all the calories
C	and remove a layer of skin from your face
A	just burn it off
C	Ohh
A	burning calories in a whole new dimension
C	oh yeah
A	awww
C	we'll do it really quickly
A	awww
C	you just threw everything in?
A	all together
C	it's just you're like the best cooker in the world
C	you're so good
A	yeah
C	you don't even need to cook it
A	yeah
C	it's just magic
A	it's just magic
C	wowww
A	it's yeah it just
A	I
C	you're just unreal
A	yeah loads of garlic
C	loads of garlic
A	I did however forget tomato puree but I think uh I don't think I'm really gonna notice
C	oh
A	oh no
C	something died? Yeah don't show me
C	by magic
A	it was in the bad and I didn't know it was in the bag and I just
C	you're such a numpty Gromit
A	aww
C	how do these things happen to you hey?
A	I don't know I mean people do say to keep nail polish in the fridge to stop it from going off
C	going off
A	I don't think you're supposed to leave it right at the back where it freezes
C	probs not
A	no
C	Cos that's when it gets a bit unhappy
A	oh crap
C	yeah
C	D'you know what you haven't made in a while? Now that I've got the lentils out? Daal
A	correctomundo
C	maybe you uh overdid it a bit with the daal
A	D'you have to close that again? No I do I do quite like the daal but um I didn't want to put lentils in because then it'll add more calories to it
C	mm
A	and work seems to be the only place where I can control what I eat
A	otherwise I just eat everything in the fridge
C	yeah
A	I thought you meant my soup
A	it's perfectly cooked why wouldn't it smell lovely?
C	have you even put the heat under it?
A	um
C	it's it's winning
C	this is how
C	think you're on your own there my friend
A	think we're meant to put some thickener in hey? How many calories are in you? Ah well I'm just gonna put a tablespoon of this in
C	did you put oil in?
A	no
C	right
A	none of that
C	none of that hanging around for frying
A	no
A	rather redundant
C	took a step back
A	yeah
C	surveyed the masterpiece
A	yeah
A	I mean nobody knows how it's gonna go of course
C	think we might do
A	well I don't know cos if I can eat this one this'll be a hat trick
A	three edible soups in a row
C	no
A	if that's not tempting fate I don't know what is
C	 ahhhh
C	heaven's
A	fire in the hull
C	mm
A	there you go
C	yeah
A	fine
C	that's like that coconut juice that we saw in Stowbridge bits of death floating in it
A	yess
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c mentions a fruit	Entailment
C	well at least you're the only one eating it
A	that's true
C	so
A	at least I'm not trying to force it upon anybody else
C	to be fair it is only vegetables
A	uhh
C	famous last words and all that
A	yes
C	like I tried to put baby sweetcorn in the soup and it went mental
A	yes
C	yeah
A	I had baby sweetcorns and mange tout
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c was making a tomato soup	Neutral
A	it tasted like the Earth yes I do yeah nice
C	so note to self don't do that
C	Cos I like those
A	that's my favourite type of mushrooms
C	only if they're rotten
A	only if they're rotten
[ANNOTATION]	they are chefs	Neutral
C	exactomundo
A	think that's all the things I can chuck in
C	it's all you need
A	yeah
C	feeling pretty confident for your soup?
A	yeah
C	alll clever
A	it's all goodness
C	mm you
A	I see no problem at all
A	anti-ageing
[ANNOTATION]	they are in a cooking competition	Neutral
C	I think
A	apart from that I didn't put oil in it now maybe I should have to break some of my bad fats down
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a used way too much oil	Contradiction
A	in fact I can put this one can't I that's for dressings cos I'm not cooking with it it's just going in the soup
C	I think you're right mate I mean I didn't understand that because it does taste weird if you cook with it
A	does it?
C	yeah
A	ah
C	A lot of people usually put it on dressing as a dressing
A	D'you think I can taste it in my soup?
C	you'll be able to taste it yeah
[ANNOTATION]	dressing oil tastes nice when cooked	Contradiction
A	think I quite like it though
C	that's alright then
A	Don't know
C	I mean it's good for you it is it is olive oil so it's a good fat
C	weevils
A	weevils? Any weevils?
C	mm sadly no
A	must try harder
C	need some protein
A	must try harder to grow the weevils because of the
C	onions
C	the wrinkles?
A	yeah
C	I don't believe you've got wrinkles
A	yeah
C	noo
A	permanent as well
C	I can't see any
A	on my head
C	it is all in your head
A	no I've seen them no there's loads of them I just need botox to stop them
C	naa
A	when you relax your face any wrinkles you can see are permanent
C	when you relax your face okay
A	I can see loads
C	it's usually best not to look at them
A	it's the head ones that are worse I don't mind the eye ones so much it's the head ones
C	show
A	I know but they'll get worse
C	mm just means that you've had a lifetime of laughter or something like that
A	what I need to do is inject them so that
C	inject them
A	they don't get worse
C	with acid
A	with acid
C	yeah
A	yes
C	sensible
A	yeah I think I need to inject them with acid
C	we're all mad
A	what?
C	wine
A	end of wine
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	wine
A	all the wine in the world ever
C	all of it
A	I don't know why there's empty bottles of wine in here
C	what? That's just that's just taking the piss
A	I know
C	ahhh
A	I know
C	there's something wrong in the head with them
A	I have an empty bottle in the back of my room that's good cos I can't remember the name of some of the wines
C	of what of wines?
A	yes and I wanted that one again
C	ah

A	favourite
C	ah is it really that bad?
A	yeah it's gurgling
C	ah shit man
A	like holy fuckers what have you been eating that's what he's saying to me
C	all the food
A	well
C	yeah
A	you'd think
C	and now you'd think it'd be very happy with you
A	yeah
C	none of the actual food
A	I'm afraid not
C	alright here we go
C	right
A	not like it's about to explode at all
C	nooo
A	so what's the difference between what's in a passata and what's in

A	which I feel is the only way that anyone can live
C	yeah
A	eating all the pies

C	so yeah
A	mm mm
C	big scary meeting is fast approaching
A	scary meeting?
C	yeah the one that I have to chair
A	oh no
C	yeah
A	that does not sound like fun
C	it's not a fun time
A	yeah
C	I think in actual fact it'll be harder reining them in than it would be to get them to talk
C	just sit there
A	okay
C	where the puddles go
C	that's just fine
A	that's just where the puddle lives
C	yeah
A	that's where all the puddles live
C	that's what I do with this house
A	just where all the puddles live we don't mind
C	I'd prefer them to live there
A	maybe I'll have a look
C	what d'you think you might be allergic? To something in there?
A	no it's just skimmed milk
C	Ohh but it
A	yeah
C	oh is that what you I thought you had UHT?
A	oh is that different?
C	UHT isn't real milk
A	Ohh
C	UHT is fake milk
A	oh I see
C	whereas actual milk is
A	hmm
C	so that might be where we're going wrong
A	maybe
C	so your body's not used to processing the the dairy?
A	yeah
C	ahh
A	maybe that's it
C	but then would it've been? That would've been the case in the froyo last week?
A	in the froyo yeah
C	I would've thought but I don't know
A	um
A	 I'm addicted to chocolate and love base jumping
C	obviously
A	base
C	that's where they jump from building to building isn't it?
A	I thought that was parkour
C	no that's what
A	really?
C	yeah
A	holy shit
C	what for cows?
A	yes
C	no it's not really normal for humans
A	he was high as a kite all the time
C	yeah
A	I think
C	mm
A	yours alright?
C	quite herby isn't it?
A	herby?
C	herb
A	it needs a blending
C	D'you want the blender?
A	oh yeah I'll do it now while I'm stood actually
C	the really nice quiet blender we have
A	yeah
A	come here
C	what is occurring?
A	is that does that the fridge talking again?
C	yeah
C	that was a bit of a scary time
A	let's leave the kitchen
A	I'm quite
C	ahh
A	um they're good for before I go running
C	mm
A	the best thing is to live at work
C	oh nice
A	sometimes I still have this
C	aha
A	no
A	the problem with this I've realized is that it's so liquidy that the
A	from the blender
A	Cos it's got so noisy I just stopped
C	stopped blending
A	but then I found chunks of tomato
C	yeah
A	D'you know what I think? I think it's because we're not patient enough to wait for it to blend
C	no
A	something yeah
C	it was making a quite difficult job for it
A	um he text me to ask how uh last weekend was
C	oh yeah
A	very nice blah blah blah
A	and I was like yeah wonderful blah
A	you up to anything nice this weekend? Oh no he asked me if we'd had a bet on the Grand National
C	mm
A	at work and I said actually no we didn't
C	yeah
C	I wonder if we poisoned ourselves
A	probably isn't
A	so
C	my horse fell over
A	I
A	yeah
C	so
C	sucks to be him
A	sucks to be you
A	um it what you doing is what you I said what you I hope you're doing you doing anything fun this weekend?  Oh I'm in
C	very grown-up
A	and he said oh that that sounds lovely that should be nice
C	mm
A	yes
C	so he's learned
A	yes that that was good
C	yeah
A	euuch
A	am I allowed to put this in here even if it's hot?
C	it's um uh yeah
A	what is that?
C	I dunno
A	uh-oh
C	oh that's fine you can just eat that when you it'll just be a bit of bit of flavour
A	must be a surprise
C	surprise
A	think it's just one rogue
A	one rogue piece of tomato
C	that's the winner
A	this soup is um looking rather watery
C	mm
A	yeah
C	might need to make some moor during the week
A	oh no as long as it fills this it'll it'll eat
C	it'll be alright
A	yeah
C	oh okay then
A	I don't haven't really considered about how I'm gonna get this container to work
C	um in your bag
A	oh yeah I mean
C	if you put it flat at the bottom of your sports bag
A	yeah
C	and then load it into the top
A	and in a few carrier bags
C	and a few carrier bags just in case what does it leek that one?
C	okay
A	the last one was the other one that I lent from
A	right that's the
C	done in the microwave
A	no this is the one with the blue thing came out
C	that's pretty hilarious
A	so maybe I want to try just a little bit of you
C	go go
A	go go
C	ah
A	yeah I put one chicken and one vegetable but I think I need more
C	yeah I definitely find that the the bouillon or whatever it's called lasts the like it really you really notice the flavour more than
A	yeah
C	when you use Oxo cos I think last week I only used one cube and it was um did add much more flavour to it
A	yeah
C	although loads of calories in there
A	is there?
C	two hundred and forty-three per hundred grams
A	think like you'd have to eat the whole thing wouldn't you? To eat a hundred grams
A	I think one's enough
C	A hundred and fifty
A	there you go
C	okay so the whole thing
A	yeah
C	so three hundred and seventy odd
A	so per spoonful
C	twelve
A	there's probably about yeah I was gonna say about about ten
A	did it actually say twelve
C	it said twelve
C	A natural enhancer of all soups stews casseroles sauces savories rice and grain dishes
A	it's quite full of itself isn't it?
C	as stock four teaspoons per litre
A	wondering how it says like for all stews I'm sure if I was making like crab stew that would
C	yeah
A	go with it
C	oh I put it everything
A	do you?
C	tastes nice
A	do you?
C	yeah
A	think I need some white pepper in
C	yeah help yourself
A	I have some in here
C	oh
A	there it is look
C	that's the fastest soup making in the west
A	well when you're as good a cook as I am
C	mm
A	I know
C	just don't know how you do it
A	years of practice
C	that'll be it
C	I mean I really do
A	alright
C	yeah
A	third edible soup in a row
C	oh my god she's only done it again
A	now put a bit of
C	oh I've
A	oh can I put soy sauce in? It's the salt I like of the soy sauce
C	the
A	yeah the salty taste
C	ah fucking hell every time
A	did you? What was it called? Grot?
C	garotte
A	just tried to garotte yourself? Are you okay?
C	aww yeah
A	Garotted
C	how is it seven o'clock already?
A	no
C	yes
A	take it back
C	yes
A	take it back
C	um I'm not Superman I'm afraid
C	should have a shower actually
A	right that means you're cooked
A	you're cooked
C	yeah
A	all the love
A	I'm always terrified when I clean this that I'm gonna cut my own fingers off
A	I need to do nothing
A	nothing
C	well at this point you have to make a decision whether to
A	did you try the pomegranate stuff yet?
C	the who?
A	the pomegranate stuff
C	pomegranate stuff
A	the
C	oh yeah I did try it the other day
A	smells good doesn't it?
C	yeah really really nice
A	yeah
C	like it's not overpowering
A	Hahaha
C	did you just fill that whole thing up with boiling water?
A	yes
C	right
A	when you say it like that it sounds crazy
A	what's going in the soup today?
C	um today um
A	what?
C	we have um some tomatoes
A	yes
C	we added garlic
A	what you mean you actually fried it?
C	I fried yeah I mean I know it's not it's a pretty
A	in the Union
C	um but I did
A	by your fair hand from scratch with a garlic
C	by my fair hand
C	wouldn't have it any other way
A	yeah
C	um I did red lentils stock hot water passata salt black pepper and
A	goodness
C	and your aunt
A	and
C	and your
C	yeah
A	done
C	not done
A	because you're supposed to boil it with the lentils
C	yeah I did at the beginning but then I
A	mm
C	I was really really getting ferocious
A	yeah
C	if I leave it on that
A	oh yeah you don't wanna do what I did to my soup that time and burnt it
A	that was extreme
C	what I'll do
A	yeah
C	and then when I got to the bottom of the pan I realized it was because it was black
A	right
C	so that went really well I really enjoyed that soup that cancer that I was cooking
A	yeah yeah
A	try one
C	yeah it's like inoculations you know?
A	yeah yeah
C	I think
A	yes I think so
C	cancer sausages
A	ham and cancer sausages yeah
C	you haven't got any cancer sausages left have you?
C	Good
C	I've eaten all the cancer
C	obviously
A	with all the good stuff
A	can't leave those beauties lying around for someone
C	no
A	Tom Dick or Harry
C	no Absolutely
C	I'm going to
C	have a very quick shower and then come and check on this
A	that sounds wise
C	you may see if there's a good family movie
A	yeah
C	if not you're gonna have to enact something for me for my own entertainment
C	A play
A	well I think it's going going to include gurgly tummy and cancer sausages
A	I'll get on that
C	if you could
