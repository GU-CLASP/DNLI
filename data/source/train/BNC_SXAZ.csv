B	yeah
A	a posh play you know
B	yeah
A	and er
C	mm
A	and she was
B	I know
C	yeah
A	how come they could
B	yeah
A	so that she could actually do a play
C	yeah
A	but she
C	mm
A	and the concentration and
C	but she did
B	but

B	well poor old woman she had both arthritis she had osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
A	mm
B	and she every moment she screamed in pain
C	mm
A	oh right

A	you can't tell if there's one
B	you can't tell
A	there's er
B	no you can't no
A	there's er
C	you can't certainly
B	but I mean
A	there's a structure
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	there was nothing else to
A	I think that's an old folk's tale
B	I think it's a load of rubbish
A	cos that's what
B	yeah
A	ah yeah
B	which means there's nothing else that they could do for you you just sit sit down and wait
B	yeah it probably be alright when you snuff it
A	ah you told me all that I think
B	yeah
C	I haven't claimed it
B	well really a boiler
C	we haven't claimed it
B	right we haven't have we?
C	no
A	I gotta call this one cos they
C	oh yeah
B	yeah?
A	and they said oh since
C	PPI
A	I lost the call case or something like that you're now entitled to PPI repaying it
B	that's it yeah
C	mm
A	I think that home
B	that was yeah
C	mm
A	and I think
B	our
C	yeah
A	who
C	mm
A	but I know loads of people
B	yeah
A	cos that's
C	I don't understand how
A	I don't understand you know I just don't
B	really yeah
A	and they said that they now put another sum of about nine billion aside
B	yeah
A	and where do they get these billions from?
B	ah we don't know where they get them from I mean it's
A	yeah they say this is like
B	yeah
A	billions in it
C	yeah
A	and it's like you know big pay and just that is that all gonna cost me about
B	for the
A	for the
B	yeah yeah
A	whereas they got gold cases
B	yeah claiming it from the other other companies
A	no no no from they have this scheme
A	and got it for compensation
B	yeah
B	well I see yeah
A	on well of course everybody
A	came along claimed this hugely
C	mm
B	yeah
A	someone who might've gone out fishing
C	mm
B	I see
A	just for fun
B	that's it yeah
C	oh dear
A	these clients all got paid out
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know to keep it quiet
B	yeah
A	and get to get the money back claim the money back
B	oh my goodness
A	which you think
B	yeah it's fair enough but I mean you know the poor people well I say poor people cheating people that have now spent it all away
A	well exactly I should imagine in that area where that happened there's been a massive booming
B	oh yeah
A	sales and what else
B	oh yeah yeah that's right
A	you know I bet everyone's got a new boat and a new
B	yeah yeah
A	house and a new this and a new car
B	I bet they do yeah
A	mm
B	oh well
C	mm
A	where do you reckon is the
B	oh well I did hear
A	no no this one you'd think about
B	would would you?
A	yeah you would think about it
B	yeah?
A	Exxon?
B	Exxon
A	which is the old Esso
B	that's right yeah
C	yeah
A	they said that their turnover is like
B	wow
A	and you think that
B	yeah
A	then you got China
B	yeah
A	then you probably got Germany
B	yeah
A	oh and then you got Britain
B	yeah
A	then you got France
B	yeah
A	so then the equivalent of France is their annual
B	yeah?
A	yeah they're making
C	mm
A	the
C	ah
A	is just absolutely phenomenal
B	they just
A	turned around and said oh well investing no we won't unless you give us all this stuff
B	well what was that that was was that I don't think that was Exxon
A	nah no no
B	who was that?
A	that was a chemical company
B	that was a chemical company oh okay
A	that was you know
B	yeah
A	been brought up by someone else in China as it's
B	yeah
A	but there's another one in Nigeria did exactly the same thing
C	yeah
A	they don't worry
B	oh they don't care about claiming people do they?
C	mm
B	that's right you know
B	yeah
A	well you might as well
B	well but it's no yeah
A	cos obviously only one thing that I
B	in making more money
A	yeah the only one thing that affect them is about losing money
B	yeah
A	so if you
B	is it?
A	well America's terrible innit? in things like that
B	well that's right yeah
A	the more you hear about it
B	yeah
A	the
C	mm
B	is it but it's the land of the free
A	yeah
B	as long as you got plenty of money
A	yeah
C	I'm gonna take the fuel okay?
B	yeah okay
C	we shouldn't take the fuel there
A	no
C	no I don't think so
B	oh tell him about that other stuff we bought
C	what?
A	no no I know that'd be alright
C	what?
B	what
A	well she only we bought some stuff that you passed out for the
B	no
A	bought this
B	sounds
C	I think it was
B	I thought that was
C	that tiny little
B	another top about that big
C	yeah
A	where did you get it?
B	it cost me twenty quid
A	where did you get it?
C	we got it on
B	it protects your wood against borer insects
C	I kept it
A	yeah
B	and we thought oh well
A	well
B	five gallons that's supposed to be but
C	here it is
A	why don't you get five
C	well when we saw it on the internet we
A	we thought that was a big can
C	a big kind of tin
A	oh this is water-based
B	yeah
A	this is is looks like the stuff I had when I
C	yeah?
A	er temperature it was but that was water-based
B	yeah?
A	but anyway I used
B	yeah?
C	that's what we use
A	you get the five gallon can that's about thirty-six quid you know
C	yeah that's
B	yeah yeah
A	and that's
C	that's what we've always used
A	yeah
B	we've always used that
C	I love that and then
C	when we saw this on the net we thought this is it
B	and that that looked like a five gallon
A	I did it
B	right?
A	yeah I did it erm there was no way that that actually I'm not
C	but that is
B	nineteen pounds forty-nine pence
A	but there's nothing in there
C	it's it's no no cos we've used it
B	well that's only herbs
A	that's it
C	a herb in it
B	mm I don't know
A	did you do the whole lot?
C	well we put it made it into a five gallon
A	oh I see this was a
B	yeah
C	mm
A	which you then mixed up with water
C	the tiny little is
A	ah I see
C	not even filled the thing up
B	it smells of rosemary and thyme
C	and there're little herbs in like like tea tea
B	and there're
A	oh well it's not so bad if you moved to
C	don't you think so?
A	nah
C	there's no ingredients on it
A	no
C	I think it must be a colourful end
B	but it's made in Canada
C	er yeah
B	yeah
A	a life-time solution
B	no I made five gallons with that
A	yeah I know it's not too bad
B	no it's not doing too badly
A	thirty quid is
A	mm
B	doesn't hurt animals and doesn't hurt anything but that protects against wood borer insects and and
A	is this what was going on on the floor?
B	no that's going on on the
A	oh no no that's
B	yeah it would
A	no sorry when I when I had the house
C	but it
B	yeah
A	they used a water-based
B	yeah
A	stuff I just went around and sat down with these
A	and I think even the
B	was it? yeah?
A	cos it was some sort of
B	well when
A	no no
B	masks and stuff
A	well these guys they they when they did the walls
B	yeah
A	and they came in with these massive
B	yeah
A	and they sort of sprayed everything
B	yeah?
A	I assume it worked it's guaranteed to twenty-five years but
B	yeah well this is supposed to be guaranteed too
C	well you know
A	I've been fighting my hedge trimmer
B	did it?
A	well it did the the exhaust kinda way
B	oh god yeah
A	and as I
B	oh
A	had to dismantle it check it all out
B	oh christ
A	you know and these
B	yeah yeah
A	and
B	that's right yeah
A	a bit always goes off and goes down the side
B	it
A	you know and it was impossible to
B	that's right yeah
A	then I got them together again and I
A	this time I'd put it in
B	oh oh
A	and I cut the thread on it and I cut a thread in the hole
A	well they weren't a really cheap set
B	yeah
A	you know it gets all a bit
B	yeah yeah
A	well these were sort of
B	ah
A	ground that off till it was too
B	yeah till they
B	that's right
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh it's not an easy job
B	well sure yeah
A	and er I got it down and
B	yeah
A	and left it for two days I put it together this morning
B	oh god
A	bearing in mind you can get hedge cutters
B	that's right yeah
A	those came in at four hundred and ninety quid and there
B	didn't you?
A	and
B	yeah
B	yeah well
A	I think
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	did you? oh right yeah0
A	when they moved out did
B	well that was alright
A	well it was
A	well I've done a lot of work when I used this sort of
B	mm
A	but I might not've used it that a lot
B	no
A	and it always works
B	yeah
A	going wrong
B	yeah
A	to do serious edgings you know
B	well I got the electric one if you wanna borrow that
A	yeah yeah I might
B	cos I cut mine with that you see?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and cut
A	when
B	and cut it like that as well
A	yeah
B	and then when you've done all that you come up that way and cut it that way you see?
A	yeah I'll probably
B	yeah
A	I thought that'd be easier but
B	they're heavy old yeah
A	well the thing is they should
A	yeah well
B	yeah
A	so that it tights away and all you do is swing it back
B	that's it yeah
A	but the trouble is is that
B	yeah yeah
A	but you know to get it
B	yeah that is
A	yeah but the thing about
B	yeah yeah
A	and it's much more balanced rather than holding it there and
B	that's right yeah
A	it's all sort of
B	yeah
A	you know sort of
B	oh I see
A	and you get hold of the you know the hand of
B	yeah
A	and it's all balanced of that other end so you can move it
B	yeah
A	by it rather than take it out
B	yeah
A	and you're dropping down and stuff you know
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah I know cos I have them again this week
B	do you? oh I didn't know
A	yeah
B	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	A is going to work with balancing stuff in the coming week	Neutral
A	yeah and I get
B	anyway I was cutting the hedge off and then I come across this long
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	robins nests cut the robins nests
A	they're at the back of my garden where they er
B	oh right yeah
A	cos I'd been complaining all the triangles were going through and the kids were hurting themselves and
A	couldn't I get rid of them
B	but they don't cut
A	but they don't cut their side no it's all growing up quite tall
B	yeah
A	the trouble is it changed all the shape of my
B	oh yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A doesn't have birds in their garden	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	complain if it goes six foot tall
A	what? well I think it already is
B	yeah but
[ANNOTATION]	A lives by a forest	Neutral
A	no I think it's eight foot it's
B	is it? eight? I thought it was six foot if you got
A	yeah no I think is eight for
B	is it? alright
A	yeah
B	well that's
A	but they er anyway
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	A has already complained about their high hedges	Neutral
A	I'll put an act to them that if they let it get overhung
B	yes
A	there's there'll be there isn't gonna be a way to deal with it
B	no
A	you see? it's the fact that they
B	yeah yeah
A	keep it on top of them
[ANNOTATION]	Bs garden is full of robins nests	Neutral
B	yeah
A	well I don't know like there's a
A	come in at the weekend and you know
B	yeah
A	no
B	oh the news this morning
A	yeah?
B	ashwood is what they
A	yeah I know what you mean no sign of it in my garden
B	well that happened but I've never had it
A	but
B	did it very well but there's not much really
A	well I'll have to check out for wood there's a lot of ash trees and well I've had this ash tree
B	yeah
A	and they thought it was dying by it and I thought oh is that ash
B	no no
A	there was no
B	no cos it
A	but the rest of it suddenly sprayed out and that's grabbed
B	yeah yeah
A	so I don't know what really
B	yeah
A	well I think that that
B	yeah yeah that's right
A	so the rest of it should be alright
A	mm well that's right I mean a lot of these things is like they get resistant to these things
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	yeah
B	anyway
A	that's right yeah
B	yeah
A	cos they sort of found all grounds where they've survived and
B	yeah
A	and cloned them and they then
B	that's right
A	they're coming back up
B	I
A	but they grow with like
B	no no I know they grow every week yeah
A	they seed bloody everywhere
B	bloody everywhere yeah
A	yeah
A	mm mm
B	I let them grow there but I can't keep them under under control
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but there's one in the garden next to mine
B	yeah
A	well I looked at it the other day certainly yes
A	and I certainly found a loop
B	yeah
A	I mean it don't take long to get up there
B	no it don't know they're
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but not all
A	yeah
B	and that's what we got
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there's a suspended thing and this
B	yeah they do don't they? yeah
A	and if you think about it
B	yeah
A	you know? cos on the wrong way
B	you only
A	and there was one that was a bit annoying cos this was in the east you know
B	yeah
A	but there was one which I actually cut down and
B	yeah
A	they started cutting down
B	that's
A	they managed to survive
A	the sycamore?
B	yeah
A	that's
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I don't know how to snap but
A	mm
B	oh horrible
A	you know like
B	and rust down the leaves and all all awful
A	yeah
B	no they are not
A	you know
B	no so I got two down there I'll cut them down this Christmas
B	they're ruining my fence
A	mm
B	but that might make good wood
A	no?
B	not next year
A	not next year
B	well next year I can probably
A	well
B	he works out
A	or maybe that
B	he would do he's at the hospital
A	yeah or well
B	did he?
A	yeah
B	oh oh
A	he had a
B	when when erm our friend
B	and then you can have him
A	mm
B	but they hate each other
A	yeah mm
B	that's it
A	you don't have to be buddies do you?
B	no we don't have to be buddies but them two hate each other they detest each other
A	yeah that
B	well I mean
A	some people do carry a grudge don't they?
B	yeah but most of
B	yeah yeah well yeah that's true
A	and also
B	yeah yeah
A	and that er one
B	yeah
A	and he said well why do people act like that?
B	yeah
A	you know pretend that they can't help much
B	yeah that's it
A	and then you think well hang on a minute
B	or all those
A	and now
B	yeah
A	same idea as I was saying
B	yeah
A	and er I'd just put a new bracket on cos the when you put it down there's a little melted bracket which is not
B	yeah
A	so I'd put a new one of them on and
B	mm yeah
A	and they said oh you know thanks for helping out okay cheerio or something and they wouldn't've labelled or discovered that it was
B	well you wouldn't think they'd done it
A	and I thought that was
B	yeah yeah
A	and then the little
B	yeah
A	and I was so
A	god you know
B	that's right yeah
A	someone's
B	yeah
A	that's the thing
B	yeah
A	you know cos it wasn't his he didn't have to worry about it he could just
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and then drive them flat out everywhere
B	well that's
A	and scream them around
B	well
A	they just treat it really badly
B	well on on on on television who's
A	mm
B	and they just talk er
A	Clarkson
B	Clarkson that's it he says er I don't
A	mm
B	and he'd
A	mm
B	an old wooden bridge and that
A	yeah well this is a blooming attitude
B	yeah
A	but it's why I find it
B	so do I
A	and that as I was talking about people who hire cars
B	yeah
A	cos the people are saying that they scratched they scratched them
B	I know yeah
A	well
B	of course it does yeah
A	you know? and when you get people who like you say hire a car
B	yeah
A	then
B	well what we did when when
A	mm
B	all around the car
A	mm
B	when on the day that
A	mm
B	but they walked round the car looked at it and said oh that's fine
A	mm
B	you know but I thought well
A	well then at
B	are they? yeah?
A	yeah when you hire a van or something
B	yeah
A	and you know all the vans got scratches on them
B	yeah
A	and you just sort of point them out as you pick it up yeah yeah alright yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and then if you had to make a big hole in it they won't worry
A	mm
B	that's the point and you're chucking stuff in the back and then
A	but at one time used in Norwich there used to be this rent a wreck
B	did they? I can't remember that one
A	car place
B	oh
A	it was used to be up near the airport
B	mm
A	and they used to have
B	no but
A	and as far as we were concerned
A	they were blooming good cars
B	good cars yeah
A	yeah as but they'd be about five years old
B	yeah
A	and you know be a few dings and scratches on them but
B	yeah
A	perfectly alright you know
B	mm
A	your
B	yeah
A	in case they broke down
B	yeah
A	then
B	no
A	or anything like that
B	no that's weird ain't it?
A	it's surprising they don't someone
B	well it is ain't it really
A	job done?
C	no
A	no not quite
C	starting
B	you're now starting?
A	god I dunno where we'd be without women it's like
B	yeah so's she
B	it make you tired watching it
A	yeah yeah
B	but as soon as she sits down
B	gone
A	yeah it's like
B	and she says if I sit down I'll go to sleep so
A	mm
B	it's a waste of time
A	but with me if I can put off doing a job I will
B	me too er isn't it awful
A	but
B	yeah yeah
A	I can relax
B	sit down and relax or read a book or something
A	you know whereas she'd sort of think oh it's er a window of opportunity
B	I think of all the things I could do and then think oh
A	mm it's the same with me
B	I mean it's
A	I mean I I got to the stage now where I I can be quite busy in the morning
B	yeah
A	but
B	but by the afternoon that's it yeah
A	you know unless there's something I really wanna do
B	you've had enough that's right yeah
A	I've pulled a muscle
B	oh that hurt don't it?
A	like bottom rib you know where I mean?
B	yeah I know the place
A	and do you know how I did it? I just went down the garden
A	and er
[ANNOTATION]	A have pulled a muscle around their bottom rib	Entailment
B	well yeah
A	so that was a good excuse not to do anything for
B	yeah
A	god I was looking into the price of
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A thinks that pulling a muscle is a good excuse to not do anything	Entailment
A	but then they sort of sell quite decent ones for three hundred quid
B	yeah
A	or one which you think mm would probably work alright for a couple of hundred quid
B	no
A	there's nothing worse than having er
B	won't start no
A	or something like that or when it does go you know you hit something a bit hard and it just
B	oh that's it yeah
A	I'm sure it was
B	god that was hard work that do take it out of you don't it? I mean
[ANNOTATION]	hitting something hard usually feels good	Contradiction
A	warm day yeah
B	oh yeah
B	and the and the sun were on the other side of the hedge
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	B has never worked in his life	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	warm days are the worst days of the year	Contradiction
B	the sun were sun's like it is now right in your eye
A	mm should've cut that side first then
B	I should've done shouldn't I
B	yeah but I what happened? I was doing that other things and then I thought
A	yeah
B	I will go and cut the hedge
A	that's right I will have some achievement for today
B	yeah
A	I know yeah
B	and
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the sun bothers B when B cuts the hedge while the sun is on the other side of it	Entailment
B	the thing I hate about cutting hedges like that like that one out there
A	mm
B	is you gotta clear it all away afterwards
A	so you don't all leave it there?
A	yeah I know
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	B doesn't like everything about cutting hedges	Entailment
A	he just said oh leave it all on the grass
B	did he?
A	yeah yeah he said cut that I says well do you want me to clear it up as well?
B	oh
A	yeah
A	that was a thorn hedge I mean there wasn't
B	no
A	so I sort of did it every year or twice a year
B	oh yeah
A	there's plenty enough but it's quite a big wide bush
B	yeah
A	and no one walked on it apart from dog walkers and
B	yeah
A	and the grass tend to grow over it
B	yeah course it does yeah
A	he said no you know
B	yeah I couldn't I couldn't leave it out there
A	ah
B	arching down
A	tell me about it my arms were like ribbons
B	yeah
A	cos that's why
B	if you leave it there you can't get out can you?
B	that's it yeah
A	and you're trapped you know
B	that's it yeah ah and then you
A	yeah
B	you get up on your legs and you can't get up
A	yeah there's a job I've been doing this week cos I was
B	yeah
A	and I cut all the older bits it had and then the new bits and made long bits
B	yeah
A	I layered it along maybe for next year
B	oh that's it yeah
A	and
B	yeah that's it
B	a bit of that nice er
A	well
B	you know you got some
A	yeah
B	you know the
A	what that yeah yeah you
B	yeah
A	alright yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah they're beautiful and they got
B	blackberries are better that big
A	mm
B	yours are nice big ones they're
A	well the thing about it is is that they're sort of cultivated cross-road with
A	so I'm never quite sure what the
B	no I know that's true yeah
A	well that's it with gardening first of all because them
B	yeah
A	yeah I can probably if they have that but
B	yeah
A	I'm not so sure of what they got
B	yeah
A	but what you have to do is you have to get in there months
B	yeah
A	and cut the dead stuff out and then get those stuff and drag it
B	drag it yeah
A	so you can't get a bit streamed round behind so
B	yeah
A	you put your hands through that and
A	get in that stream
B	oh yeah I saw it
A	I put it round again so I can get it dragged and then pull it back
B	yeah
A	but even so you know you got
B	yeah
A	but then you can't tie the string
B	you can't tie the string no
B	yeah
A	and then you need the third end to to tie the string
A	very
B	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	but there again you know
B	well that's it then
A	well that's right I mean the thing is that if you er
B	that's a
A	you could earn money
B	yeah
A	you'd be earning money and
B	they do they
A	you could buy whatever you want
B	you wouldn't be doing it at all would you?
A	apart from the old
B	well yeah yeah
A	no idea of it
B	yeah
A	no
B	you know so
A	mm
B	so we never never had anything like that
A	someone
B	spread
A	mm someone could turn this place into
B	yeah they could yeah
A	you know
B	yeah yeah
A	got a lot
B	well that's
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	where
A	no a little shelf about that big cos then
B	what?
A	a new thing
B	yeah you got the
A	you got the
A	and box of screws and then you got to juggle bits to get the bits of wood and then you got layers and got
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	what?
A	glue
B	yeah
A	could've used just bloody glue couldn't I?
B	yeah you could've done yeah that's
A	yeah and
B	well that's all
A	yeah that'd be the answer certainly
B	yeah it would be
A	cut a bit of wood up cut round it
B	yeah
B	oh in the plaster or
A	in the plaster
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you've done that the hard way
A	mm
A	well
B	if the bricks were in the back yeah
A	I know you need a
B	a good drill yeah you do you need a
A	and a good drill will
B	but if you got
A	yeah
B	I know I got some cheap ones
A	yeah
A	yeah I know what you mean
