A	that goes on there right?
C	I bet you've got little joints
A	yeah mm yeah fit that in there
C	mm
A	then just take it out
C	ah I see and it and it should spin around and go over the terminal
A	and yeah
C	well what's wrong with that? nothing wrong with that that should work shouldn't it?
A	it should work but it doesn't so you've got to put them over the terminal and they've got these have got to go underneath in that that
B	are you nearly ready to eat?
A	yeah thank you
C	and that goes there
A	but it did work before I pulled it to pieces
C	did it?
A	yeah but you couldn't pull the you couldn't pull the pull it to switch it on or
B	yeah
B	because it hasn't got all the
A	yeah that's what it
B	but it might now
C	was it doing that before?
A	yes
C	so maybe it's not spinning properly
A	if you look at that inside there if you take all that all well we'll do that after dinner
B	with the connections? that's all
A	the connection goes like this you pull it and the connection goes ping and then you let it go and it
C	and it's supposed to stay on
A	yeah
C	and then you click it and it comes off
A	that's right
C	so maybe it's something's not quite is the tap working okay?
A	shall we put some light on?
C	is the tap working? is the tap working in there?
A	yeah the tap's working alright
B	you can right these are cream cheese and these and they're they're just ordinary cheese and you've got pickle here and okay? here's a knife
B	okay
C	there's still hot water in there
A	well that's it's not this water
B	there's
C	he's really his name is actually
B	is it?
C	yes but the moment he's walked into the church he felt freezing so he decided he would change his name to
B	oh right
C	you see?
B	very good
C	so when you ask him what his name is he's
B	ah
B	would you like some tomato juice?
C	yes please
A	just remind
B	it's it's quite different
A	I'm not turning the electric off again
B	yeah
A	because I've got two bare wires hanging in there
C	that's what I did that's what I did with with
B	did you?
C	yeah with when I was doing the vicar's straight after lunch I got back up there grabbed hold of it and it went poop
C	and off it went and it gave me a little tingle and just like went poop so
A	what are you doing with this thing?
B	well I don't know if that mixed up properly so I'll just make sure now
A	ah
A	are you doing anything for the the for Christmas fair taking anything down for Christmas fair?
B	no I've got some stuff to take
A	yeah we've some stuff to give away
C	mm
B	are you doing anything? are you doing that?
C	I'm not doing the fair I'm just putting the banner up just now to
B	which which one are you talking about
B	yeah
C	I can't be at the fair because I'm ringing bells at
A	that's not a fair
C	oh
C	that's gonna make me creak a bit as well isn't it doing that?
A	mm yeah
C	it's it's a bit of a worry
A	just
C	we've got three lovely ladies from
A	oh right
C	so we're all now right everyone go one two three four one two three four and she goes and she's going one two three four one two she can't count the
B	oh
C	and they say right now all ring your bells any bells and just go ding ding ding ding and
C	she's going she can't she said but I'm counting one two three four and and
A	I'll go
C	well no it's okay we we they have they have a plan somebody else is gonna play her notes so she can go ding dong wherever she wants really
C	erm but someone else will be playing her notes as well behind her
B	oh that's not fair
C	well the thing is she loves it but I I've I
B	mm
C	you know you you actually the top bells play the tune and the harmony's coming in lower down so if you know the carol you kind of know when you've got to play
B	yeah
C	because you can hear what your bells are doing
B	mm
C	but she can't
B	I think it needs do you want some?
C	yeah it's very sad really cos her her husband he has he's never had any legs
B	no?
C	and her husband's never had any legs and she looked after him all his life
A	oh
B	oh really? never
C	been born without legs yeah
B	gosh
C	and so she hadn't but
B	is that thalidomide?
C	pardon?
B	thalidomide?
C	probably cos it's about the right sort of age but erm she is she is enormous and she can't stand up for too long cos of the weight because obviously probably cos he's inactive she's inactive in a way because he he can't go out really apart from in a chair and she so she's she's gone she's
B	yeah
C	struggling but she's sort of alright erm but and then I I I was doing two particular notes that I thought when I got all sorted and then I turn up and and find some other lady's come back and she's now playing my notes so I've moved down one again but that's fine cos I can read music but it means I've got to concentrate even more cos I
A	mm
C	I was doing it sort of remotely yeah so I'm right down the bottom now which is fine you know so it's easy to find the notes if you've got the two bottom ones these are twelve bells you see
A	yeah
C	but what we're doing at at the posh concert at oh you have to come come come to
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is aware of thalidomide's purpose.	Entailment
C	it was open
C	mm
C	then they went around and that didn't work then they tried standing in the middle and that didn't work and so now they've they've booked the hall and we're gonna play in the hall but I'm one of the twelve there
B	oh
C	no more twenty-four notes but there's more than that because you're looking at four in front of you cos you've got your sharps and flats as well as your two two main notes and then you've got a sharp and your flats so you've got looking at four and they've given me the music which is helps because I can look through it but it's not the music I'll be looking at because we share music just you can't get enough in so we share
B	yeah
C	and I'm next door to
B	mm
C	warns me before you see and and put the flat down you want back to the natural that's it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C likes music.	Entailment
A	mm
C	ring them and go dong dong
B	oh
C	a nightmare because I'm and she's a she's an expert and so is
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A mentions someone who is a specialist.	Entailment
A	oh right
C	erm but she but she is having to focus on what she's doing
A	mm
B	mm
C	cos I'm on two bells down the which are about not right down the bottom to other people below me erm and then there's
B	right
C	there's this one piece it keeps going from it starts off four in a bar then you get the odd
A	mm
C	and if you don't
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The bar is close to the neighbourhood.	Neutral
C	there's it's really well I find it quite complicated
B	yeah
C	actually but when it's going well it's very satisfying and when you've finished and you think well that was nice it was really lovely
B	mm
C	erm but there's only two of us erm moved from the the new group the early group that they've picked up at
A	you can't have this pickle can you?
C	no
A	it'll make you cough
C	mm there's only two erm and that was erm
[ANNOTATION]	4 people changed to the new group.	Contradiction
B	oh dear
C	so we're not seeing her now which is a great pity cos she was good
A	yeah
C	and she was very very confident and good but never mind
A	and when has she got to have her operation?
C	I haven't heard we're just we're not even sure if we're supposed to know but
[ANNOTATION]	Someone will be operated in the arm.	Neutral
A	mm
C	not with us she didn't actually tell
A	no
B	no
C	but I think it's right that we know
A	mm
C	because I mean she'll come back afterwards
B	it's difficult though if you know and you know don't know if you're meant to know
C	don't know if she knows yeah
B	so if she ever says anything
C	mm
B	do you pretend you didn't know?
C	mm mm
C	and then react it's very difficult isn't it?
A	it's like like when we when we were around
B	oh yeah
A	with her boyfriend
B	that's right
C	mm
A	but
B	we asked
A	so I said to her how are you getting on with your boyfriend then? how are you getting on with your love life or something like that?
C	mm mm
A	but she said no that's finished
C	mm yeah difficult
B	yeah
C	just
B	that's easier though than than someone's been ill and not
C	mm yeah
B	it's difficult isn't it?
C	mm
B	do you say how how are you or
C	yeah
B	do you ignore?
C	I get the feeling she's had a had a difficult life she was born she was born in South Africa but erm and I think she's on her own now but she's got two daughters
A	mm
C	I think about twenty-seven and twenty-eight twenty-seven and twenty-nine
A	yeah
C	mm
A	like that girl on Countdown I suppose
C	oh her yeah yeah mm
B	she's brilliant
C	well it's not the same though the same one now is it? it's a different one a new one now
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah but she's even more brilliant than the
C	oh is she?
B	yes yes
A	yeah
C	oh mm
A	you'd never beat her she's fantastic she really is
B	mm
A	I don't know how they get this
B	that's peanut butter
C	oh
A	sense of numbers cos she can look at the numbers and say oh this one's got to be difficult
C	mm
A	or that's dead easy or whatever
C	mm
A	and you've got six different numbers
B	not always
A	and people people yeah but people can choose whether they want little ones or big ones
C	yes oh yes I remember
A	or a mixture
C	I remember yeah
A	and someone had four big ones and two little ones yesterday didn't they?
B	mm just almost impossible but they seem to manage it
A	yeah
C	I might have put it back differently you know?
A	what?
C	to you
A	put what back?
C	that back
A	oh
C	mightn't I? but was it it was all clicking and not doing anything?
A	that was all clicking and not and er this little contact when you pull it it goes click and move underneath
C	mm
A	supposedly live contact?
C	yes
A	and when you pull it again and it goes click and move out of the way and then the other one comes around and does it as well
C	yeah but it's not it's probably worn on that
A	no no no
C	no?
A	I've tried and I looked at them the whole point is that worked before I took it to pieces didn't it?
C	why did you take it to pieces then?
A	cos you couldn't pull the string
C	but now you can pull the string but it's not working
C	oh I see oh well so it should
B	mm
C	oh it's got to do with the way it is then?
A	yeah
C	the way around it
A	yeah yeah well it just would not pull down and when I
C	mm
A	and a spare screw that laid in the bottom
C	are you sure that hadn't come out from somewhere?
A	no that I didn't come out there's nowhere it can go in
C	mm
A	but he was a stupid electrician anyway
C	oh right
B	yes he was he was erm in the middle of a move he he lived down just just down the road here just down on the corner anyway and erm we used to look after his goat when they went away on holiday and he used to come here
A	so we thought being a friend we'll have him do the electric
B	a really nice guy
A	a lovely bloke a lovely bloke
B	but when he started doing this house he was moving to er the sea where was it?
A	mm
C	mm
A	to the shower and we said that cannot go there you know? he weren't with it
B	yeah and erm oh in the end cos we switched on one light in the living room
C	mm
B	and all these lights went off
A	yeah
B	but he was he was doing some silly things and then he used to say oh you don't want to put a socket near there that's a stupid place to have it you know you don't want all these sockets and
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A hired a friend to do the electric	Entailment
A	yes we do we want sockets
B	we didn't have that many
A	the more sockets you've got the less work I suppose
B	and then he then he put the we had a television point up in one of the bedrooms
A	and no plug to plug the
B	and no no
A	television point
B	and we'd we put it all down on our plans but he completely missed that out you see? yeah it's still like that isn't it?
A	yeah
B	with no socket
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is not satisfied with the electric job in their house	Entailment
A	we've got we've got a television and we don't have television up in the in the bedroom anyway
B	yeah
A	we tried it and it was horrible
B	the girls did they put it on
C	mm
A	the girls had one in their room
B	they bought their own what can you do? we didn't agree with it but they brought their own
A	yeah moved back and decorated
B	it's kind of kind of unsociable isn't it?
C	it is really
[ANNOTATION]	Televisions deprive people of social interactions	Entailment
B	yeah
A	plus they can't they can't er do homework and stuff like that with the television on can they?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Televisions don't distract children from their homework	Contradiction
C	no
B	no he bought one for ten pound you see and then they painted it up and
A	painted it and you always said they made a lovely job of it
B	yeah
B	mm?
C	she wanted one it's got one on Freecycle
A	oh right
C	a small one seventeen inch which is what she wants to go on her trolley because hers hers has gone
A	who's that?
[ANNOTATION]	Someone they are speaking about wants a television in their trolley	Entailment
A	oh
B	oh
C	she got one on Freecycle cos you can't you can't if they're not flat screen you can't sell them now
A	no
B	no
C	so they were giving this one away and that will suit her
[ANNOTATION]	You cannot sell a television if they are not flat screen	Entailment
A	mm
C	cos it would just sit on her trolley
B	can you still use it?
C	yeah Freeview Freeview box
B	oh yes you can can't you? mm yeah
C	mm and erm so but
A	that's an awful place
B	what did you go and pick it up did you?
C	mm?
B	you went and picked it up did you?
C	no she asked me if I would and I said I would but I'm terribly busy at the minute I am and I thought I might should should catch up today a bit I hope I do
B	mm?
C	has it stopped? it's looking a bit brighter out there isn't it actually? no it's still raining
A	no that's a bit
B	mm
C	it's still raining isn't it?
B	mm?
C	yes it is still raining
A	well
C	oh I think it's still I think it's still coming down now I might just have to go and get wet and stick it up I want to I want to do it you know it's got to be done
A	mm
C	so I mean I could hang on all week and it's good if it's up there for the when the fair's on
A	mm
C	and we're playing there as well the bells
A	are you?
C	we're not practising that and they said oh you'll be alright
A	have another sandwich
C	thank you the tune comes through and then then it gets more complicated and the third verse is very complicated and we I've never done the third verses and they're saying oh you can read it that's alright
B	yeah
C	so I'm gonna be doing
B	yeah
A	well it's all experience
B	what are you doing for mm?
A	all experience innit?
B	mm what are you doing for Christmas?
C	I don't know yet not really
A	you've not told
B	when?
C	fourth of January
B	oh right
A	oh my goodness is that expensive?
C	it can be thirty pounds or sixty pounds
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	or fifteen pounds I think I'm gonna ask him to go and get one cos he's
A	mm
B	oh right
C	I mean here this is complicated
A	it'll be even more complicated this time of year
C	yeah so I might I think I might ask him just to go and get the thirty pound one but I have already bought little presents you know little sort of five and ten pound presents for them anyway
B	well
B	oh
C	but so I don't know I don't know what we're doing really
A	yeah
B	mm
C	oh we saw saw
B	did you?
C	we went out to the
B	oh yeah
C	we went out to the
B	mm
C	the
B	oh right
C	so I booked a table and erm it's very good it it you can have a main on its own for ten pound choice of quite a big menu you know starting from a full roast to all sorts of other things but mains ten pounds you could have two courses it's eleven pounds if you had three courses it's twelve pounds
B	oh
A	that's alright innit?
C	it's quite good value and you know the erm
B	that's a bit strange isn't it?
A	yeah
C	not really so they just want people to come and sit and
B	yeah
C	so it's clever cos if you're staying for three you might have another drink and that's where the money is
B	yeah
C	it is quite clever really isn't it?
B	mm
C	so they they cover the table with the ten pounds don't they?
A	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
C	and there were only four couples in there
A	yeah?
C	and and
B	oh gosh
C	for three three of them three of the tables were people that knew band members
B	yeah
C	they they were husband and wife you know?
B	so it wasn't very well booked then
C	and one just one pair of a lot of people in the bar
B	oh I see
C	and some people who didn't want to sit with the band in another restaurant they've got two restaurants they've got the smaller one and this one
B	oh
C	and it was cold in there though
B	yeah
C	but it was alright for a band for playing because you didn't wanna wouldn't wanna be cooking would you?
A	no
C	and they're they're lovely because like the next one and then we gave them a hand and carried all the stuff back out after every so precise
A	yeah
C	erm and his harmonica playing is just he's been you know he's been doing that all these years that's what he was good at
A	yeah
C	harmonica kazoo and guitar he well he makes it sing anyhow they're having a the one of the I think it's the the bass player erm his wife at their church which is out that way
B	mm
C	this way as well erm they have each year a raffle for a Christmas hamper a big two hundred pound super-duper hamper you see erm between all the churches in the benefice which is a lovely idea so everybody so perhaps it's a fiver for to go in and it's for well more than paid for
A	yeah
C	I think and then you have to go to a gathering to to for when they do the prize draw and then they charge five pounds for you to go to the gathering for the prize draw
B	yeah
C	in this one church but there's there's they're playing and they're doing skiffle it's gonna they've got a skiffle band together
A	oh right
C	and that'll be fun so erm but you do but you've got mulled wine and mince pies and things
A	mm
C	and cakes and stuff afterwards so that's part of it so they're having a it's nice though they're having a party for the for the prize draw to see who's won the raffle they've all paid for anyway
A	yeah
B	right
C	but it's a clever way of raising funds isn't it? cos
A	yeah
C	you win win win
A	yeah
C	don't you?
B	well
C	so this this is in the church and erm so
B	yeah
C	that's on a that's on a Saturday night I think or is it? not this one next Saturday
A	oh
B	yeah I saw her this morning
C	did you? was she walking the dog?
B	mm
A	mm mm
C	she's quite happy now she got her she she the erm she got storage heaters and the one in her lounge packed up
A	storage heaters they're expensive they are
C	they've packed up well I mean er when the price of oil went up they were probably weren't
A	I dunno they're they're still
C	but then she couldn't well how it happened was that they they had a leak in their oil tank and when they worked out the price of what it was gonna cost for the new tank
A	mm
C	and that we thought
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	well we may as well get sorted so that we're not gonna have problems and and it was ever so difficult because at that time they only had one door into the house that was through the front
A	yeah
C	if they wanted to get to the garden they had to come out of the front and walk up the side and go to the bottom of the door in the back
B	mm mm
A	were they like that when they built them?
C	yeah there wasn't door in the back
B	that's illegal now isn't it?
C	they have two
A	it's illegal that is
B	yeah
C	they had two
A	yeah
B	well
C	they had two bedrooms
B	oh yes
C	two bedrooms at the back and then they built an extension on the back and put the door in at the same time
A	yeah
C	and they put an extension on the front but it must have been a really tiny bungalow to start with
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	erm and she said it was so difficult cos when I took the when I had to put the washing out I had to go out through the front door
B	yeah
C	grab all the kids take them around the back with me cos
B	yeah
C	I couldn't leave them on their own then you know fetch them all around the front again
A	it seems such a stupid
B	yeah
C	yeah well it was that's she was saying that's what what all we could afford at the time
A	yeah but it's a silly idea to have
B	for the
A	no back door
B	yeah
C	mm
A	into the garden I mean that might be
B	if you haven't got a garden it would be different
A	yeah
B	so
A	I mean flats only have one door don't they?
B	yes that's right yeah
C	mm mm
A	but I thought to build a bungalow or a house without with only one door still there you go that can can't be illegal
B	no it can't be
A	it probably won't come up to
A	builders' regs now
B	we saw on erm Homes Under the Hammer and we watch that quite a bit so this they had this up for auction and it's still got the tin bath in the kitchen
A	in the kitchen and you lifted the
B	you know with the
A	the worktop up in the kitchen
C	wow
A	yeah
B	and it
C	well we had a tin bath didn't we?
B	well yeah but I mean
C	we did but that was that
B	you don't expect it still now or do you?
C	no
B	and that was
A	telephone
C	that must be a grade one listed if it goes back that far with a tin bath in the kitchen
A	oh yeah
C	probably can't remove it
A	it's it's an absolute rubbish phone call I bet
B	yeah
B	no no it's not there
C	goes hello
A	does it?
C	hello hello
A	well it ain't mine
B	where is mine then?
A	I don't know where yours is cos
B	no
C	but they all do don't they all do?
A	mm?
C	they all do the same ring do they?
A	well I don't know I don't bother with them
C	mm
A	nobody knows my number nobody knows my
A	but if you think we were we were in
C	mm
A	well we didn't know at the time there was two
C	oh no
B	it's the it's the same store you know they have an upstairs and downstairs
C	oh yeah yeah
A	they had a right right up the top of the mall was was one
C	no
A	so I was waiting at the
C	and
A	yeah
B	three stores isn't it? three
A	well that's like
C	three one on top?
B	levels
A	so this is why we got er telephones and er only only
B	yeah and if it's less than
C	a chap came into
B	oh know
C	I said can't you phone her and he says no I can't
B	yeah it is annoying isn't it?
C	mm
A	and it's really handy if you've got
B	but then
A	I
B	well that's the risk
A	this is the problem I go out and forget my phone
C	yeah so have I got mine with me now? I haven't got mine with me now
B	yeah so then
C	mm
B	no it's okay oh well they're obviously still
A	do you want that last bit of sandwich look come on eat it up?
C	are you having it?
A	no I have had enough thank you
C	no I don't like taking the last okay thank you very much yeah you wouldn't have an old bit of cloth I could just wrap around this tree with it?
A	an old bit of cloth to wrap around a tree what
B	what's that?
C	before I put the rope on well you can hurt it if you take the bark off can't you?
A	it won't take the bark off that's not it won't be long enough
A	we don't have any old cloth have we? we used all our rags up
B	well I've probably got something upstairs if you want
C	I just think it's people can get funny can't they? it's not my tree it belongs to it's on the the land fillers
A	yeah
B	is it just the one tree?
C	well no it's two it's two trees and two trees and two
A	you've got to wrap two trees up
C	two bits of ropes well for just where the rope goes I thought I would just put a bit of tape on around first put something around then I'm not putting pressure on them perhaps I'm being
B	mm?
C	I can just tie it
A	I think it'll be alright
C	I'll plead ignorance
A	you didn't bring my shirts up did you?
C	mm?
A	you didn't bring my shirts up?
B	no we've got some to give back
A	no he said he was going to bring some long-sleeved shirts for me
C	I think I might have given you the wrong bag
A	yeah
C	you see but
A	never mind
C	well it doesn't matter but I have plenty of clothes anyway
A	of course you have
B	okay

C	you know and he's up in the night yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah but he had a very very busy day and went around and met all the people on their stalls you know?
B	mm
A	I think you should have been on television like

A	well I can't afford a fiver
C	yeah well we're going anyway
A	where is it?
C	she's kind of coming out of her shell a little bit I think
A	where is it?
C	erm well it's right over somewhere they are
A	well that's petrol and a fiver then
C	so erm hang on where do they live? erm it's the erm what's it called? oh no no no no
A	your head has gone
A	oh right
C	and turned it they were two cottages and they turned it into the
A	oh
C	so it's the
C	at erm where's where's that garden that the two queers have got?
A	oh at
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	no that's on the coast
B	okay
A	well that's
C	yeah yeah and and it's out it's out there oh my word we went the wrong way
A	yeah
C	and just and I'm thinking if we meet someone now I won't know where I can pull in they might know the road I don't know
A	no
B	mm
C	erm and then at one stage
A	did she?
C	she didn't like it yeah she said I don't like this her mum never would drive up on minor roads it had to be all major roads
A	oh right
C	maybe some
A	your dad used to go leery when there was grass in the road didn't he?
A	and he used to think oh look
A	nobody's been up here for a long while
C	mm
B	we we actually get scared at some of the
C	well at night and the weather wasn't good it was damp and erm we er the last time we went up to see him the satnav packed up and then you don't know where where you are when it packs up do you?
A	I don't think our satnav is working any more either
C	but anyway he erm
A	it's come to the end of its life
C	but stopped we stopped and I said
A	yeah
C	that was it so yeah
A	the satnavs are really weird because this road is unnamed you can't believe it can you?
C	mm
A	it's unnamed so they reckon on on Google anyway
C	mm
A	and if anyone come here following their satnav they never come here they finish up at the bottom of the road at the
C	oh
A	on the corner
C	yeah
A	then they have to stop and ask where we live cos there's only
C	it's the postcode
A	eight
C	that it goes to isn't it?
A	yeah
C	that's the centre of the postcode
A	there's only eight
B	that's right

A	not that's alright
C	what if you try it and it and it goes pop?
A	no it won't go pop that won't go pop it might go pop it might go pop but that won't go pop
C	if you tried sort of wire-wooling them the contacts
A	the the contacts are all fine because I've just given them a little scrape and looking at them
C	you did?
A	and they and they contact nicely
C	mm
A	but it isn't getting any feed electric feed in now that the feed is alive
C	mm
A	but for some reason or another it isn't getting into the
