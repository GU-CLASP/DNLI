B	no
C	I mean you have the
C	but he's still wearing his hat you see
C	it was big and orange

C	that's right so the hat's got to be off yes yes I understand
B	yeah
C	erm
B	erm
A	yeah

C	he's got his hat on
B	he's supposed to supposed to look a bit like he's

A	yeah he looks a bit faded
B	yeah that's the trouble cos I liked having him a bit opaque cos it makes him look a bit
B	I can make him not opaque
C	erm
B	that's okay
C	er in a sense I would leave that page out completely
B	yeah
C	right?
B	mm
C	I'd have to see it as a
C	see my my difficulty is is not seeing it as a whole

B	yeah
C	erm
B	I would
C	mm
B	I'll do it in here
C	but I
B	everyone's
C	right
C	but
B	I kinda wanted to do it as a kind of then I thought oh god I haven't got loads of money to do this
C	mm
B	but if I did a little story
C	yeah
B	of course it costs
C	mm
B	no money to
C	yeah exactly yeah
C	mm
B	more of a personal thing if they've now done it
C	no
B	up with
C	yeah
B	cos I asked erm
C	mm
B	and they they
B	and the kids as well they're like yeah
C	and he did look like a penguin but then

B	yeah cos I thought I wanted to do them a
C	mm
B	you know cos it's not really quite like a rabbit some of the
C	but it doesn't matter

B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	erm
B	erm Teletubbies yeah
C	you know?

B	yeah
C	give people
B	yeah
C	er because it's it's

B	mm
C	erm
B	yeah
C	but it doesn't give the flavour of the character of
B	mm
C	say my uncles and aunts
B	yeah
C	and my cousins
B	yeah
C	erm

C	and the second time round I just said
C	and
C	but I mean
B	I'm sure she's alright I'm sure she's fine
C	but and she might well be
B	oh
C	but
B	he has he
C	erm
B	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
C	each job
B	yeah
C	and get the whole house
B	yeah
C	now that would've been fine if they were happy
B	mm
C	and then they
B	yeah
C	and rented several houses
B	yeah
C	and then they split up
B	yeah
C	but were still
B	mm
C	erm
B	yeah
C	but though it's losing money hand over fist but you know?
B	yeah
C	he said look you can
B	mm
C	the shop
B	mm

B	borassic
C	oh oh my god
B	like a Brussels sprout like
C	oh brassica?

B	so this is probably the first time in a long time
C	mm
B	she's
C	mm
B	erm where
C	yes yes
B	she's having to
C	yes
B	and she will give out and she will kick off and react probably but
C	mm
B	you know that's that's her business
C	he's given her
B	oh my god much more really
C	you know?
B	and she was wasn't prepared to look after their son for it either
C	and
B	which is
C	and and
B	I'm quite disappointed actually
B	exactly she was like sort of
C	mm
B	he took
C	mm
B	no no wonder he
C	yes
B	it that's what the pressure was like he was absolutely right to leave
C	yes definitely
B	yeah
C	erm
B	but it's a bit like
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	and erm
C	mm
B	and no she'll she'll've been in the same position she'll be able to buy herself a house and be completely rent free or mortgage free
C	unless she goes for something big
B	oh no
C	it's up to her
B	it's up to her yeah it is
C	and she may have to sort of get a hand out of food
B	yeah yeah
C	erm
B	but also maybe you've
C	mm
B	cos sometimes I've felt very
C	mm
B	cross about it or frustrated but
C	yeah
B	if they've
C	yes
B	I am
C	yes
B	cross and the other people can get bitter and cross
C	mm
B	even though
C	mm
B	if you think you know you've er
C	that's right that's right that's right
B	those
C	mm
B	are the people who
C	mm
B	who'll who are not thinking that other people can sort me out and that
C	mm
B	yeah
C	you know that's the
B	yeah
C	see
C	erm
B	it's cos they're good
C	mm
B	my my friend erm
C	was was was he in the samba band?
B	he was he was an older fellow
C	right yes
B	erm
C	that wasn't
B	you're thinking with the rainbow hat?
B	that's actually
C	oh right
B	in my course
B	no he's not actually he's happily he's happily married
C	no he no there was there was one whose shoelace was undone and I kept wanting him to stop and I'd tie his shoelace for him but
B	oh
C	erm but if I saw
B	yeah he's
C	mm mm
B	recognise him
C	mm
B	and lovely lads by the sound of it
C	right right
B	and he wasn't actually
C	mm
B	still on friendly terms
C	yeah
B	erm and invited her along with him and she was asking him for money
C	mm
B	hard to
C	mm
B	erm
C	mm mm
B	even though the
C	mm
B	the kids and he sorted out
C	mm
B	really well with money and with
C	mm mm mm
B	you know the house and that kind of thing but
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	to
C	yeah
B	give you something or you've got that entitle thing that
C	that's right
B	for many years
C	and because
B	yeah
C	you know but erm
B	mm
C	but there was about forty-nine percent of women worked and fifty-one percent didn't
B	not like that here in Ireland even now
C	and and it gradually grew to where
B	yeah
C	it is now
B	yeah
C	you know where
B	yeah
C	erm
B	mm
C	you know er
B	but they'd still they're
C	mm mm mm
B	whereas it depends on your
C	mm
B	the circumstance but there er
C	yeah
B	or might get you would be mucking in as well so I think erm
C	mm
B	mm
C	erm
B	yeah because I mean I
C	mm
B	I mean I love not having to work
C	yeah
B	much
C	mm
B	easier for me to do it and I
C	mm
B	even though I'm not
C	mm
B	mindset in early on that she
C	oh
B	yeah she was spending money erm
C	mm
B	most
C	that's right that's right but erm
B	erm
C	mm
B	to that kind of
B	see that she has to do certain things you know
C	yeah
B	mm
C	erm
B	mm
C	this
B	yeah
C	you know?
B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	do you know what I mean that erm?
B	oh yeah
C	that means that they can't go out
B	oh yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	but actually working his way towards something and of course as the children grow older
B	yeah
C	they'll begin to say I want to do X Y and Z
B	yeah that's true
C	erm you know?
B	yeah that is true
C	mm
C	it will be interesting
B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
B	mm
C	for whatever the other one
B	yeah
C	whatever and whatever whatever it is
B	yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
C	as he's grown and he's grown stronger within himself
B	yeah
C	erm and he
B	yeah
