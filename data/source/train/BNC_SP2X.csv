C	so is it like an automatic transcription programme or something?
A	probably I don't know
C	so if I say phenomenological complexity
B	oh my god I had this thought about consciousness today
C	oh scary
B	on my run
C	oh
B	and it it's relation to existence
C	oh
B	well it was started off thinking about erm Descartes'
C	no I am having a conscious experience therefore I am
B	okay
C	that's my translation
B	so you can't if if and if you think of it as some sort of deduction right? okay let's just think of it as a deduction the existence claim has to be contained in the I think claim
C	correct
B	so there has to be sort of this affirmation of existence or
C	correct
B	I don't know I thought that was sort of I've never
C	but no this is this is old old news because there's been a huge debate about whether it is a whether it's a syllogism or a deduction
B	yeah yeah I know that I that's why I was saying take it as a syllogism but then that made me think of Brentano cos the way he explicates the aware
C	damn
B	I know I had a good sort of the way the way he explicates the awareness of awareness claim part of it is he thinks involves a judgement but judgement is either to affirm or deny the existence of something so contained in consciousness is an affirmation of existence
C	oh well I think that's like I think that's like
B	and I thought wow he probably got that from Descartes
C	well Descartes had a sort of struggle about whether it was a syllogism or not but
B	yeah
C	that
B	yeah I mean that's the hard
C	how who where did that come up?
B	anyway that was a good part of my run
C	anyway
B	but it made me think about you know how you have this
C	me?
B	self-sprung
C	oh yeah
B	stuff and I thought oh well maybe there's something I don't know something about that existence somehow
C	my latest paper is
B	I don't know
C	yeah
B	I just wanted to cos I totally forgot I was thinking of telling you about this and then I forgot when I got home cos you were having the crisis about the skip
C	that's our new crisis today skips
A	where's the skip?
B	it's the thing that you
A	yeah but where where do you got it? where do you put it?
C	it's got to be out there but you have to buy parking suspension and then that costs
A	everybody else in your neighbourhood uses it
B	yeah I mean they already use our garbage we're already the neighbourhood recycling centre
C	yeah they in our in our echo recycle bin they keep dropping we usually find some old fish and chips
B	well you know what though? I've noticed lately that they've only been putting recyclable items in there
C	no a little bit of
B	because I've taken them out the things that aren't recyclable and put them on the corner there
C	you have? oh
B	yes
C	vigilante? yeah although we have we have at least
B	because otherwise the recycle people have to do that right?
C	yeah they do so some
B	oh my god we saw a really bad one
C	oh yeah
A	yeah but that's the same you know cos
C	yeah
B	oh
A	couples coming down there to go and have have their
B	oh off the main road
C	yeah that's right I think they feel it's the kind of stage set out there and there aren't many people around so they have them there
B	yeah we saw a really terrible one
C	oh I think has
B	they had a fight they were screaming and the husband was running out the door and then running back to the door and screaming at her and they he came out around the corner and then this Muslim no
C	Somali kind of guy
B	Somali guy was coming round the corner
C	coming back with his shopping
B	and the husband just started punching him and I was watching out the window cos I'm nosy but I don't know what to do
C	yeah he was just letting out his anger at his but his domestic was like
B	but the
C	that was bad that's not a domestic that was just a piece of
B	a domestic gone bad
C	the guy was
B	he lost it
C	wow it was horrid
A	April about the twelfth?
C	oh after after Easter?
A	yeah
C	yeah so we're meant to be coming back on on Easter Sunday there's the you know there's the usual erm
A	I don't know

A	yeah where is that? is that in America or something?
C	might have been yeah so are you staying in

C	great cos
B	on the
C	yeah
B	we just thought oh we don't need to go in there and that's where the beer is
A	after all can you sell that?
C	yeah but I think it's some years old I think I don't know whether they're kind of decaying or not
A	I think you could set up a fairly good business of selling things that people like that are valuable but that people can't be bothered to sell
B	yeah
C	so what would be the?
A	so you like sell that and you take
C	people can be bothered to sell though because they can they can all do Ebay and
B	okay
C	I have no idea it's kind of impressive but yeah okay you want me to swizzle them?
A	bottle opener
B	oh
C	ah oh it's all happening it's all looking good how long have they been in?
B	erm I don't know thirty minutes or
C	they look mostly done
B	where is the bottle opener?

B	you can do you have a hot plate?
A	yeah it's a whole fully functioning kitchen like down the hallway
B	oh yeah
C	I had I was a veggie all my time at

B	isn't that funny you don't eat vegetables when you were younger
C	I mustn't have but I never ate in my own college once not one time
B	that is so annoying
C	so cos I was a scholar after a year I got a scholarship I had to go in and read say the prayer sometimes

B	oh my god
B	in Latin?
C	and then I just walked out yeah it was in Latin yeah but
B	do they still do that?
A	when when I I had to go to a half-way dinner erm a couple of weeks ago and I had like it's was a formal dinner and things like that they do some speech in Latin before you eat
B	that's probably the prayer
C	I don't know erm
B	wait say it again
A	we give we give thanks to erm

C	three quid or three fifty
A	I mean it's they're
B	wow
A	so who wants a meal like for two pounds? which is probably affordable

A	but the thing is also that you everybody in everybody in
C	oh
A	lots of people don't even use use the canteen
C	right
A	and it's like a hundred and forty pounds a term
C	right
A	and you're like well what's that? that's like if you add it all up it's a lot
C	yeah good point yeah
A	erm
C	so he did the
A	he did pay it yeah
C	what he just did it by sort of massive use of microwaves or?
A	well I think he got like a lot of people sort of got involved and helped and they used like lots of
C	so you had a kind of what do you call them in America? a bake out or a bake off
B	wow protest bake off
C	you had a I kind of I saw the I just remembered I've had a
B	really? what year was that?
C	probably nineteen seventy-two
B	yeah
C	they'd just invented them or something yeah I think only only places like restaurants had them or
B	I didn't grow up with a microwave
C	no no well my mum hasn't got one yet
A	I went to a really strange
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah quite fun actually
A	but it's it's it's feels like some sort of train station in from Tokyo in the nineties or something it's like it's super super weird and there's like I mean it's hard to explain you have to see it
C	yeah it's part of the museum is it?
A	yeah but it's like also it's kind of mixed with the it where they used to
B	yeah
A	and it's just like sort of weird colours and they've done all these weird things like it's kind of like a horror museum like a horror like things jump out of like
A	they had like a cooker attached to the ceiling and it's not sort of this thing would hop out of it
B	woah
C	a cuckoo?
A	a
B	a cooker
C	a cooker
A	and like there's all these like weird things going on like noises you can like watch adverts through and this is
B	oh yeah
C	well I think yeah
A	and it's not
C	yeah yeah apparently I'm the model of
A	and there's no one there you know?
B	these might
C	yeah there's lots of those interactive things in in the national
B	right mm those look pretty cooked
C	do they? yeah do you want to go on to the oh those are
B	those are definitely cooked
C	yeah we're good
B	so we'll turn this off I we should try the peas though

B	this is the I'm not sure how much to do
C	yeah you've got
A	I don't really I'm just going to eat a tiny bit of the fish seeing as I caught it
B	well you you can start with that and if you want more
C	that's pretty amazing though so how far out did you go?
A	not far cos it's sort of like it's a bit kind of quite a big tidal river saltwater
C	yeah
A	and it's another sort of
C	which what was the river called? which one is it?
A	no idea
C	I had to learn them all when I was a kid there was the Ouse and the Stour and the I have to check it is your computer on
B	no it's all the way upstairs
A	I can do it on my phone probably
C	the Orwell is it Orwell? I know Orwell George Orwell took his name from some place in around there his pen name Orwell cos his real name was Blair Eric Blair
A	well it says the river
C	oh oh
A	so basically if you see this
C	oh
A	this is
C	mm
A	this is where we were fishing
C	mm
A	this is the river but it's basically open sea kind of
C	go go in so I can see where it is in that's the bulge of East Anglia right?
A	whoops
C	oh look it's still is it still recording?
A	yeah erm where did maps go?
C	yeah yeah okay yeah

C	cool where of
B	I don't know if you should let them
C	oh there's
B	oh
C	whoo hoo cool
C	quite strange
A	weird very few people live there and
B	yeah
C	you know they're erm there are still people descended from the Dutch who who took flight from the Mongols in the thirteenth century because there's fear of
B	new salt
C	the
B	thanks
C	it seems to me
B	I haven't tried it yet
C	it's better than that
B	let's see
C	we must do it again sometime
B	what?
C	the nipping over to France
B	yeah that was pretty fun actually
A	did you go on the train?
B	we drove

C	which we did once with you
B	yeah
A	more than once I think
C	yeah?
B	we went on the ferry I remember going on the ferry and I remember going on the tunnel but
C	several times on the ferry
A	maybe I
B	yeah on and you went on the tunnel
C	yeah

A	erm which
C	that's cool in the troisieme arrondissement
B	so do you sort of speak French I mean cos you went through the?
A	I used to be a lot better
B	yeah
A	it's
B	to to speak
A	to try even try really
B	yeah
A	I'd rather like seem like a I don't know I
C	well it's amazing
B	yeah maybe it's even worse to try
C	it's really hard if you don't
B	they're sort of more ruthless than if you just
C	if you haven't had that sort of basic and you're just sitting in a classroom and hearing it wash over you gives you a kind of basic
B	yeah but he did do that
C	I know I know but it's much harder to
B	with those lessons yeah
C	to achieve kind of critical
A	yeah especially in Paris and stuff
B	yeah
C	and the French speak English much more than they used to and are probably hanging out with English people
B	does
C	no
B	so have you
A	I saw him briefly a few times but yeah
B	is he recovering from his break up?
A	probably I don't know
C	mm?
A	probably
C	oh so he's been back a few times?
A	mm he was back last weekend but I didn't I barely saw him
B	yeah he told us he was coming back but so that's when you said something about
C	oh you thought he meant for good?
B	yeah I thought it was his Easter break too but I don't think
C	he probably has a school week
A	he is finished like I think he's pretty much finished most of his sort of lectures and stuff
B	whoo
C	what?
B	hot mustard
C	oh
B	is really hot
C	yeah so so you don't know if
A	no I don't I mean like I doubt it

B	god last time we saw him he was in pretty bad shape
C	was he?
B	he had a really bad hangover cos he was hanging out with
C	oh god
A	you saw him after that as well?
B	she's a bad influence no yeah he just came why did he come by? he forgot something it was the
A	yeah I heard about that
C	binges hey oh well mm
B	no I don't know if it was binge or if he just
C	kept going
B	yeah
C	yeah it was really really uncool to drink at all when I was at uni
B	I didn't like drinking either
C	when I was eighteen but I mean we got a bit we kind of got into it near the end but relatively mildly alcohol was like street people and
B	oh yeah
C	are you going to get some money?
B	are you going to apply to summer travelling grant or?
A	I'm going to go to probably go to Greece for a bit erm
B	god you have like
B	a pretty amazing life
C	well part of it is like I mean you know in America?
B	yeah you just don't do that
C	going to Greece is like going from Colorado to Tennessee or something
B	oh yeah that's true that's the way things are here
A	but actually I
B	oh really?
A	they're all going to go there in the summer
B	you can come visit us next year cos we're going to have a big house
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah you must
B	so we were hoping people will come to visit
C	definitely
[ANNOTATION]	we will go to Greece next summer	Neutral
A	March
B	March
C	oh it doesn't
B	it was just ending or it's going on or
C	really?
B	yeah I read about it
C	does it get
B	well he would be on break
A	mm
B	maybe not quite
[ANNOTATION]	next year i will go to Greece	Entailment
A	just the end
C	is it now
B	yeah just I think it's either just finished or
C	oh I didn't know anyway cos now I know that Austin is number two city for gays in America San Francisco
[ANNOTATION]	San Francisco is number one city for gays	Neutral
B	just gays or?
C	it has the third highest percentage
B	it is good where did you get it? did you get it from a wine shop?
A	there's this thing in
C	it's really I
A	I mean it might if you take the bottle it's like five fifty to fill it up
B	oh really?
A	and the bottle is like three quid if you don't
C	oh well that's not cheap
[ANNOTATION]	the bottle is cheap	Contradiction
B	well that's a good idea so we can take it
A	five fifty?
C	five fifty for a bottle of wine I mean that's fine but it's not cheap
A	five pounds fifty?
B	even even
C	oh my god
A	five pounds fifty is really cheap
C	it's pretty well yeah it's not but
A	you can't even get a bottle of wine in an off-licence that isn't Echo Falls for five quid
C	probably true I'd say
[ANNOTATION]	the bottle is on sale	Neutral
A	but even so like even like I don't like there's I know the secret off-licence brands that if you can buy it are cheap but they're still like six pounds you know?
C	you know when we go to Sainsbury's?
A	that's probably less though than a full bottle I think
C	erm no it
B	have some salad
C	you know sometimes you go to Sainsbury's and there's some two pounds off and it's
B	we used to drink really cheap wine from Sainsbury's like two pounds a bottle
[ANNOTATION]	Sainsbury's sold cheap wine	Entailment
C	I don't remember
B	we went we just in France we bought ninety-six bottles of wine
C	that's right
B	it was fun
C	fun quite but the most expensive one we bought was like six fifty I think
A	well when I went to Paris all I did was
C	babe are you still itching all the time?
A	mm not really
C	mm
A	what I do in Paris is go to the best restaurants in Paris
C	mm
A	oh can you? yeah
B	such a good idea
A	cos er me and
C	I don't think I've ever been to a posh restaurant
B	so nice
A	and they don't well they don't even like you don't have to order anything you just sit there
B	yeah and they just bring you food
A	for like hours
C	how do we get in on this?
B	oh
C	one day
B	you have to erm
C	give us a bell
B	we have we're not foodies so we have to be hooked in
C	no we're not no but
B	or pay money
A	I'm not a foodie either I don't I don't know what half the stuff they bring me is
B	yeah it's probably a good thing
C	it's probably like grilled testicles and
A	yeah I know I was I said I was I was eating I had never eaten it before but it was that thing sweetbread
C	yeah brain
B	what is that?
A	yeah it's brain or something and anyway I was like to my friend I said is this pork or octopus?
B	mm
A	cos it looks like it's looks like an octopus tastes a bit like fatty pork
C	not that I ate a lot of that when I was a kid cos
B	you did?
C	well it was we were it was cheap it was really cheap
A	I thought it was like this bit
C	no the you can the sweetbread is the brain that's all
A	I thought it was like a bit in the neck
C	no but I told I was giving some
B	ah
C	they're made of meat consciousness is meat
B	yeah
C	or something
B	you should tell your American students that because
C	I did tell some audience the other day I cos I'm trying to tell them
B	that would be a
C	actually it was perfectly nice if you dice it up and fry it with garlic mm
B	there's lot there's a lot more food
C	I know he wants another
A	yeah
B	the
A	and more rice rice and beans
C	it was good but there was only five so one for him and
B	that's fine
C	two-thirds for us
B	there were only five in there?
C	yeah should have bought more I just didn't know
B	we did did we only buy one pack?
C	I bought two packs but I only unfroze one cos we were having the others
B	oh
C	okay yeah we need rice do you want some more rice?
A	yes please
C	actually you know what I should swizzle the rice with
B	mm
C	so hang on not too much cos it's
B	there are glasses over there
C	what?
B	nothing
C	it is it's really it's really it's not bullshit it's not
B	mm
C	yeah no there was a movement I remember back in the eighties or nineties this is like
B	yeah I'll have some
C	where they thought they'd set up these shops with these big steel vats with wine in and then people would just come in and fill up like that
A	that's exactly what that is that shop is though
C	was it steel vats?
A	yeah
B	we should go there
C	yeah well there you are so somebody has imported the concept
B	just take this to the
C	yeah but
B	have it
C	cheaper to have a booze cruise
B	I know
C	yeah you get the slightest
B	now we can have a
C	there's more English ones too
A	ninety-six bottles of wine
B	oh wait so what are you going to do for the summer?
A	erm I don't know go to Greece with
C	Greece
B	yeah
C	wow
B	she wants to buy a house in
A	or something yeah but
C	good grief
B	god I wonder if
A	so she's looking at it and she thinks she can get it for the amount of money
C	two a penny
B	yeah very good time
C	cos she hasn't really it's not really an investment for her she just wants to have somewhere to go but you can get she has like a bigger sort of like bar on the beach has a pool table and stuff and it's like seven thousand
C	quid? jeez
A	euros yeah
C	euros
B	I wonder though you know what? I wonder what's going to happen if they leave the eurozone it'll probably get even cheaper
C	it doesn't matter no maybe not necessarily
B	really?
C	I mean that's so cheap it's ridiculous
B	yeah sure
A	I think Athens is going to be like Berlin or something cos when I was there just for one say last summer it just seemed really sort of cool and like happy
C	cool
A	a lot of young people there
C	hey babe what about this? did you heat this up?
B	no I forgot
C	well would you like a normal sausage
A	mm
B	I'll have half a one my nose is burning what about the peas? shall we have some more peas?
C	want more peas? yeah you do peas you're the pea
B	so but the thing is how do you
C	but sometimes
B	you have to get one that you could shut down really safely you know while you're not there right?
C	well
A	yeah but I mean it's not I don't know if it's like gonna have to be that sort of
A	yes please lots of people go sort of they get their house abroad and they put a lot of stuff that they really care about in there and stuff you can like make in really nice you know luxury and like
B	yeah
C	yeah maybe not that
B	yeah
C	but they only the key thing there is you've got to have some local
B	that kind of
C	who can maybe kind of live there when you're not there and deal with all the
B	or at least
A	yeah
C	I mean we went far from there when we were in Turkey but
A	it's quite hard when you can't drive
B	oh yeah you need to get your licence
A	yeah like
B	yeah and just it's pretty can
C	it's fun driving
B	you should maybe you should try to do that this summer
A	yeah probably
B	just read the book
B	basically and then
C	what you really need does
A	no
C	no because that's the way that's how I did it I just had a girlfriend with a car
B	no but you can rent a car
A	her flatmate might buy one
C	what? buy a car?
A	yeah cos he just sold his restaurant so he's like
C	who did?
A	like her flatmate her friends
C	oh
A	she she lives with this couple that like ran a restaurant in
C	what are they going to do now?
A	open a bar in Austin or something
B	so did they sell it as with the name and all the?
A	no they just sold their lease and like it's sort of
B	and it's in
A	yeah
C	do you know how hot Austin is?
A	yeah
B	it's frigging hot in the summer
A	he's
C	oh
B	oh so he's
C	there's quite a lot of Aussies in Austin yeah there's one really what's that place we liked? the French Bakery or something what's it called?
B	yeah it's not the French Bakery but something like it
C	it was just called something like
B	yeah it was very simple
C	it's really nice it's basically a big bread shop but it has a restaurant as well last time we went they gave us this massive

C	yeah kippers
B	no I wasn't kippers they're not I mean what was that fish we had that
C	that was that was
B	in in Antwerp?
C	that was erm pickled mackerel it was
B	the
C	yeah
B	er
C	yeah it just wasn't well done I think actually I don't think it was
B	oh oh
A	it sounds good to me
B	I thought we both we looked at each other we both had the same reaction thank god it was
C	yeah well I'm a real wimp you know I don't like shellfish and
B	oysters
C	sea
A	that's the place that place in Essex we went to is famous for oysters that's what people go there to do
C	I don't like the chewy or is that mussels?
B	I don't like it's kind of slimy
A	you don't chew oysters
B	no just like they go right down your throat
C	what do you do?
A	if you're chewing it you do that's like it's really disgusting if you chew it obviously
B	it's an oyster shooter
C	so what is what is the taste but then there's no taste is there?
A	no no there is you just you swallow it and then it's like get
B	it slides down your throat
A	and it's like getting hit in the face with a wave or something but refreshing you know?
B	I've only done it once I can't remember
C	done what once?
B	an oyster shooter
A	shooter
B	that's what they call them we say oyster shooter I was at some
C	in the United States
B	yeah at a Boxing Day party and they had oyster shooters I swear that's what they called them and you just
A	in the shell?
C	what is it though?
B	yeah
A	yeah that's you kind of
B	it was disgusting
A	just you spray lemon on it and Tabasco and pepper
C	is it still alive or something?
A	no
B	no god that would be really something
C	well that was really nice
B	yeah
C	you're meant to have a merguez cruise go and stock up on organic you know
B	yeah just have a have a meat cruise you know
C	yeah if you get a day return it probably pays for itself if you buy two
B	or you could just spend the night
C	yeah you could
B	yeah true and where would we go?
C	well I my my theory
B	that place we went?
C	my theory is that you get away from Calais
B	yeah
C	because Calais is just designed to sell stuff
B	yeah we only had to drive an hour away we were already
C	yeah indeed that's right
B	ah
C	ah that was good
C	oh I moved it
A	can I have another bit of bread or?
C	yeah you can you can have our final oh what is happening tomorrow? oh we'll get the car if it doesn't blow up again four hundred quid on the car five hundred quid on the skip
A	the skip is expensive
A	that's insane
C	well the thing is I've I've got a permit for four weeks
B	oh
C	but
B	mm
C	I don't suppose it's expensive in
A	all every single council is running schemes they're all corrupt and like crooked because they had to make this money because the government have pulled it out from under their feet a bit
B	oh really?
A	so they're really just like selling off everything and like
B	oh maybe like that's why they
A	the long-term repercussions of stripping those councils of their money is going to be like it's going to bad because
B	well they want to become their own governments but we saw that cities want to become their own governments
A	but not sort of boroughs
B	no
C	oh yeah yeah this is like well well London boroughs of course have got more people in them than most cities but yeah I doubt it's so
B	it's true
C	and it looks like the kind of surge in interest in cricket is dropping away now
B	well we haven't been watching it
A	that's cos that's cos England are so crap
C	it's just hysteria
B	who did they lose to? Sri Lanka?
A	no Bangladesh
B	mm well good for Bangladesh and what happened to them did they?
A	they got knocked out
C	they were knocked out
A	in the in a tournament that's basically designed to make it impossible for that to happen
B	so was has the final been played?
C	no
B	is it's Australia versus New Zealand?
C	no I think there's still some
A	New Zealand's in the final and Australia play India tonight for the other final spot
B	oh I hope India wins
A	no I hope Australia wins
B	right mm
A	and then they're gonna lose in the final
C	oh yeah
B	yeah I'd I'd like to see New Zealand win
C	New Zealand oh yeah you know the pleasure that would give the New Zealanders would be like worth everything
B	yeah
C	it's such a shame I kind of knew that would happen
B	what?
C	we got to the top and then
A	the thing about it is that it's not even the team it's just sort of people like there's like people in sort of the executive positions in the ECB this guy Paul Downton who fired Pietersen and like had all these sort of big ideas but he's totally removed from
C	it's exactly
B	oh yeah
C	it's like the health service the police and universities
A	yeah and trains
B	yeah
C	layers and layers of
B	removed bureaucrats
C	of admin yeah cost and they all have you know like SUVs you know and all the bull old it's disgusting it's like with the decline and fall of the Roman empire
B	who is it?
A	I read a really good piece about problems in universities today
C	oh
A	I can't remember who wrote it
C	Marina Warner yeah in the LRB I was reading that yeah I she's okay
A	I thought it was a good piece anyway
C	it was a good piece I read most of it
B	what was she saying? what's the problem?
C	just described how how grotesque it is and she's always been a freelance but she's been working in I think Essex and these guys just come along telling you what to do and
A	well everything has sort of become
B	yeah yeah
C	that's right and I've seen programmes on the NHS how they've done that and on the police they've applied this model that doesn't work
B	the business model
C	all these all these institutions had their own perfectly reasonable things that worked and they've all been fucked by bureaucrats in Whitehall
B	Whitehall
C	well we say Whitehall it's kind of the generic term for
B	for government?
C	yeah I mean
B	yeah
C	no there have been a series but there might be how come you saw that online?
A	I just picked it up today when I was
C	Marina Warner god bit of a slag no she's she's nice but she's very sort of she's always written about she was Martin Amis' girlfriend once and then do you remember a time she suddenly started coming to
C	she took up with some guy at the end of
B	no I don't must have not been me
C	well I interviewed her
B	I remember there was someone that came and took a bench
C	some some sweetheart no no that was

C	well erm not really I mean I thought we were going to eat this
B	yeah
A	I don't actually I don't really eat eat any of any of the cakes
C	so what are you going to do when you grow up
A	I don't know
B	when you grow up?
C	I mean
B	he's only he's only finishing his second year you know
C	I know but
A	you can't start asking him that
C	I just went on to graduate cos it was two years' free money I didn't have any further motive

B	he didn't go to that many restaurants though
A	I was only there for three days four days
C	right
A	but it was the same when we were in New York with this guy he took us like to some crazy one
B	really?
C	what about Noma in Copenhagen you've got to go there

B	yeah put them on the street somebody would eat it
A	this is
B	oh yeah
A	erm which is like where she sells them

B	yeah
A	and sort of like they were like always sweating with the effort of what they were doing and they were like super super strong
C	they were a kind of crack team
A	yeah

B	oh so you're like what did he intend or what's the?
A	no not necessarily what you know like it's sort of
C	no on the contrary what do I feel?
B	oh what does the audience take from this?
A	no but it's
C	yeah I actually
A	what did Cavafy does with that stuff is just so interesting I think
A	yeah
B	who?
A	all all his poems about sort of
C	right
A	you know he cos he obviously had a real he was engaged with them all the all the time and it shaped the way he worked I'll tell you what I'm I'm not interested in reception of other people from the classics rather that like
C	yeah I mean
A	I'm interested in Cavafy so I'm interested in how he responds to it
C	right
A	rather than
C	yeah I mean in one way it's complete erm
A	and like you know writers
C	erm yeah I
A	who is like I think like
C	oh
B	who?
A	Anne Carson
C	who is she?
B	I don't know I haven't read any of her
A	a poet and and a classicist
B	wow
C	right yeah I mean there was a there was a movement and I don't know when where they talked about the intentional fallacy
B	yeah
C	and that was meant to be the fallacy of trying to recover the author's intentions
B	mm Roland Barthes
C	and this was thought to be a really bad idea but actually I'm not I was sort of quite old-fashioned about that and then then Philip Larkin said when I write a poem erm I like to make a slot machine into which the reader I'm almost quoting him inserts depending on his attention
B	yeah
C	his picture is he really gets out exactly what he felt so that's the classic old picture
B	oh so the reader gets exactly what Philip Larkin felt
C	what you do you want yeah yeah whereas the extreme reader response people say we don't give a fuck what the author meant it's just what I feel when I read it
B	yeah but that's so weird because
C	that's the two extremes right erm
B	yeah
A	there's
C	yeah that's is that part of what you want to do your dissertation on?
A	well I don't know that's like what I'm interested in rather than
C	yeah no I think well that's
A	it's like if you read sort of the Alice Oswald one is really good to look at cos it's
C	whose is it?
A	Alice Oswald called Memorial
C	oh is it the Cavafy translation?
A	kind of yeah but it's it's basically every sort of it's every single death in the Iliad
C	oh I've heard of this it's really
A	sort of one on top of the other
C	this rings a bell
A	and all the similes are repeated sort of verbatim twice
C	oh that's erm oh yeah
A	and like sort of
C	have you told me about it?
A	maybe but it's like really
C	Alice Oswald
A	sort of such good what I think about it it's such good sort of contemporary writing and poetry that makes it and it stems from people who are sort of deeply involved in the classics
C	right
A	that's why I think it's interesting
B	mm so what it what it causes yeah?
A	like what is it about the what is it about the classics that
C	she's pretty cool Alice Alice Oswald she is pretty cool
A	and that's the same with Anne Carson
C	woah she is cool erm yeah so it's like
B	and do you think that there's something particular about the classics or is it some kind of just conveying a human?
A	well I think it I I I don't think it can't even just with something as simple as the way someone uses language I don't think that I don't I can't see how I can't see how it cannot sort of affect the way you use English as a writer if you've really properly learnt Latin and Greek
B	mm right
A	and like done translating
B	yeah
C	maybe she was at
B	right
C	erm cool
A	and sort of cos
B	mm
A	you're trying to it's all the all you really have is books and it's not really things that kind of are strictly cerebral either you want to sort of be aware in a more immediate sense
B	yeah right
A	and then you like have your like imagination engaged and sort of to erm linguistic faculties engaged
B	right
A	all the time as a a classicist
B	yeah
C	I think there's something translated
B	but that that's going to be true I mean that's going to be true for any translation that you're doing
A	yeah
B	so
A	root languages
B	yeah yeah
C	mm
B	I mean it's an interesting question just in general about the relationship between language and thought so erm Hungarian for example has a really weird grammatical structure so their thinking process is supposed to be especially great for mathematics for example
A	right
C	yeah
B	which is kind of a but that is an interesting that's an interesting question in itself that's got to be part of it
A	yeah but then
B	part of the
A	yeah but then
B	how did Greek
C	is this you're talking about Hungarian?
B	yeah
C	yeah I was talking to
B	yeah but
C	she suggested that it's because of that
B	pff oh
C	she's Jewish herself but she was sort of saying well it's not the genius of the Hungarian language it's just that
B	well if there's if there's one
C	I think it I
B	I mean I guess if they're all Jewish then that would be sort of a question
C	they're not all but mostly yeah that could go that
A	like Hungarian Hungarian chess champions
B	right
C	it is yeah that's right it is it could be true cos apparently
A	Russian
B	yeah
C	apparently Hungarian is uniquely free in kind of word order or something
B	is it what is it related to any other language I mean?
C	yeah it's related to Finnish and it's a
B	anyway I think that would be
C	it's not at all like Romance languages or Semitic languages
B	yeah
C	anyway
B	sounds like a good question I mean you don't I don't know
A	I've got a friend in
B	yeah
A	in in Hungary you know I I thought it was I found it interesting she asked people from like who learn different languages what how animals talk in that language an English frogs say ribbit ribbit ribbit
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and in Hungarian they go ra ca ca
B	that does kind of sound like a
A	ra ca ca ra ca ca
C	yeah and in in Aristophanes they go croax croax or something don't they somehow
B	that is so funny but both sound but ribbit does that? yeah they kind of go
C	exactly the same in America
C	well cos frogs do different things don't they?
B	yeah
C	I bet you that this Alice her her surname must her maiden name must be different she took her husband's name yeah she must she must have been doing classics when I was teaching
A	that that and they should if you should get a chance to read to read Anne Carson
C	yeah I will I like
B	do you ever read the sort of a Greek sentence and think erm that's something some thought particular to that language that you wouldn't really think in English or it strikes you as or maybe just lose that in translation? I don't know
A	I think that well if you're doing I mean I
B	yeah yeah
A	that you can't get in translation
B	ah yeah yeah that's good jokes yeah good example
C	well actually it's funny I feel partly feel the opposite where I what I loved about Aristophanes is he's just bloody fun in the idea that you can laugh
B	that a human can translate
C	you can laugh across two-and-a-half thousand years is I find that really moving
A	it's not that funny though I this Aristophanes
C	well it is pretty funny
A	I actually just wrote an essay about Aristophanes about
C	well I haven't read enough but I just think there are things
A	yeah I really like the jokes about farting
C	exactly exactly but that's cool people are laughing about that in
A	there is a that's the thing that's not the funniest stuff in Aristophanes
C	yeah but also the women saying well we won't let our men have sex with us unless they stop fighting
A	yeah
C	that's funny
B	unless they stop fighting?
A	the funniest
B	or stop farting?
C	fighting
B	oh
A	I think the funniest things in Aristophanes is the is the things that we can't find funny
B	oh
A	cos we're not there
C	so my
B	your reception is fucked up
C	so what? give me an example
A	well it's hard to explain like it's sort of she talks about all this like nuanced stuff you know how the funniest things are the things that kind of dip under
C	oh yeah that's true that's true so
A	you know when you I
C	I see this all
A	I did the supervision with
C	yes you do you know what triggered it?
A	yeah but you know when you're you're like
C	oh well that sounds like sort of mystical illumination
A	no you well I I
C	well that's different
A	you know I you don't you don't always know you're laughing uncontrollably
B	yeah I haven't done that for a long time
C	yeah but it's usually something sets you off
B	then but then you start laughing and then you're just like I don't know why I'm laughing and you're like laughing
C	oh
A	he said there are two he said there were two people who were famous for never having laughed it Plato and Jesus
A	and maybe the next one is
C	two people famous for doing what?
A	for never having really laughed
C	oh no no I've laughed
B	Plato Jesus and
C	no I've laughed a lot that's stupid I know people who don't have a sense of humour there are people
A	but that's the point of being a a sort of the thing about epistemology these are the two figures that you would not expect to be epistemologically free ever
C	so and you mean so and they didn't laugh so that proves that's
A	not it's not obviously it's not a proof it's just a sort of sort
B	observations
C	we don't know about we don't know about Jesus
A	obviously we don't no one knows that
C	cos you know you know all we ever got from about Jesus was all the kind of
B	yeah it's true we don't what do we know about Jesus
C	well yeah we just get the we get the story afterwards and
B	he must have been a pretty serious guy though I mean
C	I don't know I don't know
C	he he knows what's funny he can tell stories he can tell jokes well but he doesn't himself naturally spontaneously laugh I mean he does he's not like some people who can't even get
B	yeah
C	but most you know I when I watch often on telly I watch things I don't know why it's funny cos I don't know it's some TV person I don't know what the reference is erm but most of the there's there's a lot of theorising about what what humour is it's really it's really hard one of the things we know is the kind of incongruity sort of when the when the posh when the really pound posh person sits on the banana skin and that's part of it
A	yeah and I mean British people have a particular sense of humour which is
C	oh we do
A	yeah very strange to Americans
C	yeah
A	you're silly
C	yeah yeah we do silly
B	like really stupid silly that Americans just
C	they they do though they do in those TV programmes
A	like Bill and Ted
C	more and more
B	yeah Bill and Ted yeah that's true but that's
A	Wayne's World
B	it's hard to yeah it's hard to
C	it's very hard to talk about
B	it's
A	also it's really interesting about Aristophanes in sort of context of the Greater Dionysian and it's sort of state sponsored state sanctions all like this act of sort of being in a citizen is to laugh at this thing if you don't laugh you're not one of us
C	oh my god
B	yeah that's hard
A	so I didn't I was a bit sort of deadly serious
C	oh my god
A	undertones
B	yeah
C	I mean no but tell me I'm
A	well yeah it's kind of to understand any sort of Greek drama you really have to understand the context that they're performed in which is a really like grand public ceremony put on by the state where you have all these rituals before
C	always?
A	yeah there's two main ones the Lenaia which is just just it's before the before the weather's alright to sail so it's just Greeks and the Great Dionysia which is sort of the whole Greek world
C	the Great?
A	Dionysia
C	Dionysia
A	and then you have you know you have things like at the Great Dionysia you have a sort of parade of the war orphans of that year you have all the
C	right
A	parade the tributes from the Empire and then you watch some fucking Euripides
C	I had no idea but Euripides is not funny is it?
A	yeah but I know but but you went in and then you did that for four days and you do one day of of comedy at the end
C	it's tragedy
B	it's all very rigid it's sort of
A	it's you have to
B	time for comedy
A	it's sort of the idea as citizen as
C	catharsis
A	as spectator you got it's a performance of roles and and the and the
C	was was it always like that? couldn't you just go to the theatre or something?
A	no that was when you watched it
B	there was no side off Broadway
C	jeez I am so ignorant
A	there was no sort of there was no no sort of theatre as a there's no theatre as a as a erm leisure activity
C	that's it
A	when just a sole entertainment
C	what a
A	that's the thing that's why it that's why it's
B	oh so he had a way of being humorous maybe in that context
C	so he's
A	yeah
C	yeah but aren't they?
A	yeah but if you look at
B	well
A	you know like plays like sort of the Ion and stuff they all kind of almost like sort of Greek
C	yeah it's gonna be your your phone is going to break down it's like autochthonous shit
B	so
A	well that's the thing there's there's there's satire plays
B	but they're they're not part of this whole parade of
A	they're
B	is there any non-parade humour?
A	non what?
C	jeez
B	like sort of this that's not part of this state-sanctioned erm I don't know
C	I need a I think I need a one O one on this I need a book about
A	I mean there there might be there's probably like sort of things like they had in Rome like sort of pantomime and stuff that were going on but not really like grand like things like Aristophanes and Euripides are sort of really just like not you don't you only get that at these at these festivals
B	even yeah
A	well that's the thing this is this theatre this stage was sort of one place where you can be subversive cos it was sort of so heavily contained that it was alright to be
B	oh yeah
A	that's part of democracy sort of testing itself
B	right
A	that's how people like to look at it
C	so I'm just reading about it then
A	that sounds like that sounds ridiculous but to us
C	were they like huge
B	the phalli
C	the
A	it seems very funny like it's their you know long male they're tied on everyone's walking around them
C	how big are they like?
A	three foot long
C	that's pretty cool I think the Muslims should take that up sorry shouldn't have said that
C	er and then come the girls carrying baskets and then come the
B	so do you have to pick a a particular advisor for your dissertation?
A	yeah probably
C	well yeah I mean it's
A	I can't I want to do one I want to do one
B	mm
C	right Aristophanes parodied the rural Dionysia in
A	in in Arcadians that's one I did the that's one of my set texts this year
C	oh cool
A	which I did the essay on
C	go well
B	I know I cannot I cannot keep up with
C	and we know I know I knew what the word tragedy means goat song so they say
A	yeah and then
C	which means?
A	which is erm from the
C	trellis oh the faeces?
B	oh right right
A	basically it's like a wine song but it takes obviously pun on it and it's in the Arcanes there is a really good bit with Euripides in it sort of borrowing costumes from his plays and he's like he kind of points to how contrived tragedy is as a sort of
C	so is the comedy that he started from four eight seven BC that's when we first started having comedy as well as tragedies is there one there? mm
B	yeah I mean that's what's wrong with it
C	can be beautiful or funny
B	right
C	on their own as it were but so and you just have to balance appreciating context and
A	yeah I mean there's either and then there's like there's been a symposium and they afterwards they go on about us sort of what they and then quote bits of the play
C	in the symposium?
C	right
A	at the at the symposium reciting it cos they had those kind of memories
C	yeah because you didn't have
A	and you then you take it out of the civic arena and appreciate it which isn't like I haven't really read any of the
B	but that would be that's a kind of interesting question
C	how much poetry was there written independently of?
A	well all the lyric
C	yeah quite so they're just they have they're not so so context-bound in the same way except that they sit in the literary traditions in
B	I said I can't keep up with
C	no no but I am kind of but I'm actually just really know nothing about this probably cos I stopped learning Latin Greek when I was fourteen or fifteen
A	anyway I thought Cavafy was a sort of like old sort of sort of thing that Anne Carson and Alice Oswald
C	I definitely want to check that out
B	I'll have to look up this person
C	yeah yeah
A	there's also
C	ah yeah yeah the cryptology before
A	cos he's a
C	who's this?
A	erm
C	oh right right right in
A	I like that book except when he's
C	he he is a bit poncey
A	yeah
C	he's a bit
A	he's a bit what he's really good at though is sort of just describing characters for like a page
C	mm wow
A	and they're really sort of
C	god yeah I haven't
B	can I see that?
C	I read a number of I used to love his brother cos his brother was a natural history writer his the family the Durrell family moved to Corfu when
B	oh really?
C	when Gerald Durrell was a kid and he was just amazing that this English family and he wrote a lovely book called My Family and Other Animals about being transplanted out of grey old England to Corfu at the age of nine
A	so that's the first one
C	what?
A	that's the first one
C	is it?
A	Justine
C	Justine Justine was name Marquis de Sade's girl
A	I'm thinking what's the best thing to read for Anne Carson first is
C	the first of what?
A	Anne Carson
C	what to read first?
B	oh is this a library book that you checked out yeah?
A	yeah
B	which is? oh that
A	that's something else
C	yeah it would be nice I would like it it would be nice if the Greek
A	yeah I want the Greek too
C	yeah
A	he sort of like in the introduction saying really interesting things
C	are these his translations as well?
A	yeah they're not that good but they're really like you get a sense of cos he does one thing at sort of like expense and then
C	yes
A	which borrowed a lot on classical
C	still?
A	well that's
C	well that's like Arab like Arab countries yeah
A	and then Cavafy sort of shifts between like those two to you know to indicate points
B	mm
A	so he uses lots of like awkward words that's just an indication
C	oh I see
B	was that unusual to shift between the two?
A	I think Cavafy might have started it he's sort of a modernist and like
B	yeah
C	cool have you ever heard of erm Pessoa? Fernando Pessoa? he's one of my he is so weird he has they're not they're not pseudonyms he calls them heteronyms and they're kind of he's this Portuguese weirdo
B	oh my god I remember you reading reading his poetry or
C	yeah I read a lot of it because he's he's kind of a very episodic person in in
B	what's his name again?
C	Pessoa which just means person in Portuguese when you were I think early on when they you and I were
B	oh my god yes
C	amazing old
B	we snuck away from you guys
C	yeah we snuck away and then said oh coffee and just get these little espressos and it's just like
B	yeah yeah I remember that
C	three old guys in suits at eight o'clock in the morning well you should check out a check out Pessoa before you go to Portugal erm one of his one of his
B	his own person
C	what? after what?
B	did you say his own person?
C	yeah I think he writes if you the poems he writes under his own name are the least good ones
B	that that yeah I'm glad you related that to what we were talking about cos when you first mentioned it I thought wow that's a real lateral jump
C	no it's just
B	but then you
C	no I'll tell you what it was I was just looking at I started reading a poem in here and it somehow reminded me of Pessoa
B	yeah
C	maybe partly
A	yeah a bit
B	what's the book the best book to begin with to your favourite author?
A	I only read one and I can't even remember which number it was
A	probably I think it might be I think one three and four are famous
C	Lucretius? he's basically right I mean he got a lot of stuff right
A	is that the guy that said you shouldn't fear death? no no
C	yeah no he did say that
A	yeah that's the bit I read
C	erm death is nothing
A	you shouldn't fear death
B	you shouldn't fear death cos you won't be here
A	yeah Ian Ian McEwan wrote to me he says he's pretty into that but he was he got that from Epicurus
B	oh right yeah that's not I'm thinking of Epicurus
A	although it's actually an interesting question how much it is he is a sort of
B	why doesn't he think people should write poetry?
C	oh and like
A	can't remember I don't know
C	oh
B	cos it's annoying poetry is annoying
A	you don't get you don't get you don't get The Swerve anywhere else
C	oh? no you know The Swerve
A	I think
C	like all the atoms have all the atoms are like going along in straight lines none of them ever bump into each other so how does how did the world begin and?
B	oh yeah
C	and at one point one of them went
C	it swerved
B	no electrons are collapsing
C	that's how you get everything yeah
A	yeah
C	but then some people think that's how you get free will and blah blah blah
B	oh The Swerve?
C	cool
A	and once one does it once then it's like chaos
C	yeah and then everything ran off
A	it all swerves in and parallels lines
B	why would you think that they're all going in straight lines to begin with?
A	I don't know er very good question but yeah so that could be literary and
B	I mean like
A	well the question is
B	it could easily
A	I think I mean I was like I sort of cos like I think it all sort of comes from like Epicureans and the Stoics arguing about things like how can you how can you know a certain thing?
B	yeah
A	like you can just say well you you can if you see it therefore it's there
B	yeah
A	and the Stoics were like well no
C	no
A	they're like well if you see something from a distance or like a stick in the water it's like a swerve man
B	right yeah but
A	yeah but it makes sense going backwards I guess in their arguments
B	yeah
C	I don't know what you could do
B	it is it is actually I think
C	yeah it is but erm it's
B	maybe it's not the best of that I mean
C	well it's not you might think that wasn't literary enough
B	oh well there
C	you want something literary but with an philosophical side
A	it's like there's there's a girl in the year above and her her dissertation on sort of like regret in Seneca
C	oh oh yeah
B	that sounds like a good one
C	that's a good one
A	yeah
C	Seneca is so rich
B	regret is a good topic too
C	or Plutarch what?
B	regret is a good topic I think
C	I've got a huge great fat book called Regret so when I was at
B	well apparently they did a lot of interviews of old people recently and what they regret is not what they did but what they didn't do
C	oh yes yeah you said that years ago you said
B	yeah where are you going?
A	beer somewhere?
B	beer yeah
C	oh yeah so I thought you that was you when I I first kind of first met you you thought that that's what people would
B	yeah and then
C	I don't think I regret what I mean I
B	you don't regret what you do
C	no I don't think I
B	maybe you're not do you regret anything?
B	that may answer that question
C	well you know the famous French
B	what's that?
C	that's the great the most famous French song ever by Edith Piaf I won't sing it
B	oh
C	you know
B	I don't think it's true that you I do regret some of the things I've done I think
C	you know she says
B	I dunno
C	erm well it's really
A	well I think if you think about old people like now that when they were young it was like all you couldn't do anything
A	you know what I mean?
C	compared to
B	like it's not as restrictive now
C	so you were
A	they have lived their whole life sort of trying to behave properly and they're way much more
C	well oh so now you don't have to bother
A	no
B	no I don't I bet you don't I bet I think that's a good point there
C	no there's been a there's been a sort of shattering increase of opportunity not just
B	yeah but also sort of I mean that's what the sixties were about right?
C	yeah
B	think about the difference between the fifties and the sixties
C	yeah that's incredible
B	and now anything goes anything
C	no but you see the thing about so you know I you know there was really particularly bad time when I went round and er
B	having a hard time
C	had left and it was erm you know he was sobbing and I just felt
B	regret?
C	so terrible and yeah and but do I regret it? I it's difficult I can't really make sense of regret because it's so locked in with the cause
B	yeah it's hard that's why I was to say
C	the whole pattern of your life it's cos you think if I hadn't done that well then that wouldn't have happened there wouldn't be
B	It's hard to say I think that's why people I think that's why people don't regret what they did do it cos they realise that
C	it's all locked in
B	it's all you can't sort of subtract some piece and say
C	well here's a I've just read a good one so this guy yeah the guy who
B	oh
C	one hour to talk to her now that's
B	yeah
C	that's pretty powerful
B	yeah and that's also something that's
C	and so
B	it's it's an isolated something you can isolate like you can
C	yeah it's a very sort of pure case
B	yeah
C	so you've got that kind of case
B	yeah and I can see that I think a lot of
A	what
C	no just just he just regrets
B	not having one
C	he couldn't say goodbye he couldn't have
A	but that's nothing to
C	oh well er no wait wait wait regret doesn't there's remorse which is when you feel bad about something
B	yeah it's not that
C	you can regret things that and have got no moral so like you might have met so-and-so
B	yeah
C	but they were going to come but they didn't so you can regret something completely morally neutral is that?
B	that's true
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	that's true
C	yeah so there's a big difference between
B	yeah
C	regret and remorse so
B	but I
C	but these these are things like you know I they might regret oh I never went scuba diving or something
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	but I think you know sort of when I think about sometimes I worry that I'm going to regret not doing X
C	do you? I never
B	yeah I'm going to regret not talking to my mum more
A	yeah and that's the that's the reason that and you and then you do it
B	yeah
C	it then
B	it motivates me to do it
A	kind of like when
B	yeah
C	but I can't it's not really the best motive is it?
B	no it's not no I think it's not
C	you ought to be doing it because it's good to do or
B	no it's but I but I think I
C	yeah that's
B	and but I know it's the I it would be a good thing
C	that's I don't I don't have that I just don't have it I'm not thinking well I should do this because I know that in future I will wish that I had done it no
A	I that's why I did that my
C	yeah that's yeah that's not I'm going to look back fifty years later and
B	yeah he might have though
A	it doesn't make any difference though like anybody you know
C	no it makes
B	he might say oh that what is it? I don't know I just know I have that thought
A	I think actually when I do things I don't really want to do is cos I think I'll regret it if I don't
B	yeah
A	it's like it's stuff you want to do but it's hard yeah
B	there's something it's partly unpleasant or difficult or effort or maybe you're just not as lazy?
C	well here's a yeah I this is
B	plus you don't have the same this is this like a one area I have you don't have this area with your parents
C	embarrassing but I have do you want to hear my embarrassing what?
B	you I mean your mum's not like losing it slowly so that you know that there's this sort of time period
C	I don't no I don't but
B	of course she is rather old
C	who? but it's I'm suspicious of the motive of wanting to do it so that it will have happened
B	no just cos I know that I like talking to my mum and that da da da da you know
C	but your mum is really already is not really there in the same way
B	no but she's still there like somewhat there
C	that's very that's very weird talking to people whose parents have gone further and they're obviously very
B	yeah I don't know what
C	they they always they take up a sort of defensive dismissiveness because they it's very obviously very upsetting you know they say oh she didn't know who I was and
B	yeah
C	erm and they they have to it's like doctors
B	yeah that's the only way you
C	doctors have to you know when they're in their first year of
B	you can't really display your true emotions cos it would be too awful like you're just in casual conversation you can't sort of start blathering
C	yeah but I think I think it's
B	so you sort of must do something
C	right yeah but
A	but that that would be a good sort of theme like the regret like some some sort of theme
C	yeah a kind of erm
B	yeah
C	as it were a
A	I can I can think quite easily for like Rome like you can quite easily like sort of youth in
C	what
A	like youth or like
C	oh you mean carpe diem or something that theme? what?
A	well just like sort of in the longer poems like
C	I don't know
A	but it would you know
C	right
A	and you get you never get such consistent
C	what about Plutarch?
A	never read that
C	just as just as interesting as Seneca really Seneca got I mean have I got the dates right? didn't he get most of it from Plutarch anyway? erm
C	yeah now that seems to be a good good idea to look at
A	yeah I know cos I did
C	reception
A	or no or receiving other texts like how was Seneca
C	oh
A	when he writes
C	yeah yeah
A	which can't be ignored
C	yeah it's just always going on all the time really I mean how do we receive Shakespeare? now there's just loads of stuff we're just not getting at all
A	but yeah but it's but it's if someone's people if someone's thing about Seneca and Euripides is that they're writing the same play in different language
C	you reckon? Seneca and Euripides?
A	well cos they both wrote in
B	what is that?
C	oh I see oh yeah but I don't think of Seneca as mainly a a playwright or I was thinking mainly of his letters and stuff it's true it's true though yeah
B	so is that an actual
C	a play?
B	no the term reception is that sort of a theoretical term in classics or literary theory I've never heard it before
C	oh yeah oh god yes literary theory mate you lived with a literary theory person
B	yeah she just like lost it and dropped out of academics
C	she got so tangled up with the French people
B	she got so freaked
C	Derrida
B	Derrida and
C	Deleuze and Guattari
B	a third year
C	oh
B	and she just
C	well I think flipped
B	she did she went off the deep end
C	no it's true I mean in one sense it's trivial that every person receives a different meaning from the
B	well there has to be like a lot of overlap though
C	I hope so yeah I I kind of like I like the sense that I can I another human being of the same species is talking to me across the centuries
B	yeah
C	erm but a lot of people
A	that's the point that's the reason why it was when when Seneca writes a
C	yeah sure but some people don't like that they're sort of super relativists and they say well you can it's just your reaction and you have no idea what they've
B	I wonder if that's kind of fallen out of fashion?
C	and it doesn't matter I don't know actually
B	I don't either
C	I don't know
A	especially cos do you know that
C	I've heard
A	cos he wrote a poem sort of
C	yeah
A	and he does like sort of Achilles as a child and doing cross-dressing
C	really?
B	Achilles?
A	yeah in
C	oh that's right yeah
B	oh okay
A	and then he like cos he wasn't just
C	how but she why is she worried cos she knows about the heel?
A	she knows that he's going to die
C	oh she knows he's going to die cos she held him by the heel?
A	yeah and that's interesting cos the thing is Thetis doesn't want if if it could as well be called the Thetis tale or something so both the Thetis and Statius know what's going to happen to Achilles but they're both sort of trying to delay it
C	cos Statius is the author
A	yeah
C	and she's the mother
A	yeah he's a writer
C	right
A	and then there's sort of it it stops and it's just as when just when he's erm on his way to Troy the poem stops people don't know if he did that deliberately
C	just on his say it again?
A	on his way to Troy and like when they get back into sort of epic general like
C	I see
A	I'm interested in sort of that like sense of belatedness
C	yeah
A	like trying to combat it
C	er what you want to
A	try to sort of
C	right but you don't know whether he stopped playing because
A	I think he did definitely did
C	no wow well so it's all it's all so rich there's so much life in it
B	that's true there's so much to think about
C	you can pee in there
B	nobody else has to pee I've already peed once so I'm not going in the other room
C	and me
C	oh there's a big oh it's Seneca who's like really
A	cos he I've got a module on
C	yeah oh yeah
A	which I think is really interesting
C	when is Tibullus? is he?
A	I'm not sure when he he's not really on it though
C	Lucan who is?
A	Lucan's sort of like he's like sort of like it's also interesting how he reacts to epic cos he he really wants to like tear it apart
C	right
A	and till right at the end he
C	that's right
A	he's like very angry
C	there's also this guy called Callinicus? did you come across him at all?
A	only sort of cos that's why I try and cos he's like what people talk about Alexandria
C	oh cos he's he's interesting cos he's like he's basically a postmodernist
A	yeah that that's why that's what sort of people like
C	oh right so I like to say when someone says you know who is I just say well actually is Callinicus was a postmodernist
C	he's sort of already gone kind of meta and he's sort of aware of language
A	yeah that's that's what that's what I really am interested in I think
C	yeah well that well yeah that's different from I mean that's fascinating
A	but that's
C	oh okay
A	that's part of their reception
C	yeah it's true yeah I think it must happen maybe it happens in every tradition that yeah
A	it's just
C	a recent person?
A	I think like eighties or something X in the first
C	oh
A	so there's not really
C	you mean the anxiety of influence?
A	no no no not that it's kind of when it's when someone says when X the idea of like X influencing Y is really just kind of belies the sophistication of that relationship
C	yeah I think well
A	cos if you then cos if you flip it round sort of saying Y remodelled X or Y parodied X or Y
C	yeah
A	that that's still a relationship of influence but it's not so straightforward
C	no
A	that's what I talk about when I talk about how Roman art relates to Greek art it's not really just copying it's an improvement
C	well sometimes but wait sometimes it starts off like that because you can see sometimes a poet starts off oh yeah they had a really good I was what's a good example? where they're just kind of totally in the in the grip of someone else and then they break through oh yeah I was reading about Beckett Beckett was like enslaved to Joyce and it was in the yeah I was reading it just like week in New York Review so that's one classic story that a poet or author on one hand is enslaved just worships X and and then they start to break free and stuff that seems to be a real story
A	mm
C	that happens erm but you're right in general that the whole idea of influence is you know complicated because rejection as it were violent rejection is a form of influence just as much as
A	yeah
C	trying to copy trying to imitate or emulate or yeah well well but it's yeah so that's but that's a different that's a that's a different kind of interest from isn't that from wanting to sort of pursue a philosophical theme in a literary framework?
A	yeah I suppose so
C	maybe you could do them all together
A	I mean that's what I how I really like to do
C	images of regret now what do I regret?
A	cos you could look at
C	I'll tell you something I regret
B	what?
C	so when I was in Israel I was being like really
B	pious
C	pious yeah and I met this girl from the Bronx
B	oh
C	in Jerusalem and she I don't know why I mean she just was really into me
B	I don't either
C	really really into me
B	probably really annoying
C	but I just sort of thought what?
B	you were probably
C	and she was really cute
B	and you were sort of oh I can't have sex because
C	yeah exactly but you see then then I went back to
B	wow
C	I wasn't there
B	what? how do you know she
C	I
B	how do you know she came by the house?
C	because because
B	oh
C	so I regret that
B	that's very deep
C	very deep very deep
B	you're blushing
C	am I?
B	well yeah next time I drink too much
C	next time
B	I'll confess to who I
C	well babe I haven't drunk too much
B	I'm just kidding I'm kidding talk talk talk
C	I do not want another one
B	maybe we should open another bottle of wine and have a teeny bit right now because tomorrow night
C	that's very subtle reasoning babe erm
B	that was actually really
C	no it was
B	that was pretty good
C	it was really nice and it was I mean actually I think
B	I think you should just get a cheap one because
C	I think they're making a profit those people but it's erm it's exactly the model that a nice
B	god I'm tired I'm
C	you want tea? I just have to
B	yeah because I mean
C	the screw top because
B	we might not finish it by tomorrow night I mean
C	what's so terrible about tomorrow? oh Thursday
B	cos we're going to be leaving on Friday also we need to I think we should just hire a car
C	well hiring a car means I'm getting a bit worried about all these expenses that I'm not properly
B	yeah he didn't drink it he went back I can't get this I can never do these
C	it's awfully serious sweet
B	yeah it's very intellectual
C	I mean I think
B	oh he's recording us so
C	ah oh
B	I almost fell down the stairs
C	so how?
C	is it still recording?
B	yeah
C	oh my god no it's not oh I won't say anything now
A	it's probably got a bit to go actually in a minute
B	so can you just send I mean do they ever reject what you send as being you know sort of unsuitable?
A	no
B	so you're just going to send that two hours
C	I think by definition it can't be unsuitable by definition because you're just trying to
A	I think they're just looking for patterns
C	sweep the language you wonder are they trying to get a picture of the language?
A	well I
B	wow
C	so it's like English as she is spoken today?
B	yeah
C	this is the truth
B	well especially looking at the
C	well no they're not
