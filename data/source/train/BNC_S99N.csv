B	yeah oh
C	we look for castles or
D	well you can't miss them in Wales
A	yeah
C	is there?
B	oh right
D	mm
A	well that was only cos the English built the castles to to defeat the Welsh
B	we went to
D	hmm
B	oh sorry I don't
A	and then in the end what happened I I don't know what king it was but he said we'll make him
D	mm
A	and we'll and I'll give you and you can have a prince
D	hmm mm mm
A	and
C	huh?
A	that's yeah
C	I don't get it
A	well the King of England at the time
C	mm mm
A	and he said I'll give you a prince
C	right
D	hmm
B	mm
A	and they accepted him as the Prince of Wales and now he we we still got the Prince of Wales going on and on and on and on
C	in the Royal family
A	in the Royal family
B	they made the baby for
C	cheeky
A	yeah and that that's how  that's how  the Prince of Wales came about
B	mm
C	mm
D	hmm
A	clever you know these medieval people
B	mm
D	hmm mm
B	yeah
C	why did Wales accept a prince from us?
A	well they're a bit
C	why didn't they say well we can find our own prince
B	I don't know
A	well that's a bit
D	well they probably had a a sword to their throat
B	mm
A	mm probably
D	I remember the Welsh were really
A	yeah they were
D	they were really good archers
A	yeah
D	and that's where the like sticking two fingers up that's where that one comes from
A	that's right yeah
C	I
D	because they defeated the English like using their bow and arrow
A	yeah
D	and then which leaves the two fingers doesn't it
C	is that true?
A	they used to cut the two fingers off didn't they the Welsh
D	mm
A	they used to cut the fingers off
D	hmm
A	so that they couldn't fight again
C	so that they couldn't use a bow and arrow?
A	and when the Welsh won they said we've still got our two fingers
D	mm
A	and that's how the two finger thing come on
C	what the English cut off the Welsh fingers?
A	they used to that's what they used to do
C	so that they couldn't use their bow and arrow?
A	yeah
C	ah
D	hmm
C	how did it ever change to one finger?
A	that's a modern one that is
D	happy Days?
A	yeah
C	oh
A	and then that that became sit on it
D	hmm
C	sit oh really?
A	mm
C	I never knew that
A	well I don't know I I couldn't say that that was true but
C	in Italy
A	that's what they used to
C	I think it's Italy isn't it? That
D	I don't know what you're talking about
D	how am I supposed to know what you're talking about?
C	well that it's rude to have the your fingers like the victory
D	oh lots of countries it they've all got their er little things haven't they
A	yeah yeah
C	mm
D	like in Turkey you can't go like that
C	like this for us is peace or victory
