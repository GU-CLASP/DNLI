D	who?
A	his mate
D	same one as
D	but they've always been
A	yeah they've always been mates
D	it's a big

A	which is nice yeah cos there are some kids down there aren't there? little shits
D	some little shits over that fucking
A	oh did you?
D	yeah
A	what for your kids? why?
D	well I was shouting out of the window

A	cos you can't do anything to her
D	no I can't I've never
A	well regardless don't come out shouting have a go at your frigging kids that are trying to steal something
D	but I I think to be honest with you I don't think she had a husband beyond that
D	yeah
A	probably that how old were the kids?
D	one of them was about
A	oh
D	and one was about
A	yeah yeah plenty old enough though they weren't little little
D	well I was watching it and I see
A	yeah
D	it was like out my window
A	and yeah
D	eh?
A	do you look at the park?
D	yeah yeah
A	ah
D	I looked out
A	I haven't been to your flat yet
D	watching my telly
A	yeah you can see the park
D	my window
D	well I
A	mm
D	fuck off you little cunts

A	I mean I don't blame the parents if they're
D	oh they're only playing
A	that big but
D	she's gone they're only playing
A	I'm sure they understand that
D	oh boys will be I said fuck off and get your husband up here
A	I mean you
D	fucking poncing about
A	I mean
D	well never used to run off with someone's coat and put it in the mud
A	no that's true that's just bullying at that point
D	well yeah
A	and did you know them? had you seen them before that time?
D	I don't think so no
A	no
D	but no no their
A	no
D	that's exactly the point
D	you get some right wrong'uns round here and all I tell you
D	people from
A	I think that's
D	blacks
A	in general
D	oh that's getting worse here I tell you it's really bad over here now
A	I mean it's nothing to do with race or anything it's just that there's really bad parents out there at the moment
D	yeah
A	no no that's not paying attention to their kids at all
D	half of then have never worked in their life
A	it's just a shame I feel bad for the children
A	her brother and his
D	oh right oh
A	yeah he's a their little boy he's not even I think he's five and
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	and they still didn't fit him and he's five
D	five
A	he said his arms are like this thick now
D	yeah they're bigger than yours
A	he said you and you see a little kid if you see the other little boys next to him he's like three times their size
D	it's cos they sit there and eat shit
A	and then just yeah
D	probably
A	and they're like they're trying to say it's genetics and like it's just glands and all that bollocks
A	he said like all they do the worst thing for them is they have a car so all they do is get in their car and they'll drive absolutely anywhere regardless of how close it is
D	I mean look the size of er
A	yeah
D	have you seen the size of
A	I know
A	there's nothing to do with it is it? and
D	but she had
A	but she's not that big
D	no
A	and
A	don't even care the thing is that
D	her jesus of course
A	that child is gonna have diabetes by the time it's bloody twelve or something he's gonna get
D	yeah he's gonna have
A	bullied at school he's gonna have no confidence during his whole life
D	er
A	yeah
A	I think I don't think I'd be able to keep my mouth shut after seeing him I might do something subtle about saying
D	five years of age and he's all
D	yeah it ain't no good is it?
A	nine to ten-year-olds I was saying about
C	oh
A	what's his name?
C	I know isn't it terrible?
A	five years old
C	he's not he's not as though he's a
A	no no I think he's tall at all for his age was still
C	wow
A	no
D	throwing up?
A	well they
D	I know
D	I mean
C	they're children
A	they're children yeah
D	I mean
A	I know exactly
A	yeah
D	then he'll walk about for five minutes and
A	and he's alright
D	yeah
A	that's cos he
D	but he's got a
A	metabolism
D	yeah that obviously is he's got an
A	I mean of course yeah I think metabolism plays a part otherwise
D	ain't always an excuse is it?
A	no and not to any dramatic
C	and the type of food makes a lot of difference as well
A	exactly exactly
C	do you want tea?
A	yeah I'll have a green tea
C	yes please
A	oh you're
A	oh yes your programme started then mum? sorry
C	mummy done all that driving today

C	not that you was in the car I know
A	you know the place I plan to ride my bicycle is
D	did
B	I had a lock and key I gave to
D	and when you lock it up make sure you put the lock through the frame as well as the wheel
A	yeah as well as the wheel so then just
B	well the guy told me that
D	cos they'll just take the wheel off and
A	and take the frame yeah
A	cos it's the frame that's worth the money I suppose
B	put it through the whatsisname bit
A	yeah
B	where the pedals are in through the back wheels and the
A	I mean I'm not gonna leave
B	yeah cos
A	CCTV
B	well lock them together when you go out
A	and I'm not gonna
D	well yeah it's expensive
A	that's expensive
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	put it upstairs on a balcony when you don't use it
A	yeah I haven't seen the flat yet have I?
D	I mean
A	no no that one was I don't even know where they got that one from

A	it's alright though I don't know it's
D	well that I've had to replace the suspension
A	yeah it got a er I I
D	I've confirmed about twenty different brake blocks
A	oh have you?
D	well I'm on a
A	yeah
D	I don't walk nowhere now
A	it's a shame people don't er
D	oh well they are round here now
A	yeah it's getting more popular
D	cos it's cheap and easy
A	yeah it is yeah it's cheaper and easier
D	I can get from my house to
A	yeah yeah yeah I bet you can stop in all those bloody lights in the traffic
D	you can
A	on a especially during
D	I could get there I could do it in ten minutes
A	I plan to do it I plan to use it to get cos our uni's about
D	six
A	so it's about four miles isn't it?
D	well I'll tell you in a sec
A	and I there's a train station right by us which is good gets us there in like seven minutes
D	if you press that there so six kilometres into miles
A	yeah you got an app for it
D	six
A	what does it say?
D	when it says speak speak into it
A	six kilometres into miles
D	yeah
A	did it not work? I think I missed it slightly
D	no
A	I'm not very good with technology yet
D	six kilometres into miles
A	three
D	I wanna punch
A	no yeah that's right though
D	six kilometres?
A	yeah yeah yeah it's three point what miles?
D	three point seven miles
A	it's just the way the computer picks up the language that's one of the things actually that
D	you have to be quite loud
A	yeah it's one of the
D	oh right?
A	so like some of the stuff that I can
D	yeah that's good
A	rich people can't do that
A	he locked it all up did he?
C	is your bike out there?
A	no I put it up front
D	three point seven miles
A	yeah that'll be right if I could cycle
D	three miles ain't nothing
A	ain't nothing yeah on a bicycle the only thing is there's a
D	it takes about twenty minutes at the most
A	there's a I don't know what the actual
D	dual carriageways? what's that like an A road?
A	is that an A road what's a dual carriageway?
C	no
A	typically
D	oh
A	no like two lanes
C	no I don't think you can
A	cos I know some roads like
D	no I wouldn't
A	you can't go on the busiest roads with
D	no you can't
A	most like
C	I don't know
D	well you can't ride along the A2 I know that
C	do you know that stretch of road up erm
A	maybe they're not all A roads cos people used to cycle to
D	I mean you got the bike
A	yeah
D	and you can't ride along there either
A	no along there no
D	not unless you've got a death wish
A	there must be a route that goes from
C	but
A	can get from the town to my university by some sort of
C	yeah yeah
D	where do you live?
D	to where?
D	I'm not being funny if you've done that it
A	yeah
D	it'll map out a route for you
A	to
D	if you
A	try like
A	woah does it speak to you like that then? it
D	if you spoke to it quite close
A	that's yeah technology's improved cos your
D	well no no no one understands me on the phone
A	yeah what's the route do then? cos this is by car obviously and does it tell you if there are A roads or
D	hold on it's just loading up
A	M roads or mm
D	let it load up and I'll see what it says
A	so how did your
D	well I pay seven fifty a month but
A	it's
D	but I'm paying an extra fiver for free internet
A	okay
D	so it's
A	twelve fifty a month
D	no
A	oh right so it's not bad that's six fifty-five
D	what's going on in there
A	yeah that's right
D	via the A2
A	oh so there's two different ways I can go
D	via
A	yeah that does go straight
D	yeah you
A	I think there's a bypass that goes round
D	unless there's a cycle line that runs up beside the
A	yeah yeah which would be nice if there was but I don't actually know I guess we'll figure that out pretty quickly
D	that's crazy
A	cos erm
D	it
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	by talking to your phone for like
A	it tells you
D	fucking
A	well it just searches the internet for you doesn't it?
D	but it's how quick it does it
A	yeah it is quick
D	I mean most of my mates got these phones they're like
A	yeah like a almost a tablet
D	but this does everything
A	so where did you find your phone and your contract? cos I'm at the moment
D	Three network
A	is it Three network? did you find it online on the internet or did you go into a shop?
D	well no I started off with a
A	oh yeah and they contacted you?
D	yeah basically cos I spent so much money topping it up all the time
A	yeah I know I put ten pounds on this like Tuesday and it's basically gone
D	I get
A	and I'm like that's one week of credit and I haven't done anything with it I haven't called anyone really
D	oh right
A	I sent out a few text messages and like made a couple of one-minute phone calls and it's gone
A	yeah yeah well I know you can do that as well cos you've got the internet on it
D	cos yeah cos I got free internet
A	unless you I think if I pay if you went on the internet on this unless I have been doing it without knowing about it
A	actually that's the point maybe this phone could've
D	I get two hundred minutes
A	yeah
D	it's
A	that's also it's free
D	it's completely free
A	who else is on three? is
D	no my mate
A	ah
D	and
A	ah that's
D	but he never takes his phone home
A	I have to look it up on the internet first
D	and all I pay is eleven pound
A	getting a bad
D	I pay eleven pound fifty a month
A	yeah see so many people cos before I swear the standard contract was like thirty quid a month but now
D	but
A	I speak to so many people have got those for ten pounds eleven pounds
D	ah that's ridiculous now because
A	seven pounds
D	there's so many deals
A	and it includes like way more than I
D	and the
A	yeah
D	well I can watch films on it and everything
A	yeah I guess that's when the big screen comes in handy but I mean
D	when it falls out the bed
A	it has to be pretty big
D	just sitting there like that
A	for it to be much different surely
D	or laying in bed just sitting like that in can just watch a film
A	see? you can't that tablet thing
D	yeah I've tried
A	oh right
D	when it's zoomed in so much it's making it pixelate if you know what I mean
A	oh right
D	mm
A	I haven't really looked at it so I don't really know
D	look at it that website look
A	yeah
D	me and
A	oh right is this all the films you can watch on it then?
D	these are
A	oh are they? ah
D	streaming I suppose
A	you watching it live
D	yeah
A	is there another Spider-Man out?
D	that's
A	really?
D	it's probably on
A	you watch it on that do you?
D	yeah
A	I wonder if you can get anything
D	any TV show if you click on the shows
A	mm
D	there's just thousands of them
A	that's a handy website to have
D	if you're sitting there and the same the electric goes or you get a power cut
A	mm
D	but I
A	somehow your phone's charged ha
D	yeah
A	does it kill your battery a lot quicker when you keep going on the internet? using the internet?
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	if I had one if I had a smart TV
A	mm
D	I could plug this into a smart TV right? and it'd come up in this
A	yeah yeah I've heard that as well
D	but my telly is
A	yeah
D	oh when I moved in I was walking up the stairs
A	thought you were gonna go down with it
D	I said dad I wanna go I wanna go
A	oh
D	and he's just
A	oh it was that then?
D	yeah
D	and he stood no he just stood there
D	fucking idiots they didn't even
A	didn't think you were actually gonna go is that considered a smart TV what mum and dad had
D	no this wouldn't this wouldn't work on it
A	no no mm as in
D	yeah I mean we
A	yeah
D	about a year or two but
A	mm
D	and clicked on say Expendables three
A	mm
D	you could sit there and watch it on
A	on the TV
D	on a full screen yeah
A	do you have to physically plug something in or does it
D	yeah
A	hook it up by Bluetooth or wireless or whatever?
D	if I plug the lead into there
A	oh the USB or
D	yeah you
A	yeah it's USB lead yeah
D	and into his telly
A	it's good isn't it?
D	bosh
A	that's what I
D	a home video er
A	yeah
D	you can watch it on the full screen
A	are you sure mum's and dad's doesn't do that?
D	I've tried it with that and it won't
A	it doesn't work
D	and that's the newest phone
A	is it? that's a little bit too old cos a lot of the TVs like that LG
D	it costs it's a smartphone
A	LG Samsung they're both Korean makes
D	it's
A	TVs in Korea you can just plug a USB in and watch anything
D	yeah well when I'm might be able to
A	all the new ones
A	no
D	I've tried it
A	maybe it's still slightly different software then
D	but that's a smart
A	yeah
D	since Christmas
A	Christmas ah that's
D	well mum bought that for me it was a Christmas present
A	but it didn't it didn't come with the SIM card you got that SIM card through
D	no yeah I got a contract separate
A	alright then
D	what is it? let's have a look
A	it's men I'm I didn't know but my friends've told me it's ripping off a Blackberry
D	oh
A	and now we don't know
D	oh is this what
A	no dad had it for ages I think he got it from a boot
D	he gave it to the
A	oh did he?
D	where's that other thing you had?
A	I've just had flip phone which I've still got upstairs
D	oh
A	and it's really simple and I tempted to go back to it because this thing
D	too small ain't they?
A	yeah really close together
D	well it's
D	I mean if you went if you went to a Three shop right?
A	mm
D	you could probably get a contract
A	mm
D	and er
A	yeah
D	and then you got
A	bigger see I've got have you seen my MP3 player? it's like that
D	oh I thought that was a phone
A	no it's not a phone all it is is an MP3 player that can pick up wi-fi
D	oh right like an Ipod
A	yeah oh yeah the Ipods can do it as well can't they?
D	yeah I think so
A	like
D	yeah he watches Youtube everything
A	so providing like I can't receive data I can't get internet anywhere but if there's a wi-fi
D	oh right
A	and then it acts like a
D	I thought that was a phone
A	no
D	yeah
A	than that
D	well if I'm honest with you
A	yeah
D	I don't need to cos I've got
A	no cos you've got that yeah
D	I've got free internet there's no need for me to have
A	it's really changed hasn't it? the way phones it's like do you remember like in like a really short amount of time as well
D	in the space of about five years
A	yeah I've gone from my Vodafone flip phone to being a bit out of date
D	yeah you had wi-fi?
A	to everything
D	and that
A	no yeah oh yeah to have wi-fi I guess it's still for erm
D	unless
A	it's still for
D	them big tablets and all that but
A	yeah or for like computers laptops still
D	oh I know but I've got TV guide thing app I downloaded the other day
A	mm
D	yeah I mean
A	then it's useful to have the wi-fi
D	I do all my job searches on here everything
A	yeah I know it's really handy
D	but I don't tell the job centre that
A	no
D	I say I have to go to the library
A	yeah well
D	they haven't paid me for about nearly a month
A	it's good that you're so good with it cos sometimes I
D	mm yeah it's strange innit?
A	but it depends how well
D	my mates
A	it takes longer yeah
D	I mean normally that TV guide would be there now but
A	handy though cos
D	cos we've got dodgy signal
A	yeah
D	I don't go out and buy the papers and that
A	no and also it means like you said it's
D	and
A	and call them
D	yeah
A	you can do Face Facetime or whatever
D	if you
D	have you got the messenger app? it's that
A	no I haven't got
D	that little
A	that little thing
D	with the yeah
A	no no no I don't have that see I still access to
D	oh right
A	I didn't know the Facebook picture thing
D	yeah
A	you just click on it and automatically it's
D	well that's the Facebook app
A	yeah yeah
D	so
A	whereas I go through I go into Google and I log in manually every time
D	yeah yeah I don't like that one I've got I've got one with this one better
A	cos I can't
D	I remember when video tapes come out
D	oh yeah yeah I've seen it yeah
