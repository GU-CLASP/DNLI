A	yeah so erm yeah
B	right
A	an kind of open choir apparently this woman has sent out invitations to all the people that she knew
B	wow
A	yeah
B	that's pretty
A	that's a good take up isn't it?
B	that's pretty good isn't it?
A	yeah that's what I thought so
B	ah that's bad
B	if you like? if you can like match pitch a few times then you can definitely do it
A	mm aw right
B	but it's just effort
A	yeah well I did say to her that you'd been having singing lessons she's going oh oh singing lessons I said yeah she's got a good teacher at the guitar school which doesn't sound quite right does it?
B	no
A	erm and she's going oh well maybe your daughter would be interested then? I said no I think she's got rather a lot on
A	I
B	you got gently nudged towards the door
A	whether that was my choice or hers is lost in the mist of time but
B	ah
A	but anyway erm I was telling her about yoga and singing
B	mm I thought that was where this was going
A	mm and erm cos she was saying to me you don't have to be that good and it's amazing if you've got a good teacher and all the rest of it er and I said about
B	yeah
A	what she used to do was you know loosen up the muscles in your neck and in your diaphragm and
B	yeah what what's her book called Jumbala or something
A	er Jumbalani
B	Jumbalani
A	Jumbalani yeah and erm and so that really helped prepare for getting sounds out and as I was saying to her you didn't have to well in fact you're sort of
B	discouraged?
A	went away from yeah not discouraged can't think can't think anyway
B	mm I know what you mean
A	from singing something that was known to everybody because you kind of almost take on an affectation of how you think it should sound
B	yeah
A	and so she was very clever in that what she did when she got us all singing together was erm get us singing in another language you know?
B	mm
A	so a lot of it was sort of African tribal folk sort of singing which you know? again you couldn't associate particular words with particular feelings or whatever so it was just more the sounds of the words
B	yeah yeah
A	and so it was getting the the voice and you know? everything working to get that sound erm
B	oh
A	baritones who were the sopranos and all the rest of it
B	sopranos
A	yeah and then get it so that we were all positioned where we could bounce off one another better
B	yeah nice
A	and and it never failed to surprise me at the end of each session when we did our joint you know? number as it were erm even if it was just a chant of some kind
B	yeah
A	just the incredible depth and resonance of the sounds that were coming out of all of us really you know?
B	mm
A	well you must find that with your singing teacher and some of the exercises he teaches you
B	yeah
B	but you you go from like
A	yeah
B	hah but I can't I can't do it cos I'm sitting down
B	but it's like hah hah hah
A	bit like monkey chant in Baraka
B	but properly
A	do you remember the monkey? yeah
A	oh very good
B	it's like no but I can't do it properly right now cos I'm
A	right
B	I'm just more horizontal sort of yeah
A	wow
B	I need to like be taking breathing breaths properly and using my diaphragm
A	right
B	but just what we were saying about Jumbalani or whatever it was beforehand
A	mm mm
B	it reminds me there's so many weird names in the play I'm doing
A	oh is there?
B	but he's just created the most difficult to say names like I have one to say that's like
A	is it erm? Is it a foreign playwright anyway? who is it?
B	Brecht
A	oh it's Brecht what's he? German or something?
B	think so
A	sounds very Germanic doesn't it?
B	yeah but I don't know his name I think it was just a made up cos they're all
A	made up names?
B	they're all like they're all like
B	I'm trying to think of what my name is cos I'm just the governor's wife
A	right
B	I'm pretty sure I have a name I just don't know what it is
B	and then
A	actually it sounds more kind of Eastern European Russian actually doesn't it?
B	yeah actually to be fair I'm pretty sure it's set in Russia
A	oh it is Russia right
B	so
A	mm
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	I'm just butchering them
B	but er
B	I just can't say them
A	get your laughing gear round that
B	laughing gear is that like a like another name for a mouth?
B	laughing gear I love it
B	oh that's so happy
A	I I
B	no
A	okay there used to be this advert on telly god what did she?

A	but then we are talking
B	well there you go
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah that's it thanks
B	come on you're better than that
A	ah so you think you might reuse that one?
B	your laughing gear I'll just get the strangest looks I got the strangest looks when I used the word drat once
B	they was like that's not a word I was like it is a word
B	don't do this to me but don't make me question the foundations of my own life
B	and then I was going I don't think you oh my gods has has mummy invented this word? have I invented this word?
B	and then I looked it up and it was like oh oh it is a word
B	drat I like it drowned rat it sounds like
A	you ought to really freak them out with some Welsh terminology
B	there's not there's not really any like sort of drat type
A	shucks

B	it should be babel
A	yeah it would work
B	what was? what were other Welsh terms? I could just start speaking in Welsh
[ANNOTATION]	Person B has doubt about how babel is gonna work	Entailment
B	but I just have to throw out random words at them
A	mm
B	cos I don't know actual sentences

B	yeah
A	well the valleys are even more particular but
B	they've kind of got a they've got a like a harshness to it
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they come there often to film drama	Entailment

B	you'd have like soft Welsh thick Welsh and kind of like more defined Welsh
A	mm mm I prefer the Swansea accent to the Cardiff accent Swansea is is

A	Cardiff is a lot more brisk
B	it's a bit more uppy
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't really favour the Cardiff accent.	Entailment
A	yeah and uppy yeah
A	god what are we thinking about?
B	trying to describe accents
B	Cardiff is uppy

[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has already studied the linguistics last year.	Contradiction
B	but mostly next year it's child development and region I think

B	mm yeah might be good
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	ah yeah cos I've got to do a I've got to do a project on
A	oh right
B	I just having like ten language experts
[ANNOTATION]	There is no child development course in speaker's B curriculum.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	There is no child development course in speaker's B curriculum.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	connected to me and I think that that that's nice
A	absolutely yeah on hand
B	yeah
B	yes
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B enjoys having the language experts close.	Entailment
B	that would be good
A	yeah well I guess you've got to get this year out of the way first haven't you? so you've got your exam just after
unknown	half-term
B	yeah
A	but
B	it's in like a couple of weeks
[ANNOTATION]	The first year is harder than the exam.	Neutral
A	yeah it is only well is it only a couple of weeks? or is is three? three weeks
B	exactly three weeks but one is going to be half-term so
A	yeah
B	it's going to be next week
A	mm hm
B	okay so it's at the end of the fourth week
A	right okay yeah
B	but one week it's going to be half-term I do get all of Thursday and Friday off timetable though to be fair
A	oh really?
B	I may I think I might get Wednesday off as well because we just got to do runs and then we're doing performances Thursday and Friday
A	yeah
B	which you can come to but tickets are six pounds
A	oh well that's okay
B	yeah cos they were like erm and then they were you must try and get as many people as you can as you can to come you know? to give you a nice supportive audience we were like
A	yeah
B	and they're like no they're six pounds they wouldn't be free and it was like well in my school they were free
A	yes yeah
B	yeah
A	ah okay well that's an evening one then on the Thursday or the Friday
B	yeah it's at seven
A	hold on a moment isn't the week after? is the week after half-term? oh no it's the week after your birthday isn't it? I was just thinking it's not your birthday is it?
B	yeah no we before half-term is my birthday
A	oh okay
B	yeah
A	well that's alright
A	plenty of time
B	yeah for like a half done play
A	ah
A	yeah you know how these things come together?
B	I'll probably just
A	by hook or by crook
B	yeah just have to spend a lot of time going over my lines cos I know them but I know them loosely and I need to be like
A	right
B	just I don't I need to be not even thinking about them just be like doing
A	mm have you got it on audio tape or anything? would it help though to have a?
B	I don't like I don't like doing it like that
A	oh really?
B	no cos I don't I don't focus on it cos I'll be doing other things and if i'm going to sit there I won't want
A	oh no I was thinking like you know? a podcast on the way into college sort of thing
B	yeah but I don't think so
A	doesn't work for you
A	ah right
B	we cut an entire scene
A	right
B	we cut most of one of like the central characters
B	because there's kind of the play is like kind of almost
A	mm
B	and then it kind of links in to the main bit at the end
A	right
B	so cut most of that bit out
A	oh mm hm
B	and just kept the ending bit
A	yeah
B	and it still makes sense
A	right
B	I think
B	probably
A	right
B	I don't know cos the the thing is there's going to be three plays on that night and ours will be one of them and the other two groups will be doing theirs
A	ah okay
B	so I don't know what what order we're going to be in
A	oh so what? the other drama groups doing different plays?
B	yeah
A	from texts
B	yeah
A	ah okay
B	we're actually quite lucky cos in our group we're only doing one play amongst all of us in the other groups they're doing like two plays
A	right mm
B	yeah it's like I think there's only one other group though so there might be two of us so it's like two to four other plays apart from ours
A	okay
B	I
A	ah
B	like I'm genuinely impressed with what our teachers have well with what our main teacher at the moment has managed to come up with for that
A	really?
B	cos to make the same set work for three plays is like a feat
A	oh my goodness yeah well you know you
B	he's just got to stay there the whole time
A	you think about erm oh the Victorian plays that I did
B	yeah
A	you know the scene changes in that I thought that was really inventive the way they put them on erm you know roller roller well rollers basically and just switched them you know so that it was
B	yeah yeah but we
A	no so it's got to be
A	so how are they differentiating then between each play? are they just adding a little few props to sort of
B	well yeah we've got other props for ourselves
A	mm
B	and we've got chairs that come up the sides but like we've got the chalk circle on the stage that's our bit
A	right
B	and then one of the other plays has fencing at the back and then one of the other plays has all these crates at the back but we use the crates in our play as well and we keep stuff inside of them
A	oh okay mm
B	and then there's the archway which is for us and I think another play need it as well
A	right yeah
B	it's it's been very well done I have to say
A	yeah yeah
B	by what she's told us of it
A	mm
B	but now we just need to get the puppet made
A	you've got a puppet on yours?
B	like a puppet
A	really?
B	a puppet child
A	puppet who's who's doing the puppet?
B	er I think one of the techies
A	oh okay
B	and and she was talking to him today cos he was going into his little room and she was like
A	box yeah
B	yeah and she was like have you started on the puppet and he was like no not yet
B	so that should be fun mm cos we need to rehearse for the puppet but the puppet's only in like half of it cos at the beginning it's a baby and then it's like
A	oh I see oh yeah blimey that
B	I'm just hoping it's limbs don't fall off
A	mm
B	that would
A	yeah he'd want to get cracking on that what's it going to be? a papier mâché  one
B	oh my god no it's it's going to be a wire a wire with like clothes over it
A	right mm
B	yeah it's really interesting
A	yeah that's going to take some rehearsing
B	but I had to be like be tugging off there's two of us and we have to like tug on it
A	mm
B	but the other girl doesn't really tug on it I tug on it the most and I'm just imagining
A	mm
B	came off in my hand
A	yeah
B	cos I'm just like yes the other person has
unknown	arm
A	she'd give her right arm for that arm yeah oh dear
unknown	yeah
B	can't do that we just well we'll just well we probably won't be tugging on it very much
A	mm mm well I shall look forward to seeing that part particularly
B	yeah
A	that scene
B	well it's like the trolley bit isn't it from
A	oh yeah from
B	we've
A	but it was alright on the night wasn't it? worked out yeah
B	yeah thank god
A	and the wheelie bins
B	yeah the wheelie bins were alright though
A	yeah
B	although there was a bit when they were trying to wheel me to the front inside of it at first and it was like this isn't going to work I'm going to go flying onto the floor but then we're like I'll sort of crouch and follow them and then climb into it
A	mm
A	mm ah
