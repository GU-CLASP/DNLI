A	erm it's the end of part one
B	gonna try for a first?
A	tut erm maybe yeah
B	you know what I would say? I would say it's worth it
A	yeah well er it's just sort of satisfying as well
B	and it's satisfying exactly erm
A	like if you
B	well are you enjoying it?
A	yeah I enjoy I like it I like the work and stuff
B	that's nice
A	it's interesting
B	are you learning stuff?
A	yeah
B	and you're pleased with your tutors?
A	yeah they're all good
B	well I'm very glad to hear it cos you know really
A	yeah
B	and not very helpful
A	mm
B	and you know both her mum and I have said look you're paying nine thousand a year you wanna get your
B	money's worth
A	cos also lots of
B	but she's also finding the work
A	yeah she er erm messaged me the other week cos she's doing a
B	I think yeah
A	in the ancient Mediterranean
B	I think that's really interesting
A	so I was telling her some texts er sort sort of cos the Romans were really obsessed with bees
B	were they?
A	yeah
B	were they?
A	they think they could
B	did they
B	well I think it'd be really great if she can put together a thesis on that
A	yeah
B	because erm I mean I suppose there are some are there? some complete what's happened there?
A	oh it got smashed up
B	erm well she ought we ought to pick your brains then
A	yeah I mean
B	I don't think we've got any further erm much since then
B	you know I would just as soon put my faith in a swarm of bees as I would in the in the weather forecast these days
A	yeah
B	erm
A	erm I don't have I mean I probably will do a dissertation next year but I haven't I can't really
B	no what's reception theory?
A	it's kind of like just the way you I think it it just makes classics sort of relevant to me the way
B	did they say twelve minutes for this?
A	ah
B	oh
A	so it's just the way sort of it's it's really sort of simple it's just the way you respond to something it's the way you receive it
B	yes
A	but it's in classics it's interesting because there's sort of a
B	er
A	over sort of it make it makes the the work sort of
B	and look at it new yes
A	yeah it's it's that's why it's like sort of simple but
B	yes
A	I
B	yes
A	the it's not the end all and be all
B	right
A	mm
B	er was going to be er seen very differently from the way it is now
A	yeah
B	and lots of people can't do that they can't make that leap erm you know there's erm a that's that's one of the things I didn't like about postmodernism when it came in or or literary theory that that everything was judged from the viewpoint now er I mean
A	yeah
B	that was the world he was born into he why would he have taken much notice of that? he was an artist so you can't say these paintings aren't any good or not to be taken seriously or we dismiss them erm because they are politically doubtful
A	yeah
B	not er they're not fixed very little is fixed
A	it's interesting yeah exactly which is just sort of
B	yes
A	erm and I think it's just more interesting and more more good to think with like more sort of gives your er your own ideas
B	well I know that at some point a few months ago
A	yeah
B	and I thought actually for archaeology that is really difficult
A	yeah
B	and chemically dated and so on how are you supposed to be original about that?
A	it's not easy really
B	I mean I think those Tudors were just bored and they've come up with they want to be entertained a bit
A	but they might
B	yes
A	instead of just copying things out of books
B	exactly otherwise you know er erm and you know
A	he's er I think he's alright he's actually I saw him last night he's in
B	right
A	erm I think he's
B	oh has he?
A	I mean he has like a sort of study period that he er and then does exams I think
B	right
A	but I think his sort of tuition has ended already
B	okay really? and we're only in March
A	well it ends er or it ends in ends in
B	and is he supposed to do stuff on his own?
A	yeah I think they er I think he'll he'll have work to do but he doesn't have to be in
B	right
A	dunno
B	you don't know?
B	you don't know if there's a new girlfriend on the scene?
A	erm I don't know if there is should be
B	well it's perfectly possible to go for a little while without
B	erm and you've still got your lovely cake-maker?
A	yeah
B	well done
B	was it? did she make a special cake?
A	I'm taking her I'm er taking her tomorrow to erm
B	no
A	it's in
B	yeah
A	and they you can go you go there and there's erm it's famous for sort of seafood shacks where you can get oysters and stuff
B	oh those sorts of places are wonderful
A	yeah and it's sort of really a bit strange and spooky
B	oh how nice what fun
A	yeah and
B	you're gonna go fishing?
A	she likes fishing
B	right
A	just take
B	can you fish? have you ever fished?
A	mm only in sort of line fishing
B	well what else is there?
A	rod fishing
B	oh right
A	and then when you catch something you er
B	and then you catch something or you don't
A	you just pull it up yeah
B	but rod fishing you throw it in with a fly and
A	yeah
B	and all that
A	yeah
B	yes quite I tried to do it once I just couldn't cope with the flies or the maggots
B	actually no no you're such a traveller
A	we went to Mexico and our friend erm he had sort of got a really expensive
B	oh how wonderful
A	but it was seven hours didn't catch anything
B	no
A	and then he spent the whole time
A	what sea?
B	yes
A	Pacific Ocean
B	Pacific?
A	there's not enough in there anymore
B	seasick? oh there's nothing worse than that
A	yeah well it was a bit sort of like that
B	I only have to think of a ship
A	yeah
B	when I was first with your grandad erm we used to often go to France
B	and I was sitting kneeling with my head in the loo and it was
B	apparently a lot of sailors get seasick for the first twenty-four hours cos
A	right
B	er for a while and he said for the first twenty-four hours he was usually he was usually sick
A	yeah and er sort of once you've been on a boat for ages getting back onto land
B	yes yes but that's slightly better well it doesn't seem natural to me
A	yeah mainly I mean it's er I've I've got friends in
A	just sort of
A	so er he's er he's it's funny to to be at school with him again because we went different places for sixth form and he's er in the year above
B	and he's at
A	yeah
B	and what's he doing?
A	at the same college
B	at the same college?
A	yeah
B	right does that give you a bond erm being in the same school?
A	yeah but it's funny it's sort of just like erm sort of started off together and then finished together
B	that's interesting what does he want to do?
A	I don't know I
B	right
A	but he's
B	we've got perfectly good left-wing actually no perfectly good corrupt mayor now don't think we ever want another not left-wing
B	is he?
A	erm er my friend is is er quite I think quite passionate about leftist politics on
B	so who's he gonna vote for?
A	dunno probably Green
B	what I haven't worked out is what happens if you vote for Green
B	cos that's what I I mean I can't bring myself to vote for any of the others what are you gonna vote?
A	I don't know really
B	it's difficult isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I mean the Greens
A	well they might get a seat somewhere I mean they do have seats
B	they might get a couple of seats er which
A	I mean it'd be good if they got quite a few seats and then they could do a
B	yes
A	erm
B	and people keep saying that you know look what happened when they had the council in Brighton the there was a huge mess in Brighton er
B	you know they couldn't get the rubbish cleared or anything
A	yeah
B	it's a very
A	yeah
B	I got it on Kindle so at least I can a lot of it's very boring
B	erm but I imagine the book must be this big erm so I I read through the whole war period which was rather terrifying I mean it was you know er he did he managed to survive that and then he decided after the war to
A	mm
B	early fifties I think haven't quite got to the early fifties yet erm and everything is political every time he eats a sandwich or takes a piss it's political one way or the other
A	yeah
B	it's
A	yeah I wonder if that's
A	in erm in the twentieth century
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	well it's difficult to know what politics means in the Middle East isn't it?
A	yeah
B	just pop into the studio
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	erm so now I want to get her I've got her bank
A	so you want to delete?
B	I'll show you let me just get in there er log in
A	wait wait
B	oh
A	er it doesn't
B	do I say okay?
A	yeah
B	right
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said if he log in he will show Person A how he can do things in the site	Entailment
A	mm
B	there are two
A	right
B	one is and they both are with me as well and I think that goes back to the
A	mm
B	could I delete?
A	I mean you could
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think Person B could delete it from his account	Entailment
A	what happens when you click on it?
B	doesn't say which account
A	tut yeah it's a bit of a
B	you see what I mean?
A	yeah but you couldn't just make a new one?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think he should make a new account to do what  he wants to do	Entailment
B	well if I do you see er then it says I've already got that I'll show you name of the person or company
A	no
B	it's a bank account so account number is
A	but you could do
B	I did that on the other one I could do
A	yeah
B	so I know it's new their account number is
A	add it
B	look see? you already have a payment instruction set up for this payee
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is not familiar with that application but he think add the new account number	Entailment
B	no that's exactly
B	right
A	first click cancel
B	cancel
B	but I didn't
[ANNOTATION]	Person B didn't do cancel it	Entailment
A	so erm one of those is the
B	I think so and I just don't know which I don't
A	I don't know how to edit to get into that list though that's the
B	it doesn't say delete does it?
A	yeah it'll be the same
B	be the same
A	I suppose what the one what you have to do is maybe just sort of do a transfer of sort of two pounds to both and see what what happens sort of communicate and then remember which is the right one
B	erm
A	yeah but if you just give so you just you give two pounds to both of the accounts and see which
B	ah which gets that's a good idea
A	and then er like call
B	so
A	but I dunno if you would need to do it sort of
B	shall I do it one at a time?
A	yeah I think so let's make a
B	make a note
A	and then ask
B	yes so it's being sent to
A	mm
B	she won't be thrilled to get two pounds
B	next
A	wait wait actually this is useful
B	ah
A	because it tells you er when you click next which is which so that's the right one
B	do you think that's the right one?
A	cos it's the same as this right?
B	yes ah it is isn't it?
A	so so maybe if you just
B	oh yes okay maybe they're both okay now who knows? alright so this is
A	yeah
A	see that's something else
B	that's something else
A	so that's the one you wanna remember
B	okay
A	not to send money to
B	that's great so that's brilliant erm now if I could mark that and write something on it no I can't
A	I mean there must be a way to remove people from that list
A	no that won't work
B	no it doesn't delete
A	maybe if I just do a quick Google search er it'll tell me
B	okay do a quick
A	yeah
B	at least I've got that
A	erm down
A	deleting this one?
B	we're deleting that
A	how do I know
B	that that one we're deleting
A	right
B	great alright that's wonderful thenI'll I'll do it all later thank you
A	that's alright
B	erm
A	mm
B	except when we discussed it was the origin of er the line
A	line yeah
B	line drawing and this is he's he's done these erm
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	this sort of size and then I emailed him to say that I'd been and er and and mentioned this and then he wrote this morning erm he er says it it
B	er
A	er shadow in general?
B	cos I said erm da da da da
A	erm I dunno if I I think I just showed you where where it was cos I haven't read that before
B	oh oh maybe you gave me a reference that's possible so he's taken that he's not saying it's the first line but it's the shadows
A	but er yeah yeah it is er cos I think I remember that that one thing I er talking to you about was sort of who could was who could draw the thinnest line
B	yes
B	yes
A	tried to get the other artist to open the curtain that was a painting
B	yes yes
A	erm
B	well I'll show you a fine line I've just I'm doing these new paintings of
A	yeah I quite like them
B	what?
A	I quite like them
B	yes people do seem to respond to them
A	yeah
B	that's what I'm not certain about I actually think it's better without I made a technical mistake so I am rectifying it by doing the second one and I don't think it quite works
A	yeah it might be one division but I feel like it when it's sort of barely discernible shades
B	yes
A	if you see what so I sort of I I think er I would like it better as a mix of that and that if you see so one line but closer tones
B	closer tones than these?
A	yeah
B	okay well I think I've got to destroy this and do another one so I think that if I can locate the paper cut-outs that's probably what I will do
A	I like this one too
B	yeah I think I I think that's good I
A	yeah
B	I also rather like that one erm I'm I'm I'm enjoying doing these and
B	and it's true cos there is a narrative element cos I'm doing so badly professionally and I thought I might as well do paintings nobody can see
B	erm if they're not gonna look at them anyhow they might mean er just as well be nothing for them to see okay let's go
A	er that's nice I really like that I think that's a nice
B	yes yes
A	that's good
B	I'm pleased cos I'm oh I've got to choose a load to show at the
B	and then one of those horrible art fairs erm
A	yeah she said actually
B	what do you think of him?
A	he's alright
B	no better than that?
A	yeah I dunno I
B	oh god I you I'll cut it in half shall I
B	yes go on
A	erm I don't I think he's sort of he's not really used to like
B	ah is that right?
A	I think
B	does he?
A	I think so
B	this is not sibling jealousy of mum's new boyfriend?
A	no cos it's like well cos it was always
B	I know but they were children
B	I mean now she's got a real bloke
A	yeah
B	I have to admit I really took to him
A	yeah he is he is charming
B	he's he's charming he's he's bright isn't he?
A	yeah
B	but what I don't know and of course you know your mum she won't tell me anything erm
A	right
B	which I have to say is er rather sensible if you can afford to do it erm do you want some bread as well?
A	erm no I think I'm alright
B	no? here's a bit of salad
A	thank you
A	sure
B	here we are
A	thanks
B	and then I've got some little chocolate creams for for afterwards erm so he's not interested in in you and
A	well
B	no
B	I mean that has really surprised me
B	well he said he grew up erm in a community in I think either
A	in
B	and I wanna know what he does that's what I want to know and I I couldn't quite be rude enough to say what do you actually do?
A	yeah I don't really know
B	you don't know?
B	yes I did
B	that was clever wasn't it?
A	erm cos I know he has quite sort of quite a lot of property and things
B	so he's quite rich?
A	I think so
B	well I tell you what good for your mum
A	yeah well his house in in you know is really big and nice
B	in
A	yeah
B	is that right?
A	sort of round just round the corner
B	oh really?
A	with like with like a huge garden and
B	is that right?
B	the children to tell me erm
B	cos he's a
A	mm
B	well it can't be easy for you and
A	what's that about
B	well I think er
A	yeah
B	you know they're both both
A	what is what is
B	yes he's got he's doing something
A	yeah
B	erm and to go to however many
A	yeah
B	but it I mean it's been great the places you've been to
A	mm
B	and somewhere else but I think he may be waiting to hear if he's got into
A	it'll be good to go for him to go to South America probably
B	yeah I mean if he goes somewhere like Peru
A	just to Mexico yeah
B	right mm
A	erm went to er started off in a place called erm
B	oh right
A	and er sort of lots of like bit
B	right
A	sort of lots of like quite a lot of
B	oh yeah
B	and what do they do? just hang around?
B	oh
A	because there's silver mines there and the silver's really cheap
B	ah
A	a really special kind of silver
B	is it?
A	so I
B	did you bring some back?
A	no
B	and they sell this
A	I think so yeah
B	well
A	and it's sort of
B	right
A	sort of launch operations from
B	and how far from Mexico City?
A	erm it's about three hours north
B	right
A	it's nice because it's really hot in the day and then cooler in the evenings
B	oh that's lovely
A	and then we rented a car and sort of drove to the coast to a place called
B	mm
A	erm
B	how nice that there still are such places
A	on the sort of on the Pacific coast
B	who did you go with? remind me
A	went with
A	which is erm like a friend
B	that sounds really great
A	it was good
B	and was it expensive?
A	no really cheap everything was cheap
B	cos there's nowhere cheap in Europe left is there? not really
A	mm
B	is East Berlin still cheap?
A	probably in the outskirts of Berlin like
B	mm
A	and Athens maybe
B	ah but you haven't been to Peru?
A	no
B	no
A	in Mexico?
B	yeah
A	yeah there's lots of
B	oh yes they're wonderful
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talkin about Chinese	Contradiction
B	they're cleaning those all up now aren't they?
A	it's strange cos it's very like it's obviously it's very sort of Catholic but it's like infused with er something really sort of pagan it's like it's like really kind of pagan quality of Catholicism and very like strange really colourful like in a church there'll be sort of
B	yeah
A	erm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about sky	Contradiction
B	well I suppose that is exactly what it is it's a
A	mm
B	plus their own
B	oh really?
A	and pretending to be sort of Virgil erm
B	really?
B	I must say they were absolutely vile
A	yeah
B	I suppose it's different now
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	no kind of a nuisance
B	yeah
A	actually I sort of
B	well I mean do think you've got a talent? I mean you taught yourself Greek if you have a talent you can probably
A	mm
B	teach yourself
A	yeah well I I mean I know I don't really know German but I can talk it yeah
A	no I did it did it in school for GCSE but I would struggle to read a German newspaper you know
B	German is terribly difficult erm
A	yeah
B	and you never did any French?
A	not in school
[ANNOTATION]	they don't know which language is difficult	Neutral
A	yeah I dunno I mean I did when I was with the other
B	mm
A	like in
B	it's it's yes and also they're rude they're not if you if you go to Italy and just say good evening they they say oh you know your Italian's so wonderful
B	but I think you can
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure can speak italy	Neutral
A	yeah
B	er they are er it is astonishing I'm not sure
A	mm
B	are you at home in all those languages?
A	yeah it's interesting er I I remember sort of reading something about being bilingual sort of er
B	well words sound the same
A	mm
B	which means flesh
A	yeah
B	one word
B	but then that might be to do with how used to one is to
A	yeah
B	if you make a mistake and you say oh shit but if you say
A	well yeah cos the interesting thing this I
B	yes
A	where in English people say both probably because the German one is more
B	yes no they wouldn't say shit
A	but an English person might well say
B	do you think?
A	yeah
B	no why would they?
A	no? just er they cos
B	only educated people like you
A	no I er you know I on even on like TV and stuff I've seen people
B	it's true when I was young
A	yeah
B	I haven't heard that for years
A	mm maybe the top half of it
B	it's got chilli and tomatoes on and I'm not
A	erm
B	well I think
A	no I mean I
B	I mean to learn to speak it really really well that's another thing
A	I find it easier actually to
B	my mother used to
A	mm
B	erm and then er also you need to so much you know we don't have grammar in in English do we? so it's quite difficult to
A	yeah
B	I suppose you grasped that through Greek and Latin
A	well yeah
B	it's a what?
B	what is?
A	English
B	English
A	as in sort of ending so long
B	yes
B	mm who's ringing at lunchtime? hello?
B	ah er er Tuesday I think
A	I haven't seen her for a while
B	no but maybe in the summer we'll do a family party shall we? erm
B	is he living in your house now?
A	I don't really know
B	you don't know?
A	I mean he has a house round the corner but I think he
B	right
A	erm
B	no point having a house that's not lived in
A	I'm just gonna get some water do you want some?
B	erm no but you can make yourself some more tea if you want? put the kettle on
A	I'll have
B	if you er water's in the jug in the fridge
A	yeah I mean there is
B	do you have time for that?
A	yeah probably
B	I mean the thing about French or German of course is you can er you learn it and then you go there
A	yeah
B	and you go there with no English-
A	yeah
B	where you're supposed to talk and that really makes a huge difference
A	yeah
B	you still don't eat your crusts
A	er
A	everybody sort of knows enough English to get by with each other
B	everybody knows enough English to get by that's right but I mean I'm sure you could find something for a short period some sort of relatively easy job erm
A	no I
B	are you? oh right
B	perhaps you've got over your majorly eating
B	although not er
B	I mean it's impossible to get you know he can just eat so much
B	but he's very big
A	that's good
B	he didn't get it to his annoyance but er it's good to be shortlisted
A	yeah I mean I had a I had a language program on the computer which was good for French
B	right
A	I
B	oh right
A	but like
B	what languages does he speak?
A	he speaks
B	French? German?
A	well he speaks I mean he doesn't really speak German but he speaks French erm and like
B	was he? yes
A	cos he knows
B	well I told you about my dad who knew Latin not Italian just spoke Latin with Italian endings and
A	I'm going to erm
B	are you?
A	in a few weeks yeah
B	where?
A	erm first to Rome and then to to er
B	oh
A	I've never really been
B	you've never been?
A	just drove through it one for one day once yeah
B	it's just there's nothing like Italy it is a magical place Rome so you're
A	mm
B	and you walk a lot er make sure you have really comfortable shoes and a change of shoes erm
A	erm I'm going with
B	oh great great
A	everyone's going
B	oh that'll be lovely well there's a lot of stuff to see in Rome erm
A	yeah I think we're only gonna be in Rome
B	right well you won't see it all then
A	and then
B	and how far is this place from Rome?
A	in Tuscany? I don't know actually how far away it is
B	Tuscany's quite a way up probably about six hours' drive
A	yeah
B	yes
A	mm
B	erm and then that's such a beautiful language
B	what is
B	well you can learn
B	or
B	how about can you can you tell me the way to the post office?
A	there's no post offices
B	no of course not
A	where is the toilet?
B	course not
B	alright tell me something else er that I've never quite understood how did ancient Greece you know from which really every I mean that's what we're still living on in a way isn't it? culturally
A	yeah
B	well how
A	don't know really
A	no one knows I mean that's like why people are so fascinated by it
B	how was society set up? let I mean erm the peak of the the classical period is what year?
A	mm
B	four hundred and something?
A	like four fifties
B	four fifties well what about what was going on in five fifty?
A	in five fifty they were sort of laying the groundwork erm they had that guy called Solon who sort of laid down some democratic laws
B	oh did they?
A	and then they had a problem with sort of tyrants erm they couldn't really make democracy work until the fifth century until the two these two this sort of er
B	is that right?
A	that's really sort of where democracy in Athens comes from
B	how absolutely fascinating
B	what's his name?
A	erm the tyrant or the killers? they're called erm Harmodius is one of them and I can't remember the other one
B	right
A	but erm I mean there are statues of them but erm sort of the whole
A	because of because that's where the democracy came from sort of er an affair killing sort of
B	I've never heard that how fascinating
A	well it's not really it's just sort of
B	I mean I suppose it's not quite that simple
A	yeah that's like what I was
B	maybe it is
A	what I was writing about
B	so who were the couple?
A	erm they were sort of just
A	yeah I think so sort of aristocratic erm
B	yes
A	and one older man
B	right and they were a couple and then the they got fed up with the tyrant
A	yeah who was
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a doesn't know how to write	Contradiction
A	maybe that was part of it but also the main reason why they killed him was because the tyrant was just sort of trying to get off with the
B	with the younger one
A	with the younger one
B	oh didn't they?
A	it wasn't very I mean they did but it was
B	so that started also what? in the
A	yeah
B	fifth century?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a story	Entailment
A	about then yeah
B	maybe because there was some particularly skilled sculptors perhaps?
A	well no well I it's I mean er portraiture really becomes a thing er sort of in the Hellenistic period and it's interesting when er
B	and that isn't
A	yeah it sort of starts at three two three BC
B	yeah I see I mean that two hundred years is actually quite a long time
A	yeah
B	if one thinks of of being er well it is and it isn't erm
A	but yeah er
B	oh I see so erm and this was in Athens?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a loves the roman time period	Neutral
A	yeah
B	no of course not
A	it's in er it's
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b denies a statement	Entailment
B	erm do you think that it's possible that because those two were powerful they kind of er
A	in
B	it was always okay was it?
A	it was er it was what you're it was sort of it was the norm it wasn't sort of deviant or like different but it's only
B	how do we know this?
A	I I mean I don't know
A	erm well it's written down sort of about eight hundred BC
B	Homer was written at eight hundred BC? as early as that?
A	but I mean the stories are probably older
B	it is utterly fascinating isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	the stories they talk about are very recent	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	utterly fascinating cos we still don't really know how we emerged I mean the more and more
A	yeah
B	rather than evolve I mean have we evolved? psychologically we've certainly not evolved er for the better
A	mm yeah
B	er in some ways I mean there is an aspect of contemporary society where there is a place for empathy now in the last really since post-World War Two
[ANNOTATION]	they mention evolution	Entailment
A	yeah
B	but it's completely recent
A	I
B	yes
A	and those were the two sort of modes of life or sort of patterns of existence that people operate in
B	yeah
A	and they come from sort of two small places
B	well I think we think that it's still probably just slightly more human to have a life in the west if you can ignore all the hundreds of wars there have been I mean to me there is still something fairly horrendous about China I mean if you think of the lives that most sort of the Chinese must live now you know?
A	yeah
B	working fifteen sixteen hours a day for for a pittance so you you know now they're getting a a middle class and upper class but it does rather frighten me the thought a lot of artists are going over there and they usually have a horrible time
A	yeah I mean there's that erm I watched a quite good documentary about Apple and er sort of how they make their factories in China and stuff and they're just erm entire cities that are just factories sort of you live there and you work there with like twenty thousand people
B	apple like in apples?
A	like er
B	oh Apple computers
B	yes right oh really?
A	erm
B	they come from the countryside cos they can't manage to
A	make enough money yeah
B	make make enough money to live
A	there was this
B	it's very frightening
A	yeah there was did
B	I mean
A	yeah er
B	well with any luck it'll hold off for another ten years so that you and
B	yes but of course it's got nothing to do with it has it?
A	yeah nothing to do with it but it's just a sort of
A	especially when it's sort of talking being like
B	oh it's it's it's terrible
A	erm
B	there is er quite a well-known composer er I mean he's not so young anymore I don't know whether you've heard of him called
A	yeah
B	same thing
B	so he had it all done privately and it was an eight-hour operation he had a huge scar and one of his artists gave him as a present erm recuperation time in
A	mm
B	and there's another person very very wealthy art dealer called I've forgotten his name
B	and he wrote this book about it now what happened was I he came out of hospital and he recovered instantly
B	I mean fantastically strong man erm he's quite stocky not very tall
B	erm and I didn't go to see him for about two weeks and I went in there about twelve o'clock for
B	must you know they must have pumped him so full of drugs and he said terrible things happened to him you know in
B	and the they'd lay the table for dinner and he'd say no I don't like those glasses
B	I want different glasses and so at the same time as doing that he could also see himself doing it and understand how er ridiculous that was and erm so he he then wrote he wrote a book about it
B	and all the way through the dog through the
B	and I said I see that
B	er I thought that's true rather useful you might quite enjoy it
B	blah blah blah blah blah blah
B	so have a look so that's
A	yeah
B	I think you might enjoy it I'll see if I can get you an extra copy I think you'd find it funny
A	so it's recent erm
B	yes so it's all quite recent
A	that he went to
B	yeah
A	erm I watched the first two seasons it was
B	see I think it's er absolutely addictive luckily I haven't finished yet
B	erm apparently he is
A	yeah probably
B	I think anybody to be that successful don't you?
A	oh I haven't really heard from him
B	have you not?
A	I got a Christmas card I think
B	you wanna keep in touch with him he's a good contact
B	whatever you want to do later
B	you should keep in
A	yeah I mean it's hard I suppose it's just sort of hard to do it not really artificially
B	yes
A	yeah
B	and say er we haven't seen each other in so long just to say I hope that you're well I saw him on television the other day briefly and he looked very well
A	yeah er last time I saw him er he looks good for he's quite old now I suppose
B	yes he must be
A	yeah
B	erm of course from where I stand
B	but it is old but er he he seems quite vigorous
A	yeah
B	and he's on the radio every week and I think what he does is very good
A	the er the other week my erm I I
B	at
A	er yeah erm
B	how many tutorials do you get?
A	erm
B	well it's very nice that
A	and I
B	mm
A	but also any time you wanted sort of extra time you just sort of they would be they're really happy like willing to like to
B	oh it's very good that I mean at I don't know what art schools are like now most of them aren't like that but most of my teaching years we had long tutorials you know at least an hour and I
A	mm
B	and that's very that's very rewarding I mean one of the great things about that kind of relationship is you actually can talk about what you're interested in
A	yeah
B	you know I mean artists don't talk about art when they're together they they er they complain about their dealers or they talk about money
A	yeah
B	sometimes they talk about technique but they don't talk about art
B	so presumably it's the same you're not gonna be talking about classics with your mates
A	yeah no
B	so it's it is very very nice that was always what I liked about teaching
A	yeah
B	I mean that's I think one of the problems that's happened everything is now so enormous and everybody's in touch with everybody
A	yeah
B	I mean I'm sure there's some very good things about it but
A	yeah it's er it's lots er sort of er
B	yes
A	kinda cos I think erm I I even I even I can sort of remember just sort of looking at photos and books of other places you know that were sort of like exciting and when you're a child it's like imagine
B	yes
A	but now it's sort of that's would be totally
B	yeah I think that's that's a problem I mean when I er er started travelling just in Europe it was very exciting but when I then went somewhere like Morocco mind you I suspect there are still places in in
A	yeah
B	especially in North Africa where modern life hasn't really impinged
A	I don't know
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has visited Egypt	Neutral
B	and that did look very bizarre
A	yeah even things like telephones sort of er like the world before the telephone
B	half the time you didn't know where anybody was
B	well even in in my childhood
A	yeah
B	it was it was very expensive to phone I used to go up you remember in
A	yeah
B	that was my father's room and I used to go up to phone my friends in the evenings and after five minutes my father'd roar up that's enough
B	you er I'm not made of money
B	cos it was very expensive
B	I'm working on trying to get
B	he's moved up two paces
B	ah yes
A	and so that's why they're able to sort of give sort of
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	using the phone was almost free	Contradiction
A	but they had picked up all all the sort of chit-chat from the whole sort of Greek world
B	terribly hard to imagine living like that now there is a movement er have you ever met my photographer called
A	yeah
B	and I'm I'm interested in reading it cos I can't imagine how that can happen
A	yeah
B	you know and you've got no television you've got no radio you've got no telephone you've got no way of communicating you've got no way of seeing in the evening erm you've got no way of heating you've got no way of cooking
B	it's extraordinary
A	yeah
B	I'm amazed that no country's managed to do it yet I suppose that there are firewalls everywhere
[ANNOTATION]	imagining the situation is not easy	Entailment
A	mm
B	absolutely
A	yeah
B	only recently wasn't there some enormous storm somewhere in Australia or off on an island off? where everything everything crashed
B	would you like to read a story I wrote about an experience of
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a does not agree with speaker b's explanations	Contradiction
B	and all about how he was
B	would you like me to send it to you?
A	yeah I
B	it's it you may find it it well it it is it is boring you know I mean that's the point to it erm but it's er
A	but it's a sort of bureaucratic nightmare?
B	yes yes I've called it erm renewing your passport roll over Franz Kafka
B	and in fact I'm starting to think about
A	yeah
B	and if it's
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b will send it to speaker a	Entailment
A	yeah I wish I
A	they didn't really know like they had to say
B	yeah that's the kind of thing that you know everybody's got one or two stories like that at some point
A	well I think I'd better start
B	okay
[ANNOTATION]	they were not sure what had to be said	Entailment
A	that's alright
B	erm
A	erm go back to
B	oh quite a quite a long time
A	is
B	I er saw her a little while ago erm
A	yeah
B	and you can probably interest each other in various things anyhow it's lovely to see you
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B have never seen her	Contradiction
B	see you soon
A	yeah see you soon
B	and love to the family
A	yep
B	and make allowances for
B	goodbye
[ANNOTATION]	they continue talking	Contradiction
