C	oh
C	I've just got the wrong one then
A	she doesn't like cheap clothes but she's not particularly bothered about designer names she just likes quality rather than
C	ah
D	Marks and Spencers
A	yeah yeah
C	I was just thinking about a designer handbag but I suppose you couldn't really get much with a hundred and ten pounds could you?
A	mm hates handbags
C	oh
B	what does she use?
A	she just carries the tiniest little thing she says she doesn't like handbags cos she doesn't like carrying anything on her
B	I guess that's fair enough like I understand that
A	so she's got a really tiny handbag just for things like keys and
B	yeah I can understand that actually
D	so what did you get for Christmas this year? I mean
A	I don't well I got perfume so that's er

B	yeah
A	mind you
B	they get slowly bigger
A	you should have kept them because you'll
D	they were snug Uggs
A	because you'll tread the sheep the the wool down and then they
C	well I
A	get a bit big
C	yeah and I
D	yeah we did hum and ha about that
C	I did hum and haring about that
D	but I er I
A	cos that's well that's
D	well I had to do the same with them I had to take them back and get a bigger size
C	oh
D	so erm
B	oh
C	but they were quite narrow on my foot
A	oh right ooh
D	see she said
B	sorry
D	she wanted slippers

B	you've got loads of perfume
A	yeah I like perfume
B	mm
A	Paco Rabanne Diamonds that's all we bought each other we were very restrained
C	yeah but that's really expensive isn't it?
A	I think it's more expensive than his jumper
C	yeah
A	but
C	beside
A	mm yeah
C	and he he said oh I like that
D	million? million?
C	Millions for Men
A	yeah
C	isn't it? you know
A	yeah
C	Paco Rabanne and it
A	yeah I know cos I
B	oh
A	said to
C	yeah
A	or the Diamonds and I can't remember who makes the Diamonds got that the wrong way round and I think the Diamonds was marginally cheaper so I got that
C	yeah I mean it was reduced you know after Christmas
A	mm
C	but yeah fifty-seven pound
A	I know it's a lot of money for perfume isn't it?
B	but it does make you smell good
D	but I would have stuck to the budget but I I because I've had my computer and I've had to get myself a new computer
A	mm did you? what instead of your
D	I just I just feel
A	erm Mac?
C	no
D	no no this is a desktop
A	oh right oh
D	it's a standalone desktop
A	right right
D	erm

A	oh yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and is it good?
C	yeah well I've had a
A	oh
C	it's good you know so far
A	mm
C	I think you've gotta sort of like cream your feet a little bit afterwards and keep doing it you know?
D	and
A	yeah
C	yeah well
D	at Christmas Eve that we'd both bought
C	like I don't know if it was the twenty-
A	oh so what did you do?
C	I think it was the twenty-third
A	yeah
C	cos we got paid on the twenty-third
A	yeah
C	and erm she texted me and says
C	I sort of thought er
A	mm
C	I didn't know how much it was I
A	mm
C	so don't get it but
A	oh so what did you do take one back?
C	yeah
D	well she'd bought a box set version and mine was just the
A	right what was the difference?
D	well
C	well
D	about half the price on that one
A	yeah but what was in that one that?
D	erm
C	well
A	oh
C	and
A	so did you keep that one?
C	no
A	oh that
C	that's the one I didn't keep
A	mm
C	because I didn't think really and truly I would
A	mm
C	use it
A	so what did erm
D	and I think also the fact that she thought if I was to take this back it'll go back into her account and then that's where it'll stay
A	oh so she hasn't got you anything else as a
C	well she
C	well she
A	replacement?
C	she got

D	a bit bigger?
C	well sort of
D	no she was
C	biggish
D	oh

A	yeah he did he
D	I remember you telling me
A	yeah there was something I can't remember all the story now
D	maybe it was like
A	yeah but
D	yeah
A	but there was something but I think he exacerbated it rather than caused it
D	oh that's right no wasn't it something someone said something to his missus about his missus or to his missus?
A	oh that's it yeah and he he said she was
D	yeah
A	something gave her a compliment or something
D	yeah
A	and he got all jealous and stupid

B	oh yeah
A	and she used to lie
B	yeah I remember it yeah
A	and actually in
D	and blamed

A	because she was there I think and she was one of the friends and
D	someone's fault other than his little precious
A	yeah it's someone's fault
B	oh
A	and erm
C	she is someone you could blame though isn't she
A	yes
A	but for once in her life actually
C	yeah
A	she'd got there very very late
B	anyway how were her friends meant to control what
C	no I know it's ridiculous
A	oh yeah and then he said
C	because
B	what a stupid thing to do
