A	have you seen this in the village newsletter about Halloween and children
B	oh I don't know
A	well there was none here was there?
B	well there must've been reason for
A	oh no they're just being
B	well they've gone and dropped it somewhere else obviously
C	no
A	we had
A	well if they'd given them some sweeties they might not've dropped it there I suppose
B	oh you think it was in a revenge attack?
A	I think
A	yeah
B	he didn't have a pipe and cigarette in erm in his mouth er
A	yeah?
A	yeah?
B	he was a he was a
A	oh well how did he know your dad then?
B	er er well through
A	mm
B	but he knew him
A	so who had that farm before the
B	it belonged
A	so it was
B	because he didn't have any family
A	yeah?
B	he left it to
A	him
B	in trust
A	that was lucky wasn't it?
B	well it was very nice
A	very nice
B	very nice for him
A	yeah cos it's a good farm that
B	but I don't know if
A	well good buildings
B	don't know who
A	well he was
B	whether it was
A	it
B	and he he was like talking as if I
A	yeah
B	so I couldn't really
B	well he would be
A	I like that name though for him Mr
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	cos it suits him as well
B	well he would be
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	that
A	mm
B	from years gone by
A	mm
B	so he was probably it's probably he was probably
A	mm
B	well it sounds like
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
A	mm
B	when you've got three young sons
A	mm
B	who are keen
A	mm
B	obviously they're going to
A	they
B	no but they've a big contracting business
A	do they?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	they do a
B	do a heck of a lot of contracting beside farming
A	mm I didn't know
B	so there'll be plenty of work for
A	well there will but
B	plenty of work for three of them
A	on big machinery
B	with
A	mm
B	well in fact there must be more than work for three of them because they do I think they employ
A	do they?
B	down there as well
A	wonder if that
B	well
A	yeah
B	they'll have three houses then
A	yeah
B	it'll be three houses
A	and three
B	well
A	we're still one short
B	at
A	mm
B	we'll have to find another
A	with all that development up at
B	there's possibilities
A	probably
A	mm
A	mm
A	oh you think they've got one?
B	now whether
A	mm
B	and they're developing the other end of it
A	mm
B	I don't know them that well
A	they do don't they?
B	well yeah they've
A	mm
B	which goes with it and if there was two hundred acres there
A	yeah
B	plus their own
A	mm
B	they obviously have quite a bit of land to go at
A	mm
A	they zero graze them all?
B	the milk cows are all zero graze
A	oh it's a shame isn't it?
A	oh I think it's er it's well it's a shame when they don't go out in the fields at all
B	they don't get lanes yeah
A	I wondered what I why I was I's never been
B	they don't get er
A	no but they can't enjoy it as much
B	they do enjoy it more
B	they're under cover they they can walk around
A	yeah but in summer they'd prefer to be out it can be hot and stuffy and horrible
B	well I think
A	surely?
B	but I think probably when they're in calf for a period
A	mm
B	they'll probably
A	mm
A	mm
B	zero grazed
A	mm
B	everything's carted to them
A	yeah
A	they're a bit
B	yeah they're not
A	they really were
B	I don't think
A	I think we might look at
B	we've been spoilt
C	mm
A	I think we might look at an artificial
C	no I like a real tree
B	an artificial one is is the most sensible thing to do
C	there's nothing like a real tree though is there?
A	I know but it's the heated floor they don't survive
B	yeah and it just takes
A	well there's
B	and they're very good
A	mm
B	they're very good now
A	mm
B	they used to be bit of a
B	but it's not the really the right time of year to be finding it
A	no I don't no it's not er
B	Easter might be better
A	no we're
B	perhaps we should wait till Easter
A	no
B	we shall might find a
A	we're not we're
B	a bargain
A	we're not having a second hand one I can tell you
B	doesn't matter does it?
A	yes of course it
A	and at least the needles
A	mm
B	really good one
A	no
B	would be ideal
A	definitely not
B	well
A	there's somebody
C	goodness me
B	mm
A	gracious
B	going to be on the map is
A	yeah
B	fancy
A	mm
B	you could probably attend
A	mm
B	it might be sold out
B	what?
B	no?
A	at
C	oh that would be good I could take
A	mm
B	what's the other one that's on at er?
A	that would be nice
B	at
B	where
A	oh I don't know that's
B	panto
A	that's
B	was it
B	yep
A	I don't know what they're putting on it just said
B	well you did because you read it out
A	oh did I?
B	yeah
A	I've forgotten now
C	why? what did we go and see at
B	well
A	mm
B	Christmas pantomime on
C	we've never been to one though
B	no
A	no
B	but we haven't been er to any
A	mm
B	they say he's very funny
A	mm
B	with Mr
A	well he's funny when he's not performing
A	so I don't know what he'd be like when he is
B	mm
C	what are
A	oh The Nutcracker
B	what? both of them?
A	no it's just
B	I think they should be thinking about
A	you know it's not
B	about little
A	oh
C	yeah
A	so
A	no
B	it's hard to get your head round what they're
C	and did they find out who
B	yeah that's
C	oh right
B	she put it onto her
A	but why shoot
B	and they've left they've gone off
A	people with disabilities?
B	they've shot all them innocent people
A	mm mm
B	a six months old
A	mm
B	it's just absolute madness it's like they get possessed
A	mm
B	and I don't know I don't understand how you can
A	well they're not independent
B	if they start doing that in America it's going to be very simple because
A	mm
B	there's guns and bombs and all sorts of
A	well I'm sure anybody would
B	killing machines in America that are available to the
A	I'm sure anybody who really wants a gun can get one here
B	yeah but
A	obviously
B	the harder you make it the better
A	mm
B	just go
A	it's easy
B	you can't here
A	easy enough to make bombs here isn't it? you can get all the
C	yeah definitely
A	mm
B	eh?
A	easy enough to make bombs here
B	oh yeah I mean you can make bombs if you're
A	and now they can make those 3D guns can't they?
C	I haven't heard about them
A	but I don't but I don't understand
B	well I don't know that sounds a bit stupid to me
[ANNOTATION]	3D guns don't exist yet.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	yeah
C	what? like a cardboard one?
A	well no it won't be it
B	no that's no good
A	it would be a bit
C	yeah like the printing machines?
A	yeah
C	yeah I don't
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A knows what a printing machine is.	Entailment
A	3D printing machines somehow they can
B	it's an awful
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	3D printing machines are about to go in the market.	Contradiction
B	I mean unless you're gonna
A	yes but then again I think you've got to
B	well what? like er a disability school?
A	mm no well well no
C	mm
B	that's
A	but surely
B	that's not exactly a hotspot
A	I mean I cannot understand that at all
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has some difficulties in grasping what speaker B mentions.	Contradiction
B	well that's what I mean it that's not exactly a hotspot
A	I cannot understand it
B	is a caf√©
A	well central Paris
B	you can understand big gatherings
B	you know football matches and
A	mm
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A mentioned a European capital.	Entailment
B	but
A	mm
B	anywhere's a possibility
A	well why did they pick on that school? because he'd worked there? or? what was it in the end?
B	they're not bothered who they pick on that's what I'm saying
A	yes I know but I'm saying
B	well yeah they would know the layout and
A	or was one of them
B	yeah
A	I haven't I haven't heard haven't read a lot about it
B	think so
B	it was his
A	mm
B	yeah I think he did didn't he? I think he worked there but I mean it was easy
A	yeah
B	the face fitted
A	but
B	no they'd been they'd been
A	was there some extra
B	he was involved in some sort of an institution that was connected
A	mm
B	and
A	mm?
B	and left
A	mm?
B	and then come back
A	mm
B	and then just willy nilly
B	started shooting everybody
A	disgusting
C	mm
B	mm
A	unbelievable
B	the intention of doing something
A	they were ready to attack somewhere
B	yeah
A	but that er just fuelled
B	and er
A	that fuelled it
B	that was that which was a terrible carry on
A	mm
B	but
C	mm
A	yeah
B	the killing of a lot of innocent people but they were they
B	this is
A	mm
B	is this ISIS
A	although it's not
B	no but it's the reasons for it it's the it's
A	I know it's the reaons for it as well
B	difficult to
A	but it
B	I think the only reason that
A	although the end result is I suppose
B	I think the only reason their
A	mm
B	and they're losing hundreds and
A	thousands
B	through not not purposely but
A	mm
B	cos er they're not bothered who it is they kill as long as they're not
A	but there was that
B	I think that
A	they got on a farm
B	I think that was
C	oh yeah well
A	mm
C	and the police went round to have a look at it
C	and it turned out that they were involved in the
A	bombings
B	mm it was a training camp
C	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah it was a training camp
B	but that that was er
A	mm
B	and Al Qaeda and all them but
A	mm
B	well yeah I mean this beheading and just
A	oh
B	and
A	I know
B	trying to help
A	yeah
B	this
A	oh dreadful
B	it's just merciless it's just
A	mm
B	beggars belief
A	mm
B	so they're they're worse than
A	mm
B	I mean I don't know who's
A	well I don't think you'd be in rush
B	no but as a as a country going over to help another country
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you don't know who you're backing
A	well it's very sad that it's misused in that way but it's very helpful to a lot of people isn't it?
B	well it's
A	it's helps a lot of people religion
B	it bloody killed a lot and all over the years hasn't it?
A	but
B	well it has over the years
A	yeah
B	on the back of
A	mm
B	I I don't know how you can
C	mm
B	and I would ban religion
A	well I don't think you can actually
B	that's the first thing to do
A	I don't think you can actually do that can you?
B	ban all religion
B	well
A	it does do a lot of good I mean it's a big social thing in this village isn't it?
B	it isn't a big social thing at all in this village it's virtually dead
A	well for for the
C	well there's more going to the church than the pub now I think
A	yeah
B	well that's not saying much is it?
B	that's not saying very much
B	I think the pub would probably have a better chance of revival than the church actually if it got a decent landlord
A	mm
B	but I don't think it would happen the same if you got a decent vicar
B	loads of people don't go to that church
A	mm
B	and I don't see how you've
A	mm
B	they did not
A	yes there's plenty of people go to that church they've got the little groups there
B	why?
A	well because of your attitudes
A	I don't think they'd want to mix with you
A	but they're all people who are
C	yeah there does
A	than men
B	I don't know what they
A	they have the boys' group boys' brigade
B	yeah I think that's been reasonably popular has boys' brigade
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	it certainly wouldn't for me anyhow
A	well it would to a lot of people in the village I
B	yeah well I'm a I'm a great believer in live and let live but erm
A	yeah
B	but
A	I mean
B	it's been a
A	I mean there was a
B	well I suppose it is a bit hypocritical to want to have your
A	it is a bit
B	child christened if you're not religious
A	yeah I could never understand people wanting to have their children christened when they didn't go to church but
B	well I suppose from the church's point of view if they did christen them there's no there's no reason to say that that child might not be
A	no I think they
B	and they might take a dim view of the fact that they weren't allowed to be christened
A	well they can be christened later I mean I think
B	well they can
A	I think they should make their own minds up when they're
B	well it's probably a better idea
A	mm
C	mm
A	mm
B	I think people should
A	mm
C	what? they're not going to have religious studies anymore?
B	well I think
A	mm
C	no but the whole point of religious studies is that you learn about all different
B	well that's
A	mm
B	but on the other hand
B	you start going to
A	yes but there's so many links aren't there?
B	start going to Christian
A	yeah
B	they're not gonna start
A	no
B	they're not gonna do it
A	I don't think so
B	they're not
A	mm
B	if you're gonna teach religion it should be all religions
C	yeah mm
A	I know
B	mm
A	so he felt he'd missed out in that way although
B	well I can't ever remember being
A	well that's because you didn't go to
B	I did go to school
A	you didn't go to Sunday school when your father sent you that's why
B	oh well I mean that's that's different I mean
A	mm
B	that's different
A	did they?
B	there wasn't much
B	about other religions
A	no
B	spoken about at school
A	but you go to
B	well yeah you had a bit of church
A	mm
B	because it was a Church Of England school
A	mm
B	but I don't believe in that you see because that
A	mm
B	you know they're they're pushing their well they're pushing their own
A	mm
B	if you're gonna
A	mm
B	it's their choice
A	absolutely
B	who they
A	as they grow older
B	who they go with
A	mm
B	none
A	mm
B	my opinion
A	where did your mum and dad get married?
B	probably here
A	probably at
B	or maybe at
A	mm
A	but they're but they're
B	yeah
A	church is that?
B	well er it
A	ah
B	it was a parish
A	but is that a Church Of England church where they are?
B	where?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but er
A	mm
B	I think
A	did they?
B	yeah I think they were married at
A	mm
A	no
B	don't
A	well you'll have to work out what you're doing about that party won't you?
C	what party's that?
A	mm
C	oh right
B	sixtieth
A	mm
C	have I been invited?
B	party
B	but there might be ones attending that I don't want to see
C	yeah
A	mm
C	who's that?
A	mm
B	I daren't mention names
A	mm queen bee
C	yeah
B	but if they're going to be there I I
C	yeah mm
B	so
A	mm
C	mm
B	I mean I
A	anyone
B	sixtieth seventieth
A	no
B	fiftieth
A	you didn't have anything did you?
B	so
A	no
B	I'm not really all that fussed about it to be honest
A	mm
B	christening
A	oh you always
B	that's different
A	yes
B	but
A	yeah
B	you'd never be at home if you went to everbody's fiftieth and sixtieth bloody anniversaries
A	yeah
B	good grief
A	that was a nice one at erm
B	whose?
A	erm
B	oh at
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah when I was brought up as a little er kid with
A	yeah
B	in the same village
A	that was a good do wasn't it?
B	well
A	yeah nice to see people
B	who?
B	oh yeah
B	er
A	mm
C	yeah
A	isn't it?
C	yeah
B	yeah on your hundredth birthday
A	yeah
B	er
A	you're hoping you'll miss that aren't you?
C	how old are you this year?
C	no
A	seventy-four
B	I've got to the age where I've forgotten
B	which is only a pup these days
A	mm
B	I'll play football again this season though
A	no
B	I might well unless I go into defence
A	no golf tomorrow
B	there won't be any golf tomorrow
A	mm
C	why?
A	weather warnings it's er heavy rain and high winds
B	there's a big there's a big erm
A	not going anywhere tomorrow
B	there's a big
A	yeah
B	it has a name but I've forgotten it
A	have they named it now? because they hadn't named it just a little while ago it wasn't named
B	and er
A	yeah
B	and in
A	ah
B	cos it gives
B	mm
C	what does red alert actually mean?
A	oh very very high risk
B	well very dangerous
A	but they've got heavy
B	they've already
A	the
B	had floods and
A	yeah they got heavy floods in
B	mm
A	but the river was very high today wasn't it?
B	where?
A	you know the little
B	that wasn't high it was low in fact
A	oh it wasn't low
B	it was
A	rubbish
B	it was halfway down the
A	it wasn't
B	it was
A	did you?
B	yeah it was very low
A	oh I thought it was quite high I thought it was touching the tops
B	no the
A	mm
B	no
A	mm?
B	but I was surprised how low
A	mm
B	cos we have had a lot of rain
A	mm
B	are so much quicker
A	comes
B	yeah so it floods quick but it goes quick
A	yeah
B	whereas
A	yeah
B	when I was
A	mm
B	so it isn't
A	yes
A	no
B	it just doesn't work like that
A	mm
B	also
A	mm
B	so er
B	overall it's a very bad thing
A	but they still have a lot of flooding up in
B	well you'll always get it on the plains won't you?
A	mm
A	well there's all the flood defences isn't there in?
B	well there's stops
B	there's tidal defences but it's
A	mm
B	it copes I don't know it copes all the way up the
A	well there's some areas
B	yeah but I don't think that's anything to do with the
A	but
B	no
A	we'll have to look it up
B	I mean they've talked about areas like
A	mm
B	er
A	mm
B	but that's nothing to do with the
A	no
B	but
A	yeah
B	so it's not too difficult to
A	it's just going back
B	revert back to
A	mm
B	to er easy to
A	mm
B	yes where it's
A	mm
B	coastlines go
A	coastlines go
B	yeah the lower coastlines
A	mm
B	go
A	and even the higher ones
B	wherever there's
A	mm
B	they're like
A	well where where are the
B	don't know
A	I think there's some area up there where they're not defending it they're just
B	I've got no idea I mean it's
A	mm
B	which er
A	mm
B	I think er
A	see that's what with
B	oh yeah it's not particularly boggy in
A	has it?
B	and
A	mm
B	that was kept dry
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	which is quite easy to keep dry but
A	mm
B	well it's many hundreds of years ago isn't it?
A	is it? is it that long?
B	mm
A	mm
B	those flat lying areas are
B	well it might've done
A	well it must've done cos that was
B	but probably
A	where the dock was
B	er er before that
A	yeah
B	it would be flood plain up here
A	yeah
B	but er
A	mm
B	when they started
A	yeah
B	and then there's all
A	yeah
B	river
A	yeah
B	that's all very flat
A	and gravel
B	that'd be all flood plains
A	that's why
B	yeah
A	that they took out
B	yeah
A	but the same with
B	yeah
A	been
B	all
A	right through and that'd be right through to
B	yeah
B	well that would be the river whatsit?
A	that's the
A	where's that one come out?
B	past er
A	big castle place?
B	er
A	that's the
B	no
A	you mean
B	no
A	oh
B	the
A	yeah the
B	that goes past the the
A	yes?
B	goes through the paperworks
A	it does and past
B	I mean at at
A	yeah
B	at
A	mm
A	oh
A	oh
B	that's
B	mm
A	well it goes out to the estuary at
B	yes but I I'm just
B	inland it goes
B	well the falls those falls that you we go and see sometimes
A	the water
B	mm
A	yeah the salmon jump
A	I don't know is it?
B	think so
A	no
B	at one time there might've been
A	yeah
B	it'd be a big area of water
A	it would it would
B	the
A	yeah
B	big areas of water
A	it wouldn't need much would it?
B	no
A	well look at that
B	where?
B	oh going
B	going towards
A	oh right going towards
B	going towards
A	so
B	yes cos they found a big boulder in it or something
A	did they? that had been just left?
B	well it had dropped in or caved in and it it was er
A	yeah
B	a big
A	well
B	now
A	but I know that day I was trying to
B	you probably got towed in
A	towed in?
B	your car conked you
A	oh was I?
B	jammed it all up blew water
A	oh yeah
B	like a lot of stupid people do they go in through it too fast
A	ah
B	no you don't
B	I don't think
A	I did
B	haven't seen anybody going through that that go through steady you know?
A	I went slow and steady and what happened?
B	you have to go very very slow
A	my car blew up
B	in fact your gears aren't low enough you've got to ride the clutch
A	the trouble is the trouble is
B	and rev
A	the air filter on that car
B	it was on that Cavalier I think wasn't it?
A	oh it was a
B	was it a Cavalier
A	it was a Cavalier
B	what did we do with it? did we repair it? or?
A	yes
B	who did it?
A	who did it?
B	I can't remember having it done
A	yes it was
C	what? it happened on the Vauxhall?
A	it happened
B	yeah some of the air
A	oh
B	in the car
C	yeah I know but I thought it happened
C	when you were in the BMW
B	no I don't think it happened in the BMW
A	no
B	yeah it just it just
A	yeah
B	where the water
A	all the bottom half of the engine had to be replaced
B	water
A	mm
B	and people people think they can go through
A	well that's what you told me but you were wrong
B	mm
B	it doesn't matter how
A	you'll be fine
B	if your air
A	mm
B	is at the water level it doesn't matter how slow you go and how much you rev it you're gonna get water into your
A	yeah
B	and that would
A	that's exact I went
B	that'll blow your engine
A	I went slow
B	I don't think it was that low on that car
A	it was that low
B	but anyway we'll always beg to differ on that point
A	mm
B	and er I don't think there was any witnesses to prove it any different so
A	no
B	however
A	mm
B	I er won't be
A	yeah I followed your instructions
B	mm
B	that's the problem
A	I'd been through that flood loads of times and I'd always got out the other side
C	what? so what did you do differently then?
A	the water I didn't do anything differently it was the water that was deeper that was the problem
B	oh you said you'd been through it many a time like that
A	I'd been through
B	so obviously that time you you you you didn't do it right did you?
B	you see
A	that time I went through slow and steady and I didn't get I did get through but I was
B	see usually truth truth will out
A	yeah
B	truth will out usually
A	no it was just that bit deeper that day
B	I don't know you didn't go with the measuring stick
A	sadly I didn't if I'd had a measuring stick
B	actually it'd only get to
A	if some man had walked in front of me with a measuring stick I wouldn't've done it
B	actually
A	yeah
B	so it would be no deeper that day than any other day
A	it would've run away
B	unfortunately you were just
B	mm
A	it was
B	oh well you'd have to come up with some
A	mm
B	good excuse
A	I should've taken the warning
B	especially when you've blown your engine off
A	I should've taken the warning from the car on the other side of the flood that was pulled up by the side I should've noted that and thought
B	oh there's some reason for this
A	there's some reason for it but I didn't
B	could it be the water?
A	I thought no
C	but surely if you rev you'll suck the water in?
B	no er
A	no
B	it's it's to stop any water going up your exhaust pipe
A	yeah
A	believe you me I was revving like hell
C	oh yeah
A	revving like hell
B	if it's blowing the exhaust out it can't go up your pipe
A	yeah
B	and your air your air intake's another thing and it's
B	er in some cars they they are poorly designed
A	I
B	they have some of them behind their bumpers
A	mm
B	which is absolutely crackers
A	started banging when I was about halfway through I thought I hope it makes it to the other side because my footwear wasn't suitable for paddling I can tell you
B	I think yours on your car's
B	quite high up
A	mm
B	but er they are on these
A	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
B	off roaders
A	I don't know why they put them so low down it's
B	well they're bad designs
A	yeah they're badly designed the air filter should be higher
B	I think it's Renaults er
A	mm
B	quite
C	has
A	keeping it
C	is he?
A	mm
C	does
A	yeah
C	what did he say about it?
A	nothing
C	really?
A	mm
B	why would he have ever thought he could've justified having a brand new
A	I don't know
B	he's not a farmer
A	he was in possession
B	he was only going to lose money at the end of the day
A	he was in possession of a brand new
B	oh
A	yeah
B	well
A	mind he's got loads of them hasn't he? so
B	I think it's a good er
A	mm
B	if he lived long enough
A	he would've made money
A	mm
B	it could be worth
A	well er
B	managed to get the last one
A	I think if they've got
B	and evidence of it being the last one
A	if they have so many people waiting
B	well they probably
B	they probably won't lose money
B	Morris Minor?
B	estate?
A	no no no no
A	the sports car
B	oh the erm
A	hand built
B	mm quite a few hand built ones
A	yeah
B	Morgan?
A	Morgan
B	the Morgans?
A	those Morgans increased in value as soon
B	oh yeah yeah yeah like
A	as soon as you had possession of them
B	they're one offs
A	but then they're thinking that'll happen to Defenders well I don't know
B	yeah well it probably will
A	do you think so?
B	mm
B	well
A	mm
B	and they're worth a lot of money now well the
A	mm
B	they're worth more money now
A	mm
B	so that'll happen
A	mm
B	mm
A	with a
B	that was worth quite a bit and that was an old Mark One
A	yeah
B	if you er
A	mm
B	they do become very valuable
A	mm
B	if you keep
A	mm
A	well
C	has it?
A	mm
B	once it becomes
B	once they stop making them
A	because he's drifted it a lot so it's been
A	mm
B	it gets
A	mm
B	you know they like went to scrap yard and one thing and another
A	mm
B	and then you'd have
C	mm
A	mm
C	that's what
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that type of car it wouldn't've
A	oh no
B	that hybrid I don't think I don't think
C	no
B	do make money
A	do they?
C	she could've got a collectable though
A	mm
B	but they're old ones
B	nearly all old nearly all old cars
B	mm I don't know whether you could say that really when they can
A	yes but
B	well it was nineteen thousand

B	not exactly
C	nineteen thousand for
B	new
C	that?
B	yeah
C	goodness me
B	which you never ever get back
A	mm

C	did she?
A	yeah their house sale's fallen through so they've had to take the deposit off the new house so

B	no
A	well they can't till they've sold their house
C	oh no
A	the people know that they're still very interested and want it
B	but they've had two people
C	why has it fallen through?
A	cos the woman who
C	oh
B	that's what happens
A	yeah the chain collapses
C	I bet
B	the only chance
A	well they haven't got probate through yet
B	no
A	so it's bound to be there a little while so
B	so they're still
A	I mean what what they'll have to decide is
A	right away from the road
B	and they are you know
A	oh yeah
B	seems to be the right area for them
A	so they they'll have to decide whether they want to try
B	oh they're expensive aren't they?
A	I know but that's what that's the decision
C	what what's a bridging loan?
B	well it tides you over until you sell your house
C	oh
A	yeah but they'd have to pay interest on a bridging loan
C	yeah
A	you see unless they decided
C	mm
B	depends how much money they need to put down though doesn't it?
A	so
B	sounds like it
A	those houses are letting are letting very quickly in that area
