A	right so hello say hello
B	I'm just looking at a menu
A	okay
A	looking
B	look at this menu
A	so yes I'm going for the big juice number four
B	spicy curry fish with with
A	I always
B	but I don't want a soup
A	get a little bit sort of curious here about erm the quality of the fish
B	fish
A	I
B	yep
A	we're not exactly near the sea
B	fresh then it's not so bad but we don't know where or when
A	mm
B	this occurred
A	good
B	quality yeah
A	mm
B	pumpkin tagliatelle that sounds nice
A	which one's that?
B	pumpkin tagliatelle with prosciutto and cumin
A	oh
A	the veggie-friendly pasta whichever one it was is delicious
B	which one was that?
A	I'm just looking they've changed their menu since we were
B	salmon I don't think any of these are vegetarian
A	no they're not they've taken off the veggie option
A	something or other
B	I had one with mustard that's gone as well
A	mind you they have added a vegan risotto
A	so
B	I've had that
A	I'll kind of let them off
B	I just don't know what to have I just don't know
A	it's a little bit on the random side you get a
B	where are the main meals?
A	you get a vague heading I think the main meals are broken up into pizza pasta fish that type of stuff
B	ah here we go
A	ah yeah
B	cos I've not had any of these things
A	mm
B	oh will it be spicy chicken? probably yes
A	was there any point in looking at the menu?
B	it's
B	and I've not had it for ages
A	the beetroot salad's gorgeous
B	this bloody menu they've changed everything I don't know whether I'm coming or going
A	cool
B	and a juice number number one
A	big or small?
B	what's that? it's not even that much is it? it's not even half a litre
A	no well it's nearly a pint
A	but it's three quid
B	erm
B	I'm er no I'm ready
B	er
A	er oh is it in there? it's not in there
B	no
B	so and also
A	oh yeah
B	going to have to do
A	erm
B	yeah
unknown_female	uhu
B	yeah er
B	oh
B	uhu erm
B	er I need to have a look
B	look at the sides I can't remember what any of these words mean
B	mm
A	is that you?
A	phew
B	I think she's the only probably the person under twenty-five in the whole of Poland that has no English
A	yeah that's true how unusual
B	so
A	I know
B	maybe we should start
A	sorry
B	ah
A	yeah
B	cos usually someone manages to say something in
A	I know
B	in English maybe she's just like really resistant
A	I always find if I if
B	mm
A	and I was in
B	uhu
A	pictures and glasses and stuff
B	bubble wrap how would you?
A	oh my god
A	it was hilarious
B	uhu
A	with a bit of English it's vastly improved if you've got a younger person anyway she had a little bit of English and I dunno I was sort of miming it and
A	sort of doing the pop pop pop
A	and say erm moving house and packing wrapping careful you know breaking glass and things like that and pop pop pop and then sort of miming sort of squeezing this bubble wrap or treading on it and going ha ha ha
A	it was hilarious
A	well I didn't get arrested thankfully erm and you know
B	that weren't bubble wrap?
A	compressed air nail guns
A	and things like that
B	uhu
A	so I sort of lifted it up and went pop pop pop and
B	ah
A	light bulb moment led me right the other end to the shop I think we both walked miles me sort of running after her with my trolley
B	that's so funny
A	and found this bubble wrap and we were both absolutely delighted we almost did a little jig of joy
A	the bubble wrap was there yeah it was great
B	that's so funny
A	yeah part of the joy of being in another culture I suppose I do feel a bit bad about not having much of the language but
B	but that is a word that nobody would know in another language
A	I know
B	uhu
A	erm
B	yeah
A	Google Translate but it's doing really weird things where the battery'll be full and then I'll blink and then it'll be empty
B	mm
A	and it'll take ages to charge again
B	mm mm
A	so I'm a bit annoyed with it but all of the credit runs out end of March
B	okay
A	so I might just let it run out and not bother we'll see
B	mm mm
A	we shall see
B	ah what other news have I got? I've this week has flown I've really not even
A	oh my god
B	but that's about as far as it gets eat and try to like squeeze in going to the gym but I really have to
A	yeah
B	but you know no time
A	is that cos of mocks and marking?
B	no I've not even had time to look at the marking
A	oh god
B	it was because I was doing
B	er I did two
A	mm
B	two ninety-minute ones on Thursday
A	Thursday
B	erm so it meant all my one-to-ones were moved forward
A	yeah
B	so I had two in the court two hours in the court a tiny gap two one to ones and then two ninety-minute lessons so it worked out at eight point six six
A	ah
B	which is a lot
A	yeah
B	but that was on top of like Wednesday which is my busiest day
A	ah shit
B	so it was just like trying to find the time to to plan these
A	yeah
B	lessons as well erm
A	so technically if you planned for as long as you taught in a two-day period you'd probably hit
B	mm
A	thirty-six plus hours
B	but it's over so
A	yay
B	I've just got all my marking to do and then just not
A	yeah
B	but never mind
A	and prepare Monday's lessons
B	and prepare Monday's lessons
A	yeah
B	just
B	it'll get done
A	mm
B	I know it will and
A	course you are
B	or two
[ANNOTATION]	They finished marking yesterday.	Contradiction
B	er so yeah but I enjoyed those lessons it's
A	yeah nice crowd
B	really nice
A	they're a nice crowd
B	that FM one
A	are they the ones in the small room that's got
B	no
A	no which ones are they?
B	erm it has in it
A	oh yes yeah yeah
A	who's a pain in the arse
B	I er I
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B despised those lessons.	Contradiction
B	really went off on one with him
A	good for you
B	I was like you're just making yourselves look stupid blah blah blah blah blah
A	yeah
B	stop trying to show off in front of everyone you look like a dick
A	did you?
A	yeah they do
A	I'm sure they do know what dick means but even so
[ANNOTATION]	He got scolded by speaker B.	Entailment
B	no and there was so many
A	yeah good on you
A	good for you
B	er cos he was just being a knob like
A	yeah
B	he yeah he's so annoying
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has been a teacher for two years.	Neutral
A	I wouldn't mind as much if he was just like really clever doing his work then pissing about but he's doing his work and pissing about but getting it all wrong
B	mm
A	so
B	yeah I know
A	you know
B	mm
B	and there's some
[ANNOTATION]	At least he does his work right.	Contradiction
A	yeah
A	I really like him a lot
B	his eyes I was like you're so handsome you're so beautiful
A	ah
B	he's just like got the biggest he's like you know like horse's eyes or cow's eyes like really big
A	yeah
B	he's just got huge eyes
A	he's so funny on one of his first lessons he was trying to sneakily eat rice cakes in class
A	but er under the table and then passing them round and I was like you know if you're hungry just eat
A	just don't get any crumbs everywhere or clean up after yourselves
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but eat
B	yeah
A	those poor kids have been slaving away since dawn
B	I know in my
A	yeah
B	energy to concentrate
A	exactly
A	and drink lots of water
B	yeah
A	I think they're all camels I think everybody in Poland is bred to be a camel
B	yep
A	don't drink enough
B	I was doing health and fitness yesterday and discussion club and one of the questions was I drink several
A	mm
B	er glasses of water a day
A	mm
A	yeah
B	two two big bottles
A	yeah I reckon erm
B	plus tea plus coffee plus
A	a minimum of five pints of water a day
B	mm
A	cos I just keep filling up my pint glass and I was talking to
B	they think it's crazy I think it's because they don't drink tap water
A	yeah
B	so if you're drinking so much water and you're buying bottles or
A	ah
B	these big gallony things
A	yeah
B	then
A	yeah
B	and is okay to drink
A	weird
B	I've been drinking tap water here and I've not died yet so I really
A	yeah yeah
A	yeah I was drinking tap water in Krakow which is probably a lot worse with all the industrial stuff
B	mm
A	and it was fine that was for five weeks
B	yeah
A	and then here I've there was a little Brita filter still in the house so I use that
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	erm which is fine and then oh this I'm really excited by this on Monday I'm getting a UPS delivery of a little water filter that's like a mobile one
B	oh nice
A	it weighs a kilo and it's about a foot twelve inches high erm but you can filter even river water
B	nice
A	and it's got a carbon filter that lasts on average eleven years before it needs to be replaced
B	that's incredible
A	now it's a hundred and fifty quid
B	uhu okay
A	but I figure eleven years worth of not buying plastic bottled water while travelling
B	uhu
A	out and about and don't know what water quality's like
B	yeah
A	happy days
B	yeah
A	so yeah and erm as part of the promotion you get a free in inverted commas er plastic gym bottle now I don't like plastic bottles
B	mm
A	I have the metal Sigg bottles as you know but it promises faithfully that there's no leakage of any
B	mm
A	nasty chemicals
B	mm
A	and that's also got a filter in it
B	oh that's good
A	bloody brilliant so I'm just amazed
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	that the technology is there these days
B	yeah
A	to have this mobile affordable
B	mm
A	relatively lightweight thing you can stick in a rucksack
B	yeah
A	and take anywhere
B	lots of well a few of my friends have these filter gym bottles
A	I hate those
B	I don't know if they work or
A	yeah
B	how good the
A	with the little knobby thing
B	it's like a bobbly thing yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	but er no I don't know
A	when I stayed with
B	mm
A	I couldn't get around I mean the temperature was about forty degrees while I was there so that could've been part of it so
B	mm
A	wherever your bottle was even in the shade it was just
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	warm and plasticky and not good
B	uhu
A	so yeah
A	warm water in a metal bottle still tastes not as bad
B	uhu
A	in a plastic bottle but anyway we'll see so I'm excited by that because when I've been sort of er you know I don't know if necessarily I'll be living in the van I probably won't but
B	mm
A	erm and getting clean drinking water
B	mm
A	and quite often like if you had a meal somewhere they didn't mind filling up a big
B	yeah
A	thing for you but my van holds I think it's about twenty litres
B	mm
A	which is fantastic
B	mm
A	erm so now I can fill that up and just filter off from that what I need
B	what you need
A	in the van so
B	mm
A	water is not a problem and theoretically I'm gonna be somewhere warm enough I've got a little erm plastic bag with a small solar panel on it
B	mm
A	so it heats the water so you fill the bag with water leave it outside the van in the sun and you can shower off of that
B	oh that's
A	so theoretically both issues solved
B	yeah solved
A	yeah and I've invested in a actually my brother and my niece bought me it for Christmas or gave me money for it erm a little solar panel that erm then charges a little power bank
B	mm
A	and then I can plug USB devices
B	nice
A	into that so
A	yeah it's cool
B	happy days
B	and she's taking so many photos on her big expensive camera which I presume she's gonna put on Facebook and show all her friends and family you know how what a nice mother she is
A	is this the Polish yummy mummy equivalent?
B	yeah
B	I just no
A	oh well
B	just makes me a bit sad
A	I have an old school friend on Facebook who's so like that and
B	mm
A	cos there's something you know she
B	mm mm
B	oh
A	and she's got
B	uhu
A	so I'm always commenting on her kitten photos
B	oh nice
A	and when she puts up cutesy pictures of the children I usually comment yeah yeah
A	very nice but where's the cat?
B	where's the cat? I was in the gym
A	yeah
B	changing room the other day and this girl was taking pictures of herself like posing in the mirror
A	oh my god
B	er and it was like I just ignored her and then she said to me in Polish oh do you mind taking my picture? and I was like
A	oh no
B	she's like no no no again
A	oh my god
B	and then she just kept bowing
B	I was like this is just the weirdest situation
A	that's hilarious
B	so funny
A	in that big park near to you
B	mm
A	I saw a young man and a young woman and she was pulling all sorts of poses by trees in winter
B	yeah
A	and he was being like a semi-professional photographer
B	the amount of
A	it's interesting
B	like lots of my Polish friends on Facebook have professional-looking profile pictures like
A	yeah
B	they've been to someone who's had it done and one of them one of the girls from the gym has pictures of her and her daughter with like a green screen in the background
A	mm
B	I don't know like a New York skyline or something
A	yeah
B	and er her and her daughter are wearing matching outfits
B	it's just the worst thing
B	just wanna
A	aren't other cultures fun?
B	like so
A	yeah
B	I can't imagine
A	no
B	I know people who have these sort of professional studio photos done
A	mm
B	er and it's like you know these awful ones with white backgrounds and they're all like lying on the ground with their head like this
A	oh yeah yeah yeah
B	and you just think oh for god's sake stop
A	yeah
A	I had a job for a week selling those
B	did you?
A	yeah I worked up
B	what? is that fact?
A	well apparently so erm I presume there are so many franchises that's probably the issue
B	mm uhu
A	and er over the course of a week it was torture erm cold-calling basically having people telling you to fuck off or you know
B	mm
A	all the sorts of things that I no longer say to people when they cold-call me
A	so
B	yeah
A	yeah I hated that job and I promised myself I would never ever ever again work in sales
B	mm
A	and I haven't
B	it's not the same
A	always with the attitude of I ignore targets I don't engage with targets
B	yeah and those people would buy the stuff anyway
A	yeah
B	they don't need to er be
A	yeah
B	yeah we've got a
A	but yeah I respect people's free will and I'm not
B	uhu
A	not happy to try and persuade somebody to buy something
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think these professional photos part of that might even be a like central European thing or a
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	do you think?
A	mainland Europe thing yeah cos I know friends in Germany do it as well and erm it was one of my one-to-ones actually young Polish guy was doing his er getting his provisional driving licence and he had to have an ear showing
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
A	isn't that random?
B	what? to show you've got ears?
A	to show you have ears yeah you had to have this shot that's like
B	from the side
A	yeah almost from the side
B	mm
A	you still need to see both
B	yeah
A	your eyes and everything but you have to show an ear and I think that's really common and
B	mm
B	yeah I've got a photo on my CV
A	yeah and I was talking to
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said that he got a photo on his CV and his not sure why	Neutral
A	they are everywhere and she said you just wander in it's normally upstairs in somebody's apartment in their living room or something and they've got this professional setup set up and they've got all of the equipment so they take the photo once you agree yes that's the shot that I want they push a button and it gets processed through a machine then pops out four identical photos
B	uhu okay
A	so it's like they've had to pay for the equipment but
B	yeah
B	so
A	it's funny
A	I had to put one on my CV for when I applied for here so I just scanned my passport photo so you can still see either
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that he is going to put it in his CV when he wants to apply for something	Entailment
B	mm
A	the stamp or the hologram or whatever it is
B	the
A	that's on it but
B	mm
A	oh well it's a likeness
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	yes it's definitely your face oh pizza for the table these kids are eating pizza
A	that was nice pizza the other night I enjoyed that
A	mm
B	yeah it was nice
A	yeah
B	hungry all the time
A	so tomorrow I'm not so sure how you guys are gonna be fixed for that cos
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think they not gonna fix it	Neutral
A	you've got Monday to prepare for
B	I I don't care about Monday
A	yeah?
A	yeah yeah I'm up for it no worries
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah sure
A	or if she probably didn't ought to be driving then yeah I can pick all of you up and drop all of you off it's not a bother
B	yeah sure
A	so
B	you know in here it says there is wi-fi and then there just isn't
A	I'm on it
B	what is it?
A	I don't know
B	I don't know what the password is though
A	no that's what I'm saying cos I'm connected to the wi-fi
B	oh
A	no I've got it I'm connected to it
B	I know
A	why do people breed? don't do it
B	no
A	yeah
B	I think I've tried to guess before and I just haven't been able to work it out
A	I think when I got it here that they had to write it down
B	uhu
A	cos it was that complex
B	okay
A	yeah
B	I was gonna say er this party's like starts at six or something so I think it's quite soon
A	yeah oh
B	erm
A	I need to keep an eye on the time I'm seeing
B	okay
A	yeah so need to get the bus back
B	erm

B	oh shit
A	flown back to South Africa

B	mm
A	he sounds pretty down about not having found work
B	mm
A	yeah
B	poor
A	crossed my mind
B	yeah yeah
A	cos he hasn't exactly got a lot of stuff has he?
B	did he?
A	yeah and I know he has bought some clothes here since but it crossed my mind if he might
B	I don't I think he'd be the the sort of person who would
A	oh
B	she's erm
A	mm
B	sort of talking about it but he erm she fell down the stairs somewhere
A	wow
B	yeah so his sister flew from Los Angeles

A	and we're back

A	I was just thinking where in town does really good coffee that's not a rip-off price?
B	on a Saturday
A	on a Saturday yeah
B	at three o'clock
A	erm I think the hotel is a bit overpriced
B	yeah and yeah
A	and it's not that good what about that erm traditional place that doesn't have a toilet?
B	yes
A	yes
B	yeah
A	let's try there oh no if it's traditional it'll be closed on Saturday afternoon
A	erm
B	I'd like to be somewhere that's not the hotel but where you can sort of look outside
A	yeah I like that too
B	and I think that's only the hotel or the
A	or the
B	is it?
A	yeah it
B	or
A	you can't really look out there can you?
A	oh how about the
B	yeah okay I've never been in the
A	the
B	if we can get a table I'd like to
A	excellent coffee
B	okay
A	I think it's seven złoty and the coffee's brilliant
B	okay
A	yeah
B	hope we can get a table
A	yeah
B	okay
A	I think this was last weekend's Valentine's CD
B	do you think?
A	and they've just left it in the CD player
B	mm
A	so when they opened up this Friday Saturday Sunday in the upstairs of the building that's the CD that was left from last weekend I think that's what's happened
B	mm and this yeah yes there's still lots of Valentine's stuff everywhere
A	mm half price
B	half price
A	yeah
A	lots of heart-shaped
B	I know
A	oh at
B	yeah it's dead expensive it's like ten złoty at the bar
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I never mind paying for food or drink if it's of really good quality
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	not really but it not really
B	but
A	I find with chocolate of that quality I can't handle more than a couple of squares at a time
B	mm
A	cos I get such a cocoa high
B	mm
A	and I I find er it's also like erm cups of tea I can't have even a square of proper chocolate after six o'clock at night
B	mm
A	or I'm up all night
A	jeez I think that's happy birthday isn't it?
B	mm
A	yeah be interesting if I do get this
B	no
A	ah I did say I was very well I was diplomatically honest in my introductory letter and said I have no experience of children I didn't say I positively dislike them
B	mm
A	erm
B	not even of teaching children just of children
A	no I have no experience of children in general full stop
B	uhu uhu
A	I mean I have a niece
A	I sort of ignored her until she was old enough to hold a proper conversation erm never held her when she was a baby
B	oh no I've never
A	in my arms it's like shit what do I do now? you know
B	bit like Hugh Grant in About a Boy
A	exactly like Hugh Grant in About a Boy
A	it's not a cat what do I do with it? yeah
B	that's funny
A	so I dunno but then I was
B	mm
A	and I mean you know you do get the occasional young person that I can relate to there's erm
A	we were able to have er you know quite grown-up conversations about travelling and
B	mm
A	really engaged with her but I didn't really notice that she was there erm at the time although at mealtimes I do remember conversing with her and it wasn't as painful as I expected it to be
B	mm
B	mm
A	er cos I think she's always been quite able to
B	mm
A	you know hold a lucid conversation even at a young age so
B	mm mm mm yeah I think it erm if you're an only child
A	mm
B	I think it helps if you are always
A	yeah
B	around adults it helps
A	yeah
B	whereas kids who grow up with brothers and sisters stay younger
A	ah
B	because they are left to their own devices they don't have any they don't have any as much adult contact because they have each other
A	interesting
B	whereas if you're an only child
A	yeah
B	mm yeah if there's a huge age gap then you would spend more time with adults I think
A	makes sense
B	so that's my theory
A	yeah
B	on
A	yes I mean I'm sure they're very nice
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I I think
A	yeah
B	and there's not a lot going on and it depends on upbringing and where they're from some
A	wow
B	and he got an A at FCE
A	oh my god As are like rocking horse shit aren't they?
B	mm at twelve years old
A	goodness me
B	er and you know
A	wow
B	some of these kids are just frightening frightening
A	yeah
B	erm but they come from money and like not just a bit rich
A	yeah
B	like the super rich
A	yeah
B	the world's super richest children erm I was looking at the fees for this school they've put the fees up erm
A	they should put your wages up then
B	well I've got a two hundred pound bonus so I'm not complaining
B	erm but two weeks at this school to send one child for two weeks it's two and a half thousand pounds
A	woah
B	to send
A	how much of that do you see?
B	erm
A	one child
B	yeah
B	I get one child to pay
A	yeah
B	uhu
B	erm for a month and a lot of them come for a month five thousand pounds
A	wow no discount for doing extra?
B	no discount for doing it longer no
A	crikey
B	some of them send a whole family you can have three or four kids from the same family
A	yeah
B	but imagine having and it's I mean it's not throwing away money
A	I mean if I had children and I had money
B	you would
B	yeah there's this girl
A	yeah
A	mm
B	er she spends five weeks in
A	mm
B	and five weeks in Bulgaria at tennis camp and that's her summer holiday she doesn't see her parents
A	wow
B	her father I think is
A	yeah
B	erm and she's quite close to her sister who's in her thirties
A	yeah
B	so her sister comes and visits her sister lives in
A	yeah
B	and I think they probably a lot of them live at boarding school as well
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	have nannies
A	yeah
B	send them to boarding school send them to a different country on summer holidays
A	yeah yeah
B	but
A	no I think my issue with children particularly young children it's a bit like I can sort of relate it to dogs as well you know with dogs it's there's a level of unconsciousness that does my head in you know when they're just barking
B	mm
A	and they're off their heads they're not really focusing on what's going on
B	yeah
A	in well at least reality as I perceive it and I see a lot of children doing that as well
B	uhu
A	if it's like they're being like a cat when it's chasing a leaf so it's like so focused
B	focused on something
A	in that now moment it's having a lot of fun that I can engage with
B	mm
A	but quite often there's just like a lot of bullshit chatter and squealing that
B	mm
A	reminds me of a dog that's just barking its head off
B	mm
A	so if they're being like a cat fine if they're being like a dog no
B	yeah
A	irritating as hell get them out of my face
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	I think a lot of er I don't know I think a lot of people really kind of er baby children too much
A	mm
B	like I've worked with people who you know they have this sort of primary school teacher voice and it's all very soft and sweet and er you know as soon as they can talk they can
A	yeah
B	I think the
A	yeah
B	then the sort of the better
A	that I don't mind so much you know if I if there's a
B	mm
A	then that
B	mm
A	you know that I can handle
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	just train them up for life that's my advice
A	yeah
B	in my experience with er children and teenagers
A	yeah
B	just take the piss as much as you can
A	well that's engagement so
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
