B	and you won't see it but we saw a frozen waterfall well you'll see the waterfall but it's probably not frozen this time of year
A	frozen?
B	yeah it was amazing it was actually a waterfall and it was frozen
A	so it's just like a sheet of ice just dropping off like a mountain?
B	yeah basically
C	oh
B	you could walk up to it and walk under it and things
A	that's really cool
B	yeah
B	but yeah
C	oh
B	oh Blue Lagoon is brilliant you'll definitely go to there I'm sure you will it's really good
B	you know like it's really warm all the time it's like as warm as a jacuzzi

A	it's just
B	oh my god has he got another
A	it's a
A	okay but you're going like have you got something on your nose?
A	but I'm like this
B	you've been rubbing it or something no I mean not now you look like you were rubbing it in other times
A	oh
B	so
A	you could just say you've got something there not you've got something there
B	yeah
A	so that's like saying scratch it or
B	yeah okay
A	get rid of it it's ice cream
A	you were gonna say something
B	did you oh you said
A	no
B	no
A	oh wait yeah
B	you did
A	I said
B	to the Blue Lagoon?
B	yeah but I think it's I mean I don't know but
C	oh
A	don't know if she'd go twice
A	I think she'd like to but I don't know if it's a must do cos I think
A	erm yeah I'm pretty sure they've been going there every year for
B	the whole family?
A	yeah not for like ever but I think
B	with the whole family? they er take quite a lot of trips together don't they?
A	mm
B	it's kind of nice
A	mm
B	I'd love to go away with erm
A	like amazing
B	who's
A	but
B	oh okay
A	er he used to work a lot and he had an amazing job being an accountant when he when he was a bit younger
B	yeah yeah
A	now he can't really work as much so but three days a year he gets he gets to
B	what? for three days?
A	three days a year
B	is that all he works?
A	yeah
B	oh my god
A	he he is earning sixty
B	yeah but still what? how much money does he get?
A	a lot of sixty-year-olds don't really work any more
B	well most most do now I mean you
A	I I
B	I mean if you anything earlier than that is early retirement
A	mm
B	special retirement what does what what does he? how much does he earn for three days in that year?
A	I dunno he hasn't told me
B	my god that is just so sewn up isn't it?
A	it's not like but they're not super rich though
B	well if you can afford to
A	erm that was a long time ago when he had like that twenty-four seven
B	okay but if you can afford not to work the rest of the year and take holidays
A	mm
B	mm I should've I should've married a rich man
A	mm
A	yeah but I don't think it matters really about how much money they really have
B	well it does help I think
A	it does it does it does help but I don't think you should do it solely on how much money they have
B	no but I did it so the opposite so erm
A	good keep doing that
B	well I don't know if it's done me any favours but that's probably terribly cynical advice
A	well it's made you it's made you a good person
A	cos you'd be a bad person if you'd've married for the money
B	it's not made me bitter has it?
A	no
B	joke erm
B	cos money
B	I suppose for you if if you were gonna marry a woman yeah I'd hate you to marry a women who's just after your money if you were making loads of money that would make me feel sad
A	yeah they're called gold-diggers
B	yeah
A	yeah well I'm not that age yet I'm not that age yet
B	no I know no but
A	I don't really wanna talk about it yet
B	don't you?
A	no because I know all that stuff already and I don't like it's like twenty years thirty years in the future so
B	yeah
A	I'm gonna be talking about that stuff all again then
B	you don't like see these as pearls of wisdom that are just?
A	no
B	I see
A	yep
B	but yeah I mean that's er that's really quite wealthy
A	mm
B	well obviously he can't cos he works more
B	people say that how could people say that if you're
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	first off they have they no no no you hold on
A	yeah I've gotta say something
B	okay
A	he was quite rich back in the day when he had when he had like he had that job twenty-four seven well but obviously he gets a bit
B	mm
A	so it's quite a bit more he gets paid for his job now cos it's only three days
B	mm
A	but when he was working a lot he was getting a lot of money and that's when he bought the house for good he doesn't have to pay any money now erm so
B	but that is wealth isn't it? because then you've got your house which er is worth a lot and that is being wealthy and I'm not putting them down but that is being wealthy it's just I've known a lot of people who are quite wealthy I don't know for some reason keep saying that they're not but I mean it's okay
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
A	yeah it's just when I think about being rich or I think about like sitting back on like a thing where you have like twenty twenty personal assistants mowing your garden
B	what? you mean a super yacht? well that that's like super rich isn't it? that's super super wealth
A	David Cameron probably has a really nice house and a lot more money than
B	yeah I mean his wife's got a load of money actually apparently David Cameron his wife his wife is loaded
A	pardon?
B	cos his her parents are very wealthy
B	like it's nice to be able to you know
B	to give your give your kids everything isn't it?
B	so maybe you should think about going into accounting
A	mum I'm I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do a job that I hate because I might be the richest man in the world but I'd be depressed
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure about gonna do a job or not	Entailment
B	why? would you hate accounting?
A	I I think I would really would hate accounting
B	I think I I wouldn't mind it actually maybe I should become an accountant do you think it's too late?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	no I don't think you're rich and it'd cost a lot of money to become a good accountant
B	I think yeah you have to take lots of exams and I think
A	exactly
B	to erm to get very good clients which give you a lot of money
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about clients	Entailment
A	you have to have a lot of money
B	I think no yeah partly you have to have a but you you have to have good contacts and I've got no good contacts did you know your grandfather my sorry your great-grandfather
A	no
B	my grandfather
A	I didn't
B	was now you're just being facetious erm
A	I don't know my grandfather
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure about grandfather does he know or not	Neutral
B	was was an accountant?
A	mm?
B	was an accountant
B	he was the first Catholic accountant because do you know at that time
A	not in the world?
B	erm so anyway he became an accountant and er he was a really really well respected man really good man he used to help he used to use his money and his cos he he got quite erm well known he used to
A	mm
A	yeah it's just if I did that I'd probably be depressed
B	so what job would you do
A	oh scientist
B	are you?
A	I'd love to do an astronomy course
B	astronomer?
A	yeah
B	but you know astronomy is math? you
A	I do I do know that
A	yeah but you don't have to be an accountant to I'm not gonna take an accountant course if I wanna be an astronomer cos it's not it's it's not like you're doing
B	yeah you know you're gonna have to get better better grades better grades though if you're gonna do?

B	there's nothing bad about that it's a fascinating subject
A	I know I know but it's just I feel like it's erm it's unfair that he's gifted with liking it so much
B	gifted? maybe he just knuckles down and he doesn't just like fill his brain
A	mum I doubt he was like I hate history so I'm gonna force myself to love it I doubt he would
B	no but he probably just got got into something that other people were just it's it's very easy to do games it's not easy to get into history
A	fair enough well he's gifted with the talent to be good at being good at easy hard getting into history
A	I dunno I er I only really found out the results of my friends and I got higher than all of them
B	you got higher than all of them? in maths?
A	in my all of my friends
B	what about your other subjects?
A	I don't know we're well I've only discussed maths cos that was like we only really discussed our results in school
