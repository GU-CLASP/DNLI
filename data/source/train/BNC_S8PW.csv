B	yes that's good
A	yeah
B	thank you
C	if you had to do that yourself would that be a problem?
B	well
B	I did do the chairs all by myself
C	yes
B	but I wouldn't be very confident drilling into a wall
C	well
B	or the door
A	the door'll be fine
B	yes because if you put furniture together then
C	yes
A	mm
B	you can't go that wrong
C	no
B	but yes if you went into a wall wrong
C	yes
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	wouldn't be very happy about that

A	yeah
B	you turn the corner
A	oh that's what I thought
B	and the first one on your right
A	yeah just round the corner
B	yes
A	yeah
B	and then I met the other people who were directly opposite to the right in the big detached one
C	right
B	once
C	okay oh right
B	and then they've put up two buy to let or to let signs as someone's done buy to let
C	right
B	there's no one there
A	ah so
B	that whole
A	somebody's
B	and the lady next door seems to have gone away cos her car's never there now
C	oh right

A	so a couple of people have bought them to let them?
B	yes
A	to rent?
B	it looks like it
A	yeah
B	and the rest aren't finished
C	no
B	the one the terraced at er detached at the end isn't finished
A	no
B	they're still all going inside the builders
A	no
B	they'd dug up several places in the road in front of me
A	what for a pipe? or
B	for the Virgin Media pack
C	ah really?
B	and now they have to re-tarmac the whole thing again
C	oh dear
B	the truck's not coming with the tarmac don't know maybe next week so they've messed it up but it's fine they've filled in the holes now
C	ah get out
B	get out again but it's not tarmacked now
B	that's all they've put the fence up now
A	ah
B	so they can't any more
A	yeah
B	and churned it all up so that's all closed off so they can only walk around now
A	right
B	so I see the workmen a lot they're the only people I see on the road cos it's sort of their shortcut to the car park
C	mm right okay oh right yes
A	yeah
B	but they can only walk now they can't drive
C	to get to know those
B	yes I know them I know what they're doing
C	yes
B	and they're very friendly they tell me what they're doing
C	oh good and it's good you've joined the choir because at least that's something you don't know the people in your road cos
B	no
C	at least you know
B	yes it's good
C	have you been to that Co-op at all?
B	once it's okay there's not loads there I mean it's good for sort of
B	you know I can get if I run out of milk
C	yes getting some milk
B	can get milk and bread there
C	oh no no
B	I'll just drive to
C	oh yeah okay that's
B	and then fill up the car while I'm there
C	yes so that'll take you what quarter of an hour?
B	quarter of an hour but it's worth it cos the prices
C	not bad is it?
B	are much better
C	yes
B	and there's more choice
C	yeah they have
C	yeah yes
B	didn't have an ice scraper this week
C	oh yeah
B	there was a thick frost on the car
C	well we haven't had that here
B	thick like a
C	yes
B	couple of centimetres almost
C	yes
B	seemed like that had to get a credit card and scrape it off
C	mm
B	was not very good for it
B	yes I didn't have that either
B	no the other thing's to turn on the car isn't it? a minute before you leave
C	yes
B	and put the heater on
C	yes
B	yes
A	erm did you want one sugar
B	erm no thank you
A	no sugar?
B	no sugar thank you
C	thank you
B	I know
C	it's two two and a half weeks I think
B	yes it's good
C	full marks
B	yes I mean that's good in a way though isn't it?
C	I I think it's better yeah and then and then by the time you have time to breathe you actually you're quite well established
B	yes
C	cos otherwise you're
B	mm
C	so get going
B	yes
C	mm
B	thank you dad
A	oh
C	oh
B	so
A	what? ice from where?
B	it was really icy one morning
C	it's different weather where
B	really really cold
A	but it
B	it really went down
A	have you got an ice scraper now?
B	I went today to the supermarket and got one
A	in Tesco's or?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yes
A	I mean for things like that you know they're good
B	yeah they're good yes
A	pardon?
B	I had a choice of three sorts of ice scraper
C	oh right
B	yes
C	and the train service is actually good so all that's gone
B	well yeah it's only one an hour so it's not that good for work
C	oh no oh
B	because they
A	wrong time
B	they're yes they're they leave on the half hour
C	mm
B	I mean actually start the lesson the hour
C	yes
B	so it's not enough time
C	no
B	so it means I'd have to go an hour and a half early
C	well that's a pity isn't it?
B	yeah so that's not so good so on my late day which is Tuesday
C	okay
B	cos it goes oh the good thing is it goes at nine thirty-one so then you're on off-peak
C	oh right okay so that's good
B	peak so they've worked that out quite carefully
A	yeah
B	so that's quite thoughtful
C	yes
B	but all the other days
C	yes
B	cos I'd have to get the seven thirty train
C	yes
B	to be sure of getting there for ten to nine
A	and then do a bit of
C	unless you have work to
B	and I'd be paying the peak train fare
B	yes
C	mm
B	and two pounds thirty it's the same for a single and a return but I mean two pounds thirty is fine
C	yes
B	yeah off-peak
C	yeah that's very good
B	because you see the peak hours I think I need to double check but I think peak hours are only in the morning there is no
A	right
B	peak in the afternoon
B	yeah so it's after nine thirty is off-peak
C	so you've got a single track line there
C	so
B	that's maybe why then they can only do one an hour
C	so where so where does the train come in from there there?
B	erm
C	ah right okay
A	yeah that
B	but
A	they're they're the
B	yes

A	if you pass the
B	through that
A	through that as well as through part of the frame
B	oh yes
A	you could then tie it to something so you don't need to remove the
B	oh that's a good idea so I'll try that this week
A	you don't don't need to remove
B	yes that might work better
A	the seat

C	oh is it?
B	it's called affogato
C	oh right I never had that before
B	have a coffee and an ice cream but then you think that's quite extravagant that's a good way round it
C	that's what I said to grandpa I said there's no need to buy coffee now
B	yes
A	did he have the same?
C	yes I don't know if he knew what it well I don't know if he knew what it was or not
A	well at least he likes ice cream

C	oh yes
B	so you get the cold ice cream and then coffee's usually hot
C	yes
B	mm
A	mm
C	yes
C	I'm trying to think what it's called but anyway it was a bit of a place to go the plaice was just instead of giving you a little bit of plaice you know it's thin and we have like three
B	yeah
C	good sliced pieces
B	cor
C	beautifully cooked and then potatoes which were done in a creamy sauce garlic sauce
B	oh right
C	it was lovely
B	mm

A	was it was it the
A	that's on the left isn't it when you're driving down?
C	yes and it's no
A	from here
C	it's not expensive it's no more than anywhere else to be honest
B	oh right
C	if you order fish it always costs more
B	mm
C	anyway
B	yes that's good it's reopened
A	yeah oh yes mine was
C	yes
B	so what happened with people before?
C	they fell out with the villagers I don't know what happened but people didn't like them
B	mm
C	and people didn't go there at all
B	yeah
C	and so in the end you know really there was no trade there at all it closed down
A	but they weren't friendly
B	no
A	no they weren't
C	and the food wasn't special I
A	well they chopped the menu by about three quarters I think straight away
C	did they? oh yes
A	they only had like three or four things and they were very sort of snack things
C	ah yes
A	very you know sort of er
B	mm
C	yes because
B	yes
C	and I think if the pub could get going and have people coming from outside
B	yeah yeah mm
C	it would make a lot of difference to the village
B	yes it's true
C	just like
B	yes
C	so I said if dad and I went there just once a month and we all did that then that could make a make a difference
B	yes it's true
C	they seemed very pleasant
B	yes
C	yeah
B	friendly
C	yes
B	mm
C	it was a big venture for them because I think they come from the south east
A	yeah
C	so to move down here with no experience of running a business
A	was it
B	yes
C	quite a big thing
B	yes it is
C	but they must have employed a good chef to have such good quality meals there
B	yes they yes that's right
C	mm
B	so that's good
C	cos you get tired of it at some pubs don't you? when it's the same thing all the time on the menu
B	yes well it's good they had a couple of specials
C	cos you'd
B	they had three actually didn't they?
A	yeah
C	yes
B	plus the starters that's quite good

A	and I'll put it up as high as I
B	yes
A	and those single hooks I'll put a cross point
B	yes
A	at the top of
B	yes
A	you know
B	on top of the yeah
A	at that height cos then
B	yes that's good
B	yes thank you
A	and then you know because that'll be the same colour or very near
B	yes that's right
[ANNOTATION]	person B find colour	Entailment

A	oh every week for the recycling? so that's so that's like
[ANNOTATION]	they don't know time for recycling	Neutral
B	yes but I haven't quite worked out the day but it's something midweek so I just put out
B	oh goodness that's a lot
C	well there's a few more there than I thought
B	oh dear
C	cos you said to keep the books for when you didn't have time to look last time or something
B	yeah
C	and so I did but then the pile got ridiculous I thought I'm not gonna like half these books
C	no I read
B	it's good
C	I think I don't sleep that well so if I'm awake for two hours in the night
[ANNOTATION]	person C don't sleep well	Neutral
B	mm

A	yes
C	have you read any of his
B	yeah but I can't think what but I've read some of his others
C	Chesil Beach is that in Ian Mcewan
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure where is Chesil Beach	Neutral
B	oh I haven't read that one
C	now you see that won prize the Booker Prize but
B	yes I've heard of this
C	but actually I didn't
B	you didn't like it?
C	no that's the funny thing isn't it with some of them?
[ANNOTATION]	it is a funny thing	Entailment
A	what's the book?
C	but you might like it but I couldn't
B	The Narrow Road To The Deep North
C	I read it all but I couldn't really get into it
B	mm
C	yes so that's the best seller seller now and it has been for a while
B	oh right yes that
A	do you want a bit more coffee
B	oh yes please thank you
C	well yeah that'd be it cos you can't really decide now can you?
B	no thank you
C	I know I do
B	good thank you
C	er The Ice Twins that was quite good
B	ah yes
B	they look good
C	yes and
B	yes
C	erm
B	thank you yes I
C	yes and she did erm the one on the Greek island erm
B	yes
C	and that but people say the first one and I agree it was far the best
B	ah right
C	yes but the others are nice but not as good
B	yes
C	yes
B	that was one about the leprosy wasn't it? the lepers' island
C	yeah that's it that's
B	that was good
B	I think that was called The Thread
C	I don't think I think
B	or was that not the one?
C	that's another one
B	oh right
C	yes I must say it is in the middle of the night my reading generally
B	cor
C	but I think that in my age group a lot of people have problems with sleep
B	yes
C	well I think I do but erm just
C	it's so they say that but I I think I do after all the exercise
B	yes well anyway everyone's different
C	yes exactly
B	yes
C	so if I wake up at the moment I go to sleep and I might wake up about four
B	mm
C	read for a couple of hours then if I'm lucky I get back to sleep at six with but if I have to go to work of course that'd be very annoying
B	dear
C	yes
C	the news
B	ah I don't have a television at the moment
C	no
B	but I've been watching Netflix er one thing every night
C	ah that's good
B	thirty minutes
C	what have you been watching then?
C	uhu
B	about a middle class woman who has done something bad when she was in her twenties
C	oh right
B	and the law catches up with her and that's how it starts she's got to go to prison but you know she's
C	ah
B	really middle class
C	that must be difficult
B	you know actually in a way it's worse isn't it?
C	mm
B	because if she was from a family where lots of people have been in and out of prison then it wouldn't be as bad have you heard of that? Orange Is The New Black?
C	mm
B	about this middle class American
A	oh right yes yes
B	young in her thirties but she ends up in prison
A	yeah yeah
B	it's quite funny
A	yeah
B	cos she's really unsuitable
A	no
B	and of course they give her a really hard time
A	oh
C	yes
B	er but she's getting on okay now but then of course the looks at the effect on her relationship outside where she's changed
C	yeah
B	because of her prison experience but of course they haven't
C	yes
B	have you watched that?
A	I haven't actually that
B	it's quite very funny yeah it's quite witty and it yeah it's quite I suppose quite observant because in a way it'd be more difficult if you were nothing like
A	yeah
B	any of the other people
A	yeah
B	she just has to get on with it
C	so that's your way you're relaxing
B	yes that's good in the evenings
B	yes that's true yes I thought that
C	so when you get time you want to go and see what sort of curtain rails
B	no dad and I did look didn't we? we we went to erm
A	yeah
C	yes
B	yeah we went to Wickes and had a look
C	do you like this sort or not?
B	yes it and we saw some like this and to be honest they were cheaper weren't they than the the fake metal ones?
A	yeah that fake metal one
B	I don't really understand
A	I didn't think was very good
B	no
C	cos until we came here we always
B	not that strong
C	we didn't have these much
A	no
C	from previous houses we just had what were what were they straight metal?
A	erm actually they're
A	they're plastic rails
B	but these run well don't they?
A	er yes
B	cos they're big hooks
A	oh yes yes they don't
B	they don't
A	drag
B	yes
C	so we've got some brown ones
B	yes
C	yes
B	yes
C	except I don't expect you'll be making yourself you're buying ready made
B	probably
C	yes
B	I yes in Oman I got them made up I bought the fabric but it's cheap there to get things made up
A	yeah probably
B	yes very cheap tailoring
C	mm
B	see
C	yes I was phoning
B	yes
A	I I I I just just
C	I can't understand it
B	so much up there
A	well they might be there but there's
B	yes
A	er you can't start moving all the boxes
B	no
A	erm cos you've got nowhere to move them to
B	no
A	mm
B	maybe I should take a couple back of mine
A	right
B	when I go today
A	I saw one you might like it's called er it's a small one it says
C	we wondered whether to
A	it's not not the heavy one
C	we wondered whether to bring everything down cos we're up dad was up looking for the curtains I was waiting to
B	oh right
C	receive them the other end
B	yes it
C	I thought oh well perhaps not so that'd be in the way
B	yes
C	oh oh did I?
B	yes you said I bought you that
B	and I said I know but
C	oh that's funny cos I don't remember that was that when we were here?
B	yeah yes I tried to give some away to charity but you got upset
C	oh
A	well you'll have to give it
B	but I can't keep them forever
C	no no er er
A	no
B	I can keep one maybe but I can't keep millions can I?
C	no no no
B	no
C	I gave up you know you gave me all those
B	mm
C	and there was nowhere to put them here
B	oh yes cos you had room didn't you?
C	and I gave them away but I'm always a bit upset I gave them away I sort of almost wish I'd kept them in a box in the roof space then
B	yeah
C	but it's silly because I'm not going to look at them
B	no and and
C	it's just sentimental
B	and in Wales you did have somewhere to put them there were those shelves weren't there?
C	yeah we did yeah that's it there wasn't wasn't there isn't much here really
B	no
C	erm but I'm sort of sorry I did anyway
B	yes
A	what shelves were those?
B	erm well there was one sort of a lintel piece above going into the lounge
C	yeah that's
A	ah yeah oh yes
B	down the stairs and then all the way up the stairs there were shelves weren't there?
A	through the
C	yes there were and utility room
A	yes that's right
B	yeah
C	that was a good house for six of us wasn't it?
B	yes quite spread out
C	had a lot of space kind of thing yeah
A	it was spread out yeah
C	and it was ideal really in that way
B	yes
C	er well anyway you can give the teddies away
B	yes
A	yeah
B	felt bad
C	I don't remember that
B	yes
A	and there's
B	well the Spanish ones I gave to
A	oh no no but English about English
C	oh did you? oh that's nice
B	yes because she's learnt Spanish but there's one
A	oh no in the roof space it's like
B	oh in the roof space ah
A	you know theory of language teaching type
B	oh right ah
A	more theoretical type books
B	oh right I don't remember those
C	and there's a French dictionary don't know if that's yours? by the bedside table
B	no
C	oh so
B	I didn't have any French the French ones'd be
C	oh oh I'll ask them then but must be
B	yeah
C	okay
B	Chinese might be
A	well no there there's there's
C	it'll be funny when we do sort the roof space out because we can
B	you're gonna have loads of room
A	well
C	yeah but there's things that are like there's one thing that's joint isn't there? it's that globe I think
B	I know
C	is still up there you've gotta decide what to do with that
B	yes
C	and there's a cuckoo clock isn't there?
B	yes I'd like to get that fixed one day there was something wrong with it wasn't there?
C	well we
B	oh did she?
C	yes I don't know if it was er quite right but she must have sorted it out and she decided to have it in her room and her Christmas present
B	well I think I just gave in didn't I? oh
A	probably yeah
C	seems a bit of a funny thing to do but anyway she she agreed that we'd have it repaired and that was her present
B	oh right
C	and she had it in her room in Wales for a few years
B	oh right
C	that must be up in the roof space now
B	yes
A	that would have gone then to her when she wanted everything sent to Australia
C	well yes
A	cos everything got packed
C	yes
B	and then she never took it did she?
C	no that was really strange cos I paid I mean don't tell her a hundred pounds
B	oh dear
C	for the contact but I mean she offered to pay but I
C	boxes came dad put them all together and he spent a whole day
B	dear
C	getting the stuff out of the roof space putting it in dad marked it all down
A	oh no it took more than a day to be honest
C	and then it stood in the hallway for ages and
A	yeah
C	and people were saying to me have you ever been to Australia? the pupils
B	dear
C	but no no and then we moved upstairs again out of the way and in the end she didn't want it
A	did the
C	and we had to unpack we couldn't put it back in the roof space
C	cos the boxes wouldn't fit up there we had to unpack it all
B	dear
A	oh the the big boxes didn't they
C	yeah yeah
B	oh did she want all of those?
C	she said that she was going to start practising the piano or keyboard could I send her out with some books cos it's so expensive to buy them out there
B	yes
C	send them out so I spent ages looking through couldn't find any of hers anyway
B	ah that's good
C	fifteen pounds
B	yes books are cheap usually to send cos I did that coming back from Japan
C	er second class
B	there was a special book rate
A	yeah
C	yes
B	as long as you only sent books
C	well fortunately I put the sender on the back so anyway she said could be up to three months it goes all the way out there now to be fair to
C	she had had that awful cancer diagnosis
B	yes
C	but anyway it said the books had arrived she never went to collect them
A	downstairs
C	and about two months later they all arrived back here
C	they've been all the way to Australia and back
B	dear that's cheap though isn't it?
C	but
B	fifteen pounds
C	that was pretty good I don't yeah
B	that's amazing mm
C	so
B	mm
C	but I think that was slightly different to the boxes because she was ill and that it obviously knocked her
B	yeah
C	but the other one was funny with the boxes but I think it's as well all the things didn't go out there
B	and she was moving as well
C	yeah she's never had room to put them
B	yes
C	anyway
B	dear
A	you'd be amazed what erm what's up there of yours
B	yes bet there's more clothes there must be
A	there's
C	and books I think second-hand books cos used to
B	mm yes
C	I used to get them you used to collect them didn't you?
B	mm
C	mm yes
B	cookbooks I've got which I'd like
C	okay
B	mm it's quite useful cos I've got the it's quite nice in the kitchen they've left two shelves haven't they? for
A	yeah
B	for things that's quite nice
A	yeah
B	one can be for books cookbooks
C	well
B	yes
B	well I'm going to give most of those away
A	yeah that's it you give away whatever but you know that's your that's your decision
B	but mum might get upset
C	no I won't get that's fine
A	and you give away whatever
B	do it when
B	mm I don't remember that one
C	that's
B	no no there's a turkey you gave me I don't
C	a turkey?
B	yes you got very upset
C	I can't remember
C	that's why it's a bit strange that I'd be upset
B	that's
C	if it was a the like she made
B	Postman Pat
C	Postman Pat
B	yeah
C	I might be a little bit sentimental about that
B	yes
C	cos she's not here
B	that's right
C	but I wouldn't be about other things
B	yes
C	I can't remember giving you a turkey
A	oh the Postman Pat was that
B	I think that was
C	was it?
B	yes
C	well that's what we'll do
B	no
C	it's just gonna get in a muddle you might as well have it when you're ready
B	yes it might as well be anything other than
C	clothes yeah
B	although I
C	boots yes yes
A	well I think I know
B	cos they were down here
A	yeah I think I might know where they are
C	ah yes
B	cos that would be useful if it's muddy
A	yeah
C	well no I've shown
B	the other thing I wanted to buy was my panniers cos I've got panniers haven't I for the bike?
A	they'll be in the roof space
B	yeah I won't get it today I'll I'll find erm
A	yeah
B	for now
B	goodness
C	it was just an instant decision that I was going to have some wellingtons so I went to
B	yes they're nice
C	oh oh right is that good is it? Dunlop?
B	oh yes yes same as the tyres
A	oh right mm
C	oh right and then if you pulled this you see pull it tight
B	ah yes good
C	whereas the other ones they do feel funny when you're not used to them don't they?
B	mm
C	yes I've tried them for walking but I mean they're not ideal cos I just walked round a mile
B	yes
C	it took me five minutes longer because you've got such a weight on your foot haven't you?
B	yes
C	but erm
B	yes that's good
C	yes
B	well what I could do today I think everything in the chest in that spare room
C	okay
B	I'll take some things out of there maybe
C	oh that's fine yes just do it slowly
B	yes
C	because otherwise you'll end up won't you with
B	piles of clothes
B	no
C	yes
B	that's true
C	mm
B	yeah
C	so I've started
B	no
C	cos I can let you you know take whatever you want slowly so I don't spent quite a while in the kitchen that's
B	oh that's good
C	well because it's getting such a muddle cos dad does the shopping but he tends to stockpile he forgets what he's bought
C	so I went up in the cupboards and there's so many different packets of tea
C	we've now got a whole draw of different
B	cor
C	so you don't need to buy any more tea
B	dear
C	yes
B	right mm
C	mm
B	at the supermarket they've got this scan as you go machine in Tesco have you seen those?
C	er
B	scan and shop it's called or something or shop and scan
C	yes I
B	yes I've tried it a couple of times now it's good
C	oh good
B	it does save you time at the end the first time it took forever because I didn't know how to do it
C	ah
B	but yes it was good
C	so what's what happens then? cos I've not
B	well as you go you scan the stuff and put it in bags in your trolley
C	yes
B	so you've already bagged it all
C	okay
B	and then at the end you don't have to take everything out and put it on the conveyor belt
C	oh right
B	you just pay
C	right that's a
B	so it's just on honestly basically
C	really? oh
B	they just assumed you've scanned it all
C	right
B	piles of smoked salmon for all they knew
C	mm yes
B	yeah that's it you just pay at the end
C	ah
B	you just wheel your trolley up but you don't take anything out
C	oh yes
B	yeah it's good
C	mm
B	yeah saved some time
C	no I don't do the shopping cos dad does but I I I
B	yes
C	because you go in there and you enjoy you think oh that looks nice I'll have that and you put it in and you look forward to eating it
B	yes
C	if you don't go through that process it's not the same
B	no
C	but I don't want to take it off him
B	but then I think sometimes it's nice to go through a cookbook in the same way
C	yes that'd be good and I do mean to do that
B	it's not the same on the internet
C	yes I'm always cutting out recipes
B	ah that's good
C	I don't try very many
B	mm yes
C	yes it's lovely
B	mm
C	yeah
B	it's good
C	well it's nice to be settled here isn't it?
B	yes
C	oh
A	you'll have to see what you want there
B	more boxes
C	it's like Christmas
B	dad's found the teddies I think
B	oh dear you don't wanna upset mum
C	no
B	ah
A	that might go in
A	so these would have been packed up when we moved here
B	yeah
A	so that that was packed
B	yes that's right I don't
A	oh grandpa
B	yes
A	you
A	yes
B	that one I don't know where that one's come from
B	this one you said grandpa got me when I was a baby
C	oh you see I'd forgotten he did did he? that's nice
B	oh I called it Stanley well I don't know
A	well that was Tradecraft I'd got you that
B	oh that's Tradecraft
C	oh don't be upset
B	you see this is the trouble you see they've all got stories
A	no no you
C	oh who gave you those?
B	that's nice isn't it?
C	that's a lovely one did I put
A	that's not bad
B	that one's not
A	that's good well perhaps I could
B	I expect you gave one each
C	you might
A	yeah it's terrible
B	I know
B	yes well I'll keep that's from grandma so I'll keep that one and that's I think from that is definitely a present from someone
C	okay that's nice
B	I really
A	you could have a
B	yes I could
B	I think the rest have to go though don't they?
C	I've got all the you know all the dolls that
B	I don't think they're all
C	well I was gonna say I don't know if they well I can't remember
B	give that to the new babies
C	yeah
A	yes
B	recycle some mum
C	oh yes
A	yeah
B	blue rabbit for a boy and a pink rabbit for a girl
A	oh yes they're different ones as well
C	and there's all those
A	that's a nice one
B	oh no I'll keep that one it's small
A	but that's very nice
C	who gave you that one? is that is that grandma?
B	I don't know this is sweet
A	yeah
C	yes
B	I'll keep that one cos it's small
B	and that one
A	take the box
B	no the rest shall we give to charity? these aren't all mine are
A	I don't know
C	no
A	I honestly don't know
C	all those dolls are great grandma's I had on display
B	I know
C	but I don't know what to do if they're in a box I bought a box especially a nice see-through one
B	yes
C	er and they're in the roof space but I can never give them away
B	oh no I don't think you can I thought you had and I was a bit sad
C	no
B	that she'd spent you know years collecting them
C	no
B	yeah
C	erm but
B	hey that's going to the charity shop
A	what do you want with that
C	okay that's fine
A	do you want us to do that?
B	well yes yes
A	are you happy to?
B	is that okay?
C	no that's fine
A	just take the books in
B	and if you want to give them to other people
A	yeah
B	then you can if you want to recycle the rabbits
A	yeah
B	there's no point having millions
A	no
C	I wonder who gave you this one then
B	I know it's nice isn't it?
C	yes
B	I don't remember that one
C	well it sort of rings a bell but I it's a long time ago now isn't it?
B	and that is not mine though
A	it's a bit like the Dulux dog colours
B	yes
C	but nobody's going to if I give it away and it was
B	I don't
B	I know but some of those aren't
A	that was your that was yours
B	that was mine yes Monty I remember Monty
A	yeah Monty I was trying to remember who what he was called
B	that one's not mine
C	oh right
B	I don't know why that one's there the rabbits are
C	they look very nice
B	very nice yes
C	yeah it was a long time ago though
B	yes
C	little
B	dear
C	I see
B	I know I saw that
C	yeah because I she asked me for one
B	yes
C	erm and as so I sent her a few I had ages ago cos of some sort of competition at work and she she didn't like them I think that's was when she was depressed and
B	mm I think she's quite sentimental isn't she?
C	is she? yeah
B	I think so well the fact she wanted all her childhood things that's quite
C	well yeah I suppose that's true
B	sentimental isn't it?
C	yes
B	or homesick
C	anyway she had them all there and I was looking at them and I don't know what I
C	so I've had two or three replies
C	so I've deleted it now you didn't see it
B	no I didn't see it no
B	no
C	you can easily upset people with Facebook couldn't you? I mean you look you think if
C	and they've decided to be mean or they just think it's nice and send it round
B	yes
C	very nice
B	that's right
C	that was a nice picture on the walk
B	yes they were good weren't they? they came out well
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yes it's good you sent a message to him as well
B	yes well he'd organised an
C	no yeah
B	he said he'd just joined the group himself but no one was organising anything so he did he said he'd be going out anyway
C	ah
B	yes yes I just thought that was nice cos he was
C	yes
B	you know didn't have to do that did he?
C	no I thought that was a nice sized group cos that walking group I've joined I'm not gonna go very often
B	yes
C	but it's far too big I think twenty people on a walk you know you see people out don't you? these big rambling groups
B	yes not the same
B	no it was a nice group and we didn't have to wait around for people
C	yes
B	so that was good
C	where did you meet them? in
B	no so they'd met in
C	it was before the suspension bridge yeah that's it
B	so I wrote to him cos he put a note about message me
C	yes
C	mm
B	and I'll tell you exactly where
C	yes
B	right so message me on Friday night so I did and he told me the name of the car park
C	okay
B	erm and just said google it but I looked on my OS map and it was there
C	yes
B	so I just went there and they were there so that was good
C	okay
B	I googled oh I didn't even google I just went on Facebook and put in
C	ah
B	you there's a search bar isn't there?
C	yes
B	where it says search for people but you can also use it to search for groups
C	oh can you?
B	so if you put in like
C	mm
B	it's quite clever I found a lot through that
C	oh did you? that that's very good
B	or Google as well sometimes
C	well yes
B	yes so I found that one cos a few months ago I started looking cos I knew I was moving
C	mm
B	so I just started searching and then if I found things on Facebook I just joined them
C	oh right
B	so that they I knew what was happening
C	oh yes
B	so like the
C	oh did you? yeah
B	but it's quite useful cos then I knew
C	yes
B	what was there what clubs what was happening
C	mm
B	just a bit easier
B	no
C	with you know cos there's things there aren't they?
B	right
C	so these groups where anybody can go along it's good isn't it?
B	yes
C	mm
B	it's not costing me money so that's nice
C	yes no
C	do you think there'll be another one?
B	I think that's going to be quite disorganised
C	right
B	by the look of it but
C	but you might not mind that if you're busy
B	no exactly so I don't know how often I'll be able to go though
C	well that's
B	cos if it's unlucky that
C	yeah
B	if they do a walk on the weekend where I'm doing my course then I won't be able to go and then that might be it for six weeks
C	is that the same group that went to
B	this is the
B	so that was unusual cos they did two in a row
C	oh right okay
B	apparently that was awful really badly organised
C	was it?
B	it was said seven miles
C	oh
B	but it was ten and they got lost and
C	oh dear
B	it was really muddy and people didn't have the right footwear
C	uhu
B	that group seems quite disorganised
C	oh yes
B	they said last year they had to call a helicopter out on
C	really?
B	cos someone had a heart attack in the group and
C	mm
B	actually knew they had a heart problem but didn't bother to tell anybody
A	oh dear
B	er yeah so now they put this huge disclaimer next to the walk by clicking on accept you are accepting all responsibility
C	oh right
A	yeah
B	we accept no responsibility for your health if you turn up with the wrong footwear it's nothing to do with us
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	but they have to I mean he could have sued that man couldn't he?
A	cos people complained
C	I know it's it's worrying what what it's like for people to running anything isn't it today?
B	there was a solicitor in the group yesterday and she said it's a really good disclaimer because it even says by clicking accept you accept these accept the invitation you are accepting the following conditions
A	yeah
C	mm
B	which is good
C	no no that's right
B	be qualified and carry all this extra equipment
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	in case and
C	yes
B	yeah that man was silly wasn't he? he should have told somebody he had a heart condition
A	yeah
C	yes
B	and obviously they would have told him
C	yes
B	in bad weather
C	it's good
B	yeah
C	with that one person
B	yes there was a nice lady yesterday actually
C	oh was there?
B	a German lady but she's been here about
C	yes
B	she seemed very nice and she said she hasn't been out at all the last two years
C	really?
B	she got divorced and was
C	ah
B	very upset about it and she's got two children
C	ah
B	but she said now her ex-husband had the children every other week
C	oh yes
B	but she's just been at home those last two years on those weeks
C	has she? oh yeah
B	but she decided
C	yeah
B	so that was good
C	yes
B	yes
C	oh did they?
B	and I said yes but you have to I said moving back to the UK is the same as moving to another country
A	yeah oh yeah
B	or moving anywhere in the UK is pretty much like moving abroad
C	is different
B	you have to go through the same
C	process
B	process
A	yeah
B	of joining a lot of things
C	yes I think so
B	and you may or may not like them but
C	yes
B	you're meeting people all the time
C	yeah and you you need to stick at them till you feel safe I think
A	yeah
B	yes
C	yes
B	ah yes
C	and
B	oh
C	and they're all over the country and the health visitor told me to go to and I went to
B	yeah
C	I mean it was worth it cos I joined it in two different moves and both times I met somebody
B	yes well that's good
C	from it and then I thought well I won't go to the group any more
B	yes
C	yeah
B	yes no it was good
C	yes
B	yes you're outdoors
C	yes
B	yes
C	yes there's lots of benefits aren't there?
B	yes
A	yeah
C	so
B	it's a twenty minute drive but on little lanes
C	okay
B	miles probably seven miles I would have thought
C	okay
B	I don't think you're quite high enough
C	oh
B	you can see the cliffs at
C	oh can you?
B	someone showed me them but I couldn't see the sea
C	yes
B	maybe you can though on a good day
C	you've got all that coastline to explore in the summer
B	mm
C	I quite you know I like Devon and Dorset coast along there
B	yes and there's a nice I saw on the map there's a
B	and there's a footpath all the way
C	oh is there?
B	north almost to the A thirty
C	oh right okay
B	that might be quite nice to do
C	oh yes
B	yes and nice pubs along the way
C	mm yes
B	as well around there saw some nice pubs
C	cos last time I did the
B	mm
C	the coastal walk on my own
C	there on that path sort of northwards
B	oh yes yes looks nice
C	yes
B	yes
A	really?
C	oh yes
B	yeah it's all S S S I round there
A	oh
C	it's a bit
B	oh right it's got the tram hasn't it
C	yes yes
A	it has a tram
C	you can go on it but I had a really nice bed and breakfast there
B	yes that's quite nice
C	and then
B	yes
C	but
B	yes
C	trouble is I've seen so much I can't remember where half the places probably are now
A	oh no
B	cos I thought oh they haven't sent me the letter this year every year they send me a letter saying you have to fill in your tax return and I thought well they didn't send it this year so that means I don't have to do it because last year the year before I actually didn't earn anything here
A	no cos the marking
B	because I did the no I didn't do the marking cos I was in Spain doing that course so I actually didn't do any marking so I put in zero zero zero zero for the whole year and I thought oh that's why they haven't sent it to me
A	yeah
B	this year because they've worked out I'm not earning anything
A	yeah
B	it's typical of them
A	that's no help
B	so the deadline in the thirty-first of January or I get fined
A	oh really?
B	so I filled it all in last night but I didn't have
A	Timbuktu
B	Timbuktu if they're open and told them they said they'll send it in the post so it will come here
A	oh right cos that's where your bank
B	well I've closed that account now but that's what they've got as the last address
A	yeah
B	so when you see it could you open it please?
A	so it'll say
B	well I hope so but often they don't do they now?
A	no they don't identify
B	they're just white envelopes so can you just keep an eye on the post? they said seven working days
A	and open it?
B	yes and maybe just take a photograph
A	yeah I'll photo it
B	it'll be net
A	yeah yeah
B	yes just a photo's fine
A	photo and send it
B	cos I need to get that done
A	and email it?
B	as soon as possible
A	well
B	well I've got to get it done by the thirty-first otherwise I'll get fined
A	and they said that the
B	it's better than getting fined
A	they said they'd send it in seven within seven days
B	seven working days
A	so it's probably not huge
B	oh it's tiny yes
A	yeah
B	I mean it's nothing it's just for in case they go through it
A	yeah
B	and say where is the paperwork?
A	mm
C	mm hm
B	yes very annoying they don't tell you you've got mail there
A	yeah
B	how are you supposed to know?
A	yeah
B	there doesn't even I mean I can understand they don't want to send the email
A	no
B	they could just send an email saying you have got
A	an alert
B	a secure message
A	yeah
B	mm mm
C	oh did they? oh that's quite
B	I said no I'm not doing A level this year
A	what's
B	I did it the last two years and it was awful
C	was it?
B	it's just ridiculous trying to read it on this you can only get it half the screen cos of their software and it's sixteen pages of that
C	oh right
B	and you have to go back and forwards
C	mm
B	it wasn't well paid GCSE pays less
C	no
B	but you can do it a lot faster
C	ah right
A	yeah
B	because they're short answers so sometimes they're
C	yes
B	I mean with GCSE you're often only looking for keywords
C	mm
B	and if they've got the keywords you don't read the rest you just give them the full marks
C	yes
B	they've got it it doesn't matter
A	mm
B	but with A level it's all in the detail
C	mm
B	and in the facts and
A	what subject was that?
B	geography
A	oh right
B	and it was the research paper
C	mm
B	yeah I'd and I you know you're supposed to cross reference it all you know blah blah blah says this how do I know?
C	mm
B	to cross reference things I'm not going to do it I'll I
C	oh yes
B	but mostly it's just annoying with the the screens
A	mm
B	trying to read an essay like that
A	yeah
C	mm
B	a third of the page on each one
C	yeah
B	I just didn't like it
C	well it's good you've got the GCSE
B	well I haven't yet but I I'm sure they will cos last year they were obviously very understaffed cos they
A	yes
B	saying will you take on another contract?
C	oh right okay
B	hopefully they will
C	you know I hope you're gonna have your job for at university
B	yes
C	erm you know next year as well
B	and there's a pension with that which is good
C	oh oh that's good
B	I pay one percent and they pay one percent I can also up it
C	ah that's good
B	and tell them I want I think up to four percent and they'll match it or something
C	so you haven't got a pension at the moment have you?
B	no I need to look into that
C	no so that's good

C	yes
A	yeah
B	they used to let you
A	yeah
B	I dunno if they still do you'd think they would wouldn't you?
A	they'd probably be there'll be a scheme
B	it'd be a bit silly if they didn't
A	yeah
C	yes
B	wasn't worth it
C	it wasn't worth it no because you're younger it'd be different
B	yes
C	yes
B	even if it's hundreds
C	yes
B	a couple of thousand
C	yes
B	or more it's probably still worth it
C	yes
B	yes I need to find out about that
C	yes it's really good so soon cos if you can keep that job at
B	yes
C	and yet
B	and they're flexible most people aren't
C	the rest is
B	they're not full time there most people they're working elsewhere and they're okay about that
C	oh are they?
B	so if you found better paid work in
C	yes
B	that's
C	oh right
B	another job two days a week
C	oh right
B	and they're on like point six or point eight
C	yes
B	and they college they don't mind
C	that's good isn't it?
C	mm yes
B	so that's
A	yeah

B	no
C	no
B	no I won't go back there
C	no okay
B	there's no point really
C	no
B	not for the money cos I'd be on almost the same money at
A	okay yes
C	ah yes of course
B	yes
C	mm
B	and have the weekends free
A	yes
B	and
C	what do they pay there then?
B	eight hundred a week
C	do they?
B	that's one of the best in the country though cos I looked
C	really? that's very good
B	but they they start hiring early I need to start looking from next month
C	and will that be like two or three month's work?
B	could be
C	okay
B	no that's the thing
A	no
B	but I need to work it out carefully
C	no
B	better off
C	mm
B	cos right now I'm employed till the twenty-second of April
C	yes
A	ah yes
B	but you see
A	yeah yeah
B	so then I'm
A	yeah
C	mm
B	but I'd have to work it out it might not it might work out that the pay is so good somewhere like
C	yes
C	mm
B	and saying I'm gonna have my month's holiday early
C	ah yes
B	cos you're not getting an August holiday are you?
C	mm
B	yes if I worked somewhere else you mean?
B	yes
C	that money
B	yeah well I suppose you don't know do you?
A	no
C	no
B	it's but then if I wouldn't be losing money anyway
C	no
B	if they're paying my accommodation in
A	no
B	cos I'm not
C	yes
B	paying rent in
C	no
A	no
B	so it's it's exactly the same actually
A	and if they
B	leaving the house
A	oh if they put accommodation in yes
C	mm
B	yes
C	then if you if you're letting the house out as well as going to
B	yes
C	you wouldn't definitely know
A	no no
C	no
B	you would fill it
C	mm you might not want
A	no
B	no
C	no
B	it'd have to be fully furnished wouldn't it?
C	mm
B	yes
B	now
C	mm
B	what are you doing this week?
C	I
B	ah that's good
C	but erm they're not

A	I've got Tuesday and Wednesday free
B	oh yeah
C	and in my late middle age
B	yes
C	like Thursday I could just get up and not have no plan at all just potter around
B	yeah
C	that doesn't happen very often
B	mm right
C	it's very therapeutic though isn't it?
B	yes it is
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
C	if if if you have a day completely out I think
B	mm
B	yes that's true
C	cos I think once the weather gets better you feel like doing a bit more
B	yes
C	yeah it is there's a lot before Christmas
B	hm
C	yes so I hope I find grandpa's house has dried out a bit more downstairs
B	I know
C	ah
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
B	can't next weekend cos I've got the course
C	no
B	so the weekend after
C	yes perhaps he'd like that
[ANNOTATION]	Person C said maybe he likes that	Entailment
B	maybe mention it put it on the board
C	yes what date would you think?
B	well it would be Saturday or Sunday
C	well
B	no no no leave leave it as it is
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person C agrees with Person B about Saturday or Sunday	Neutral
B	so I'll go Saturday
C	alright I'll put that on the board then so two weeks
B	yes
B	oh good yes
C	I was hoping you might
B	yes
C	cos he had actually a quiet Christmas really compared to normal
B	yes
C	because you were the only one out of the grandchildren that was here
B	yes it was funny wasn't it? it was
C	it it was strange I
B	well he's had this thing with the
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think it is funny and also strange	Entailment
C	yes and they've been ill
B	yes exactly
C	they could have gone after Christmas they
B	yes it was quieter
C	yeah and then actually from this side properly people don't normally come here
[ANNOTATION]	Person C said that properly people do not come in this side	Entailment
B	yes
C	so it was particularly quiet
B	yes
C	yes
B	yes
C	yes well he'll look forward to that
B	oh yes
C	I expect he will I expect he will it's nicer for him I think
B	yes
C	that's kind of you
B	yes you can ask him what he wants to do
C	yes
B	twelve
C	yes that's a good time isn't it?
B	yes
C	it won't take you too long to get there should be about an hour and it should be the same as coming here
B	ah right oh that's okay
C	yes
B	try not to get lost
C	yes well
B	yes
C	you've got good roads anyway
C	er it is over the moor yes
B	yes
C	they wouldn't go with that one cos it's so slow
B	ah right so go to
C	along the A thirty to
B	ah right then turn off
C	yes
C	so are you getting used to being back in the country now?
B	yes
C	how does it feel? cos it must be so different after all these years away
B	well
C	oh do they?
B	phase
C	ah
B	there's cos I learnt all about it with this course I just did
C	oh right okay
B	the the workshop
C	yes
B	and now when you come back you're initially in a honeymoon phase where you
C	ah yes
B	because you all the things you missed
C	yes
B	will be obvious to you so and then there's things that are different like the weather that you appreciate and things like that so I'm still in that phase
C	okay
B	and then after that they say that will wear off
C	yes
B	and then actually you can feel a bit down
C	ah right it's interesting to know
B	and then you pick up but yes the first
C	ah
B	it's all new and you're busy as well aren't you?
C	yes
B	so
C	but you've at least got the summer then well it's well it's well it's that's quite good
B	yes I was saying that to people they said oh you've come at the worst time of year I said not really actually because
C	not by
B	you've got something to look forward to
C	yes
B	and you're busy at first so
C	yes
B	by the time I get to that point where you know the novelty's worn off
C	yes
B	then we've got the nicer weather coming
C	yes
B	so actually I think it's a good time of year to be back
C	so you're fine with it though
B	yes
C	that's good
B	so that's good
C	I can remember coming back from Africa
B	yes
C	and it was I mean I had two years out in the bush and it was a very quiet night and I loved it it was really good
B	mm
B	yes
C	cos I had been living on a very low income
B	mm
C	and then I did adjust but then we moved to London with dad for his job but he was in London and I went there as well and that was
B	yes
C	from being out in the bush then I what two months later going round London and
B	yes so it was probably more of a change for you
B	yes for me I suppose
C	yes
B	but there's actually quite a lot going on here that I want to do
C	yes that's good you've got
B	that's good it's not there's loads going on it's just it's things that I like doing isn't it?
C	yes
B	so there's plenty of outdoors groups
C	yes that's good
B	erm the university's quite a good place to work cos there'll be things going on there
C	so it's better is it
B	all the time
C	mm
B	so that's good cos I do that anyway go to talks and things
C	used to before
B	yes
C	yes
B	in Abu Dhabi I went
C	yes
B	so that's yes
C	yes
B	yes
C	I think that's
B	yes
C	whereas the person who's at home you've gotta think oh you know
B	yes that's right they said that about you know the couple
C	ah right
B	that is more difficult for the wives
C	ah right
B	much more difficult
C	yeah
B	and in a way the husband is protected by the corporate culture which won't be that different
C	yes
B	to working at home
C	mm
B	you know it's the same rules isn't it?
C	yes
B	so they're not learning a whole lot of new rules again
C	no no
B	they were and they've got that structure
C	mm
B	but for the wives there's no structure
C	no no
B	and
B	they've got all this time to fill each day
C	very difficult
B	yes and if you're not into that anyway
C	no
B	cos I asked the lady
C	oh dear
B	what do you think you'll do?
B	I know
C	oh
B	she's gonna come home quite a lot but in way that can make it difficult to settle
C	to settle
B	yeah I think three years quite a long time three years
C	yes
B	yes I think she needs to think
C	yeah
B	and there's only so much shopping you can do she said she likes shopping but I mean even if you go
C	yes
B	three hours a day I mean
C	yes
B	it's not that's not even half the day isn't it?
C	yes
B	mm
C	to start with it's like a honeymoon going over that
B	yes
C	and now she's been there a bit longer I mean she sounds fine but she doesn't do very much
B	no and she's gone quiet cos she used to email me quite a lot and it's gone quiet
C	ah she has gone quiet so that that could be part of it
B	so it's a bit like
C	yes
B	mm
C	so she I mean the email sounded bright and cheerful but all she seemed to be doing was going to the pool and the gym well
B	yeah
C	she's got friends
B	yes and she was working before so it was different
C	yes yes that's it it would be very different
B	mm
C	but maybe it's not for long?
B	no
C	well that's it we don't know if
B	yeah
C	or if she's not well with the treatment don't know do you?
B	no
B	mm
C	well the last time I saw spoke to her she and that was
B	oh right
C	yes I think so
B	mm
C	because it does terrible things to you doesn't it?
B	that's basically poison isn't it?
C	yes
B	I know
C	and then what was she doing about work? because she seems to be doing hardly any work when I spoke to her
B	I don't think she's
C	I don't know cos she
B	well she told you actually to she was getting insurance money
C	she told me that she was trying to take a pension out
B	yes well I think she's got it
C	right
B	so in that sense financially she must be fine
C	yes
B	well
B	yeah I think she's got to think about the next twenty years not the next
C	right
B	plan a bit shorter time hasn't she?
C	I suppose I suppose so I suppose to be realistic yes
B	she's better off thinking about the next ten
C	yes
B	years
C	yes
B	cos at the end of the day if you were really destitute aged sixty the government's got no choice but to help you
C	well I was gonna say surely you've got this
B	so it's the people in between who suffer isn't it?
C	yes
B	the people who have some money
C	yes
B	and then the government won't help you cos they say look you've got all this equity and you could sell your house
C	yes
B	the people who are best off are those who are either comfortably well off
C	yes
B	and have the pension
C	mm
B	and the government must help you
C	yes
B	so she shouldn't worry
C	no
B	yes
C	half the rent anyway
B	yes
C	yeah so we don't know how she is at the moment
B	no
C	I sent an email
B	ah right
A	it's getting lighter a bit each day isn't it?
B	yes it's a bit better isn't it? what time is it now? four o'clock yes a bit better
C	would you like another cup of tea?
B	I would and I wouldn't mind looking for my wellingtons could we go and have a look for those?
A	ah yes
C	alright
C	mm my box
B	yes can you please remember I'll send you a text about the HSBC
A	oh yes please send a text
B	yes they didn't come but it could be
A	yeah
B	what and I'll just tell them I made a mistake if they're ever
A	yes
B	they usually don't I mean it really is going to be a couple of pounds they don't normally
B	ah yeah
B	ah
C	size forty?
B	well I don't know about forty
A	hello?
B	hello?

B	but
C	I'll have a quick whip though shall I in a minute for you?
A	mm
B	mm
A	they'll be in the front room probably
B	mm
A	that's I think that's where the waterproof jacket is
B	yes there's a waterproof jacket which is not mine
A	what a green one?
B	mm
A	wasn't yours green?
B	no my waterproof jacket I have
A	yeah
B	it's blue
A	oh yes
B	ah yes trapped
C	is that waterproof jacket the one I gave you
B	yeah
C	is it is it
B	no not entirely

B	no that green one's probably better
C	yes
A	have you got a blue one?
B	yeah mum gave me it
C	yes it was
A	oh yes that's them yes
B	yeah
C	yes
A	er there's one just inside the roof space at the top of the big
B	mm yes
A	a a sort of sky blue colour
B	oh I don't know whose that is?
A	or no it's got more of a thickness to it
B	oh yes it's a ski jacket that is mine
A	ah
B	but that's not really suitable for walking
A	no no
B	not long distance cos it's hot
A	too heavy
C	well do you want to borrow that green one?
B	is that your what one there? two?
C	and there's two I think one of them is mine which I
B	yes one of them is yours yeah

C	yes
B	that will be useful
C	okay
B	it is yeah you bought two identical ones

C	and your and your upset because you didn't get one
B	I never got one
C	no
B	yes it's fine just for work
C	yes
B	get wet
B	yes I did get quite wet yesterday
C	well I was gonna say that it isn't
A	yeah
C	really a walking
C	we bought them for when we were going on cruises and we're in
B	yes they're good I mean they're fine in a shower
C	in the Mediterranean there's a shower and we can have it in our little rucksack cos
B	yes they're good cos they fold up very small
C	oh
A	oh for a shower
B	mm
A	if
C	yes
A	that's you know cos it's between
C	yes
A	but if you're actually erm like sightseeing but if you're actually out on a Dartmoor type walk
B	yeah
A	where you're all exposed for three hours then
C	mm
A	and there's no there won't be any warmth to it
B	yes I I tested that yesterday and it was
B	no I didn't get soaked it did stay waterproof for quite a long time
C	well that's not bad for
A	yeah
B	and I didn't get that wet but I did get wet
A	yes
B	in the end
C	while we were looking for curtains the only thing dad found but I told him it
A	boring
A	off white
B	yeah
C	but there always seem to be well I suppose they are the right person to get entangled up
C	do you want those
B	well probably not unless I bought the fabric in which case
A	yeah
C	yes
A	no then it won't fit yeah
B	no that's true
C	but it's gonna be interesting sorting out the roof space cos we came here and just you know gave away a lot of things so we had far too much of our own things
A	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah but you know we've got things up near our house we don't want so
A	not much
C	no
A	there's not much of ours up there
C	no
B	who knows what's up there?

A	yes
A	that's that's in recent years it's not that incredibly old
C	yes and there's a few of my things that
A	yeah
B	well there's a bit of my stuff in the spare room still
A	yeah
B	the wardrobe doesn't have my things in in the spare room the back room
C	no
B	that's not mine

C	oh yes
B	and the chest of drawers the
C	middle yes
B	the bottom's empty
C	mm

C	ah yes
B	but then the trouble is carrying it
A	yeah
B	yet they don't sell drying racks at all
B	no sort of drying rack
A	no
B	and only one ironing board which was forty pounds I was like well ironing boards can't cost forty pounds

A	yeah that's it
B	but it's a choice of one
A	yes
C	mm
A	well that's it it just got that one there
B	yeah and then other things like adaptors

A	you know it's not a DIY shop so
B	no
C	have you got
B	oh yes I've still got yours
