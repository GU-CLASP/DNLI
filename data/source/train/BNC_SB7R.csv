B	yeah
A	like that there was a carrier bag but it was shredded

A	the seed she's got well I think so
B	yeah go on then
A	the seed that she's using is in a Tupperware but then er after that she's got a big bag that's just in a carrier bag and I think it was that anyway there were no mouse droppings but there was there was shredded bits of carrier bag inside the bag of seed
B	oh really? oh it's all wet there
A	no he's not too bad I just felt under his chin you put this on in case you keep dribbling little man? mm? yeah so I did tell her I wasn't gonna tell her

A	but I went back today with a tin
B	batteries are going on that
A	oh yeah they are are I went with a tin to put the bag of seed in so it can't get into the tin

B	well as long as you're happy and smiling look we've got three scratch mitts here so that's an odd number then we've got one that doesn't match anything and then we've got two blue ones so I don't know what we've done with it
A	is he still sleeping well at night?
B	oh here's another white one erm yes cos she's she's keeping him awake more in the day and he's done ever so well today and he hasn't been asleep at all hardly
A	well this is the problem though cos it's only half past three he'll probably fall asleep at like five o'clock and then he won't go to sleep
B	she lets him have an hour then and that's it
A	oh does she?
B	yeah and wakes him up
A	then and then wakes him up
B	and then she's does him his bath and but he's going down at about eight o'clock in the evening
A	oh brilliant
B	but he sleeps till about four four thirty
A	right
B	but she was keeping him awake till sort of ten
A	oh
B	and then two and then
A	so she they may as well have a bit of an evening if they
B	yeah
A	just have a couple of hours
B	so she's doing eight o'clock now and she says he's absolutely shattered by the time it comes to his bath and that and he's falls asleep
A	ah
B	on his bottle and he stays asleep till
A	four?
B	yeah but she's not
A	oh it's a
B	I don't think she she does feed him then yes yeah cos he started waking up in the night and so she was just trying to water and
A	and do they still?
B	dummy and
A	is it still six months before you're supposed to put them on solids cos it changed didn't it?
B	they say that but I don't think she's gonna leave him that long she was in the erm clinic the other day I think probably the weighing clinic and er
A	oh
B	there we go again
A	oh shall we sit you up? what is going on with that milk?
A	it is whoops

A	oh wow
B	so the following day I went in and all the
A	oh
B	no
B	no of course he doesn't
B	so he read the thing again and it it said it did say two to three hours
A	oh
B	but then a bit further if using in a shower allow twenty-four
A	well
B	hours
A	what as opposed to a bath? where it doesn't actually maybe get wet around the top
B	okay so I said alright then
A	maybe yeah
B	so he grouted again and then I used the shower in the bathroom
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B took a bath in a bathtub.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	and then another day on it said yeah yeah it'll fine to use so I used it and all the grouting came out
A	oh no
B	and I've used it every day since and all it's done is is grout going everywhere he says oh it doesn't really matter because it's quite old I could get some more grout I says why are you even bothering? why don't you just get on with the job I asked to do which was repaint?
B	can we just leave the grouting alone now? so I just come out covered in grout
A	oh no
A	well that's good exfoliation I expect

B	it's crazy cos it's this chunky
A	yeah good exfoliation coming out the wall yes
[ANNOTATION]	Cleaning the grouting takes much time.	Neutral

B	yeah
A	I dunno what they've booked for you
A	so if it's right on the doorstep
A	er yes
B	they've just booked the most expensive
A	I know ridiculous anyway
B	they've
A	probably
B	or something stupid like that
A	so he's going he's he's gotta be up at five gotta be at the airport at six or something stupid
B	right
A	he's been given the itinerary so he's got to be up at er and he wants to be up and out really at five o'clock or just after
B	yeah
A	and then he says on the itinerary we're not having dinner till eight o'clock at night I mean how?

A	I know that's what I said
B	so
B	yeah not too bad
A	I said I'd have needed about five meals by then

A	yeah
B	right
A	ridiculous ridiculous

B	checking the snow of course
A	oh daily
B	what time's the flight then? you said you'd looked and then
A	I did look and now I can't remember
B	you can't no
A	but I know that we're not gonna get to the hotel till really it's like a a three-hour transfer
B	what? it's not a three-hour how many hours that because according to
A	from Sofia Airport?
B	do you know we'd probably cheaper having a taxi oh but there's the
A	it's two it's two hours forty-five minutes I think
B	well
A	that's what it says on the thing so and I don't think
B	oh
A	I know
B	three hours on a coach
A	yeah
B	it's a three-hour flight as well isn't it?
A	yes so we're not gonna be there till getting on for midnight they're two hours ahead aren't they?
B	yeah
A	so it would be ten o'clock so it would be seven o'clock
B	yeah
A	so the flight would be is the flight about half past two or something?
B	yeah I don't think it'll be too late
A	half past two half past three half past four half past five so that would be half seven already
B	yeah
A	so I'm allowing half an hour for luggage and eight nine
B	oh for well I I I can get up any time of the following day

A	coming to tea?
B	now I didn't store the number

B	well
A	you could do
B	then I always think that could be a while looking back on the old log
A	yeah
B	oh no I can't that's being used but I
A	you could google it that would be as easy wouldn't it? or we could just go up there it's just up the road it is master
B	yes it would be as easy to google it
A	it would
B	let's have a look won't be in mail
A	tell me
A	have you been swimming yet?
B	yeah
A	you have?
B	been under the water and everything
A	did you like the water? which swimming pool were you in?

B	but they both went last Sunday and think they're going again tomorrow they've asked
A	oh auntie
A	she is she's like a fish
B	ah
A	fish
B	yes
A	or as we're learning on this little
B	if you just go call from there does it charge you?
A	I don't know
B	don't know
A	so did you like swimming? did you have armbands and a rubber ring?
B	so it's next Saturday and it's six thirty
A	no
B	put it on the shared?
A	oh I haven't looked on the Ipad actually is it on the stream?
B	has she put? I I dunno what what stream are we on the same?
A	no I didn't see haven't seen the picture yet
unknown_female	hello
B	are we on the same oh hello there could I book a table please for next Saturday the thirtieth?
unknown_female	of course yeah what sort of time were you thinking?
B	erm six thirty
B	well there there's gonna be eight of us but then there's also gonna be a baby and a pushchair is that is that okay? I was wondering if erm we could maybe go on the other side that was quieter you know you normally see everybody on the on the right hand side? I'm thinking we it might be easier with the baby
unknown_female	I can do a table of eight at half six
B	yeah
unknown_female	the only issue is I'm going to need it back for about quarter past eight
B	oh that's fine yeah yeah
unknown_female	is that alright?
B	that's okay yeah
unknown_female	no worries
B	we'll done by quarter eight won't we
A	we will
B	no it'll probably just be his pram to be honest cos he's only erm he's not quite three months old yet so
unknown_female	okay no no no worries at all
B	so if if I'm thinking if we've got a bigger space where we can just put the pushchair that's why I was thinking if it's the other side of the restaurant perhaps
unknown_female	yeah no perfect
unknown_female	erm the so you may as you walk in the left hand side?
B	yeah
unknown_female	no worries
B	that'll be great then yeah
unknown_female	and can I take your name and contact number for yourself?

unknown_female	and the contact number if you would
