B	so I did erm literature modules and well I was doing English and creative writing
A	oh that's cool no you weren't surely?
B	I was I was awful so then I got like a third in it
B	in a module so I was like
A	that is pretty bad
B	I was like I should probably drop this
A	yeah
B	I'm not so good at this one
A	ah bless
B	erm but yeah no so dropped it and then I so my degree is kind of just BA English
A	yeah
B	cos I didn't really do anything yeah
A	that's cool though it's nice to be varied
B	yeah
A	did you prefer the literature? or the? obviously you preferred the
B	the linguistics
A	I don't either
B	no
A	I can't think of anything more boring than doing an English literature degree
B	I was so glad that we don't we don't have to do all that stuff
A	no
B	and then like I met a couple of girls who were doing stuff like English from like the eighteenth century I'm just like really? how do you?
A	how boring
B	how many? well I've only lived back there for like since erm May but I've always kind of lived there cos I was only at uni somewhere else so
A	okay so maybe write that down if you can like
B	okay er
A	moved back in May but have lived there X amount of years or something
B	yeah moved back erm so what was May? like four months ago
A	yeah so I mean June July August September nearly finished September haven't we now? so yeah four months
B	five months four
A	four four or five months
B	four
A	again I don't think they'll call you up
A	our records show
B	yeah
A	something different
B	how long exactly?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but you've always lived there
B	not always
A	no but for
B	yeah
A	longer than four months
A	where did your dad meet your mum then? out of interest
B	my dad was a nurse
A	oh
B	he came over here to be a nurse
B	and then my mum he was like the ward supervisor and
A	oh so he was the boss?
B	yeah
A	so she was sleeping with her boss
B	exactly
B	disgusting really
B	have lived er
A	are they still together your parents?
B	no
A	no have they remarried?
B	yeah both of them have
A	yeah
B	which is nice

B	no
B	only both second marriage
A	my mother's on her
B	is she?
A	yeah
B	is he nice?
A	yeah he is
B	that's a difficult age to for your parents to get divorced
A	yeah it was about sixteen actually it was difficult yeah
B	I feel like it's more difficult the older you get
A	kind of went er had I had I left home I reckon it would've been easier
B	mm
A	if I'd already gone to uni but it happened at like sixteen just when I started my A levels kind of thing and I went off the rails I didn't
B	really?
A	didn't really go to school or anything yeah
B	oh my gosh
A	my attendance was less than twenty percent for the whole two years
B	that's awful
B	and you were still doing that? you kept that up?
A	well they kind of made me
A	they kept like blackmailing but I from year nine to year eleven I wanted to so I I was like the lead role in Joseph and I was also
B	oh
A	oh god it's embarrassing now
B	that's one of my favourite ones
A	but erm so I was in about ten musicals
B	can you sing?
A	yeah I can sing
B	oh that's cool
A	mm not amazingly but I can sing but then when it got to the sixth form I didn't really wanna do it any more and I ended up getting roped into Grease and West Side Story and
B	oh my god
A	Sweet Charity just by
A	but they kind of told me you have to be in them
B	I was in Joseph but I was just like
A	were you?
B	cos erm at my school we used to do musicals er like every year
A	yeah
B	like nothing serious
A	no
B	just you know I was erm in Joseph I was like you when you're like an extra? so you play about a million parts
A	like a chorus yeah
B	so I was like in the choir and I was one of the wives and I was
A	oh that's cool
B	and I was a cheerleader cos it was like a modern Joseph
B	and
B	yeah it was awesome
A	did you enjoy it?
B	yeah I loved it
A	was that the only play you were in? or did you do some other stuff as well?
B	erm that was the only play I was in I used to do a little bit of drama but I'm not very good at it
A	they were quite serious at my school like
B	really?
A	we probably did two or three big productions a year and we were trying to become a performing arts college
B	oh yeah
A	which they did the year I left so all the money that I helped to raise was to get this grant to do that but I mean Joseph we did it in year nine I got the lead role just as I'd come to the school
B	mm
A	and then we redid it in year eleven and took it to Germany so
A	I ended up doing that and West Side Story in Germany
B	you went to Germany?
A	yeah and I mean I was performing to a thousand people a day
B	that's crazy
A	for like four or five days in a row with Joseph
B	was it really tiring?
A	yeah oh yeah
B	when I think when I go and see plays in
A	oh it's really tiring
B	like how does anyone have a life
A	you have to be careful
B	yeah
A	you like wear you wear yourself out really quickly
B	oh
A	I had to do quite a few stage kisses as well
A	it's tough cos one of the girls I really fancied
B	oh no
A	erm I really fancied for years before and I never got with her and then by the time it came round I got put in a main part with her in a in a Spanish play called Blood Wedding
B	oh okay
A	and I was meant to be this Italian stallion
A	that like or Spanish stallion who like swept her
A	I used to really fancy her but she had the smelliest breath
B	oh my god that's horrible
A	it was horrible
B	that's awful
A	I used to have to kiss her I had to do it like five nights in a row I was like oh god no more please
A	well you're a supervisor now aren't you?
B	I am a supervisor actually
A	yeah write it down put it in ink
B	can I put that?
A	yeah
B	look it was so nice to tick all those boxes
A	it is nice isn't it? yeah
B	secondary school college graduate and postgraduate
A	I've got quite a few people that just tick the first one and then they're like ah kind of makes me feel a bit bad
A	cool
B	topic
A	what are you on then there? what do they pay a supervisor?
B	oh rubbish I get like seven pound thirty or something
A	oh no
A	it's better than nothing yeah
B	er it's okay but they were like
B	you get like seven pound thirty and I was like wahoo
A	yay wahoo an extra pound
B	yay
A	for quite a bit more responsibility I would imagine yeah
A	at least you get a pay rise I mean some people er
B	mm
A	take the extra positions but don't get the extra money
B	yeah but they're and they're like it's just for the experience
A	yeah
A	they're just taking the piss aren't they? at that point
B	what's our topic of recording?
A	erm well we've already spoken about quite a few things so I'd just say various just write various there
B	various have you done this with
A	mm hours I already have about sixty
B	oh wow
A	so yeah
B	do you have to get a certain amount? are you like some sort of ambassador for it?
A	erm no no we've just gotta get as much as we can so they would like to kind of get about five hours with each person if possible
B	oh my god
A	so if you have any other free times and you you're like
B	yeah I'm always free
A	I mean I'm always free at this time now don't commit but if
A	if next week or the week
B	yeah no I'm usually around
A	after or any other week you you
B	have you done the work for this lecture?
A	erm right what did we have to do? we had to read the the really rude article and then that other article
B	oh yeah
A	did you read that one? I fucked my sister slowly
A	and all this kind of shit it's like it got a bit dodge
B	I didn't really I didn't I er preferred the other one
A	yeah I did that one too
B	did you read the other one?
A	the one about the swearing? the one I'm talking about?
B	no there was two and then there was like one more that they didn't say to read did you read it?
A	I think he put that out by mistake
B	I read it and I was like what
B	the hell
A	she said
B	is this?
B	oh my
A	it's socio-linguistics I'm pretty sure like some kind of language variation cos I briefly looked over it
B	I was really I was really it was really boring and like technical and I was just like am I meant to read that?
B	just like wasted like five hours of my life trying to understand this article
A	I reckon he put that up by mistake
A	he seems nice
A	he seems like a really nice guy but he's a bit all over the place
A	so we had to read one of those and then evaluate it didn't we? certain like what the arguments were
B	yeah and we had to read that how to read article
A	yeah
B	and then read that like
A	and we also had to come up with a dissertation idea didn't we?
B	yeah what's yours?
A	did you do that?
B	yeah I kind of did I was just doing it in the library before I met you but I don't really know what I don't know er I wanted to do like erm you know in Malaysia I dunno if it's the same where you've been but like erm my dad and all my family and everyone in Malaysia basically uses like the suffix like la after everything like they'll always
A	okay
B	yeah they're always like erm oh no la like they'll always say la after everything and I think it's like and I was reading about it
A	yeah
B	cos it's really interesting like in what sort of situations it happens but I think every article on the internet is wrong to be honest
A	okay
B	I've read loads and I was like
A	that's a great topic
B	and I was like I've been there and that's not right I know it's not right and I know it's not right and
A	no they're generalising
B	so a lot cos a lot of them were like oh blah blah er they only use it in this situation and I was like they use it all the time
A	all the time
B	like
A	what does it mean then that suffix?
B	it doesn't really mean anything
A	no
B	it just it's just like a emphasis I guess
A	like a discourse marker type of thing yeah
B	yeah it's not even it's not even anything my dad doesn't do it now
A	is it kind of like do you get me?
B	yeah it's kind of like that
B	someone will I'll be like like if my sister if my dad's sister and he were talking erm he'll say oh you know she'll be like oh
A	oh okay
B	and he'll be like oh no la like
A	kinda like the Canadian A
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah I guess so
A	no I like that A do you like that A?
B	erm but I was
A	well that's perfect isn't it? you've found a perfect topic
B	I was kinda like I wanna go there and do my research
A	yeah
B	and then I started looking at flights
A	yeah
B	and then my whole afternoon just disappeared
A	and you've got family and everything out there that can put you up?
B	mm yeah but my family are a bit weird they're all
A	why are they weird?
B	my auntie like a couple of them they're all really religious why's it suddenly gone dark?
A	yeah I know it's like it's gonna rain or something yeah
A	please don't rain
A	no okay
B	so
A	so you feel a bit uncomfortable around them
A	but to go over there and do some research
B	yeah it'd be so good
A	you could get they'd put you up and you could live with them yeah
B	I would love that I was looking at flights I was thinking I could go like maybe in the Easter holidays then that's probably too late but er this isn't due like till September is it?
A	no it's not till September I don't think we're meant to begin collecting our research until we finish the second semester so I reckon
B	oh right
A	you probably need to know what you're doing and maybe have a literature review and all that kind of stuff
B	cos we
A	sounds like a great idea
B	it'd be so good
A	and I mean as they want people to be researching other languages as well
B	yeah
A	you've got a
B	think so
A	thank you very much you've given me your soul wah ha ha
B	I didn't even read this bit to be fair
A	you can read it if you want to
B	mm it's alright
A	it's all boring waffle waffle
B	I'm sure it'll be I'm sure it'll be fine
A	yep thank you
B	I missed a lecture last week cos for some reason it didn't show up in my timetable
A	oh no
B	and I erm
A	which subject?
B	erm discourse and
A	yeah I don't know
B	discourse of social and personal identity
A	oh that's very neat isn't it?
B	isn't that
A	you're very very organised
B	I thought it was pretty good
A	you have to be at this level don't you?
B	yeah
A	how does this uni compare to your last uni? like with what they expect from you and all that kind of stuff have you noticed a step up from
B	I don't really yeah I don't really know yet because I feel like I haven't really met any of the lecturers on like a
A	yeah
B	but at my old uni I I dunno yeah like a lot was expected from me but like I just got on really well with most of my tutors so it was fine so
A	yeah
B	I used to go also I like doing things that are a bit different so I used to have ideas for like essays and stuff which wouldn't be like the kind of standard stuff and they'd love that they were like oh yeah like doing something different that's really cool
A	oh that's good
B	but I dunno whether they'll like that here
A	erm they're quite they're renowned for being a left wing university here aren't they?
B	yeah
A	so maybe you've come to the right place
B	hope so
A	maybe if you do that kind of stuff
B	I hope so
A	push the boundaries
A	so you haven't you haven't even been to that class yet then? the discourse of social and personal identity
B	no how bad is that?
A	is that an undergraduate module that one?
B	yeah I think so
A	yeah
B	I emailed her
A	so you're doing two undergraduate modules?
B	yeah
A	what's the other one?
B	forensic
A	oh yeah you did say that
B	that was quite good though it's a bit weird
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	I I was interested in it but I just thought it's very narrow
B	mm
A	kinda like
B	I don't know anything
A	but then I'm doing syntax
B	I don't know anything about it
A	and that's extremely narrow
B	mine's like
A	oh god
B	and then
A	it's like legalese and all that kind of stuff
B	yeah I was a bit like
A	mm?
B	I wanted to write about Judge Judy
A	are you a fan are you?
B	I am a fan
B	but apparently that's not well I don't think that there's room for that
A	you're not allowed no okay
B	but I thought I thought I could do really I was like yeah
A	okay
B	it'd be such a good essay
A	yeah
B	and I was like oh
A	did you bring it up in class?
B	no
A	no okay
B	I was like I don't think that's really
A	this isn't gonna fit do you find it a bit weird being with undergraduate students? or?
B	no
A	I suppose the age difference isn't too
B	is her name
A	oh she's in that as well?
B	erm and I think she might be in my other one as well but no cos a couple of
B	in forensic linguistics there's a couple of part time masters people as well
A	oh okay
B	so I sat with them last week but they were like
B	they had you know when they have that knowing look about them where they're like just you wait
A	it's coming
B	they were like so you're doing a masters in
A	yeah
A	so I must've chosen the weird modules that nobody wants to do then cos I've done two undergraduate modules also pidgins and creoles and syntactic theory I'm the only masters student in in both classes
B	are you really?
A	so
B	I was gonna do syntactic theory but erm
B	then she put me on
A	bet you'd be glad you didn't
B	I said I'd prefer to do is that really boring?
A	it's it's not really boring it's very conceptual
B	yeah
A	it's very like and er the the problem I've got like the first class I felt I knew what I was talking about and I could
B	mm
A	I felt a little bit under everyone
B	are they so when er they say undergraduate module are they third years?
A	they're third years yeah
B	yeah okay
A	third years so they're final year undergraduate I thought it was a bit strange that we can take undergraduate modules
B	yeah I know
A	and they kind of asked me how come you
A	I was like
B	cos they haven't got enough for us probably
A	yeah
A	well I was like it's cos I'm doing you know more modules I presumed that they were doing only three modules cos in my university we did three modules a semester
B	yeah we did four
A	you did four
B	yeah
A	they're doing four here
B	oh are they?
A	yeah I guess
A	it's definitely a different standard here
B	is it?
A	like yeah I er looking back I realise how the standard was definitely lower at
B	do you think so?
A	yeah I think so
B	I think sometimes I get pieces of work back and I think that definitely wasn't a first and I got given a first
A	you got a first oh
B	not overall like
A	yeah what did you get overall?
B	two one
A	two one
A	which percentage?
B	oh only like er well like sixty-five so comfy
A	yeah that's good yeah a good solid two one
B	yeah I did really
A	I got sixty-seven
B	that's really good
B	I did really badly in my second year I don't know why I was working like in a shop and I worked
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then I don't really know what happened but something made me freak out and I was like I really don't wanna leave this uni with a two two that'd be awful
A	no
B	so I was like okay
A	thank god you didn't
B	I know I was like you really need to step it up so I like in my third year I didn't work so I had loads more time
A	yeah yeah yeah it's important isn't it?
B	erm and I like pulled my grade up like in second year I finished on a fifty-eight I think? and er
A	and finished on a sixty-five that's a big
B	and yeah
A	big pull up
B	and and in third year I think I actually like got like er overall like obviously cos it levels out but I think I got like a sixty-eight so I pulled it up like a good ten marks so I was like
A	nice so you must've got a couple of firsts in there yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They finished with a 65 and that's big.	Entailment
B	yeah I did I got a first on a Shakespeare essay
A	oh wow
B	that was my proudest moment
A	I can't stand Shakespeare
B	that was my best moment
A	I got one first in my entire degree
B	and what was that?
[ANNOTATION]	They got first on the Shakespeare essay.	Entailment
A	I was consistently hitting sixty-fives to sixty-sevens like the whole time
B	yeah I was the same
A	but like I got one for it was er it was the module was called into print
B	mm
A	so the whole idea of the module was to get published in as many things as you could
B	oh that's cool
A	and I I wrote quite a bit for my university magazine
[ANNOTATION]	The module was published in many things as possible.	Neutral
B	was it like a competition?
A	yeah I mean effectively yeah to a certain degree it was
B	that's really good
A	yeah erm so it was all about you know how you approach publishers and how you do all that kinda of stuff
B	yeah
A	and erm I through that module I ended up being the music editor for my university magazine
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	It wasn't like a competition.	Contradiction
A	cos I wrote for them and then I took over the job I won a short story competition
B	that's so good
A	erm I also won er another well actually I came as a runner up in a competition but the winner couldn't do it so do you know Ents24?
B	no
A	it's like See Tickets or like Ticketmaster
B	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Its something like ticketmaster.	Neutral
A	it's like this kind of thing
B	okay yeah yeah
A	so they had a competition they came to our uni and said you know we're gonna ask people to write some pieces and and if you win the competition then we're gonna send you off to review these bands so
B	wow
A	I had to go and interview the bands afterwards do you know Kosheen at all?
B	no
A	they're like er ah you'd like them I think they're like electronic dancey female singer
B	yeah?
A	good lively band I had to go and interview them at
B	that's so good
A	so yeah I got seventy-two in that module
B	that's a pretty good module isn't it? cos it's kind of like preparing you for for real life
A	yeah it's vocational isn't it? you've gotta go out and do the actual thing yeah
B	definitely
A	but I went to uni to do drama not to do creative writing
B	how did you end up doing
A	because well I told you I did terribly in my A levels
A	like two grades and but the year I after I went they changed the grades and brought the grades up so I kind of got in
B	just before yeah
B	oh no
A	and I was like this is really boring so er I started I ended up doing a major minor so I minored in drama and majored in creative writing
B	oh did you? oh that's cool that's really good
A	mm
B	did you do like scriptwriting and stuff?
A	yeah I did do a module on scriptwriting
B	were you interested in that?
A	I was yeah but the script that I wrote was a bit erm in your face out there I don't know if I think my lecturer liked it but I think everyone else just thought I was weird so I kind of
A	made me feel a bit strange afterwards looking back
B	yeah
A	had a good degree though I enjoyed it
B	I almost did a whole degree in creative writing I'm very glad I didn't
A	yeah
B	cos I didn't do very well in that so er
A	why didn't you do well? what was what was wrong with your writing?
B	just cos it was like erm I can't write poetry and it was
A	ah I never took any poetry modules
B	and it was loads of poetry and and I was
A	did you not have a choice?
B	it was only poetry and short stories and that was it
A	oh
B	and like I think there was like a
A	yeah
B	module and then in third year there was like a radio drama module
A	yeah
B	erm which I I'm not interested in either
A	no
B	so I was a bit like well this isn't really I thought there'd be more choice I thought there'd be more like scope so I could do like journalism stuff and like travel writing and make I dunno I could probably do short stories but I just mm
A	yeah I did a travel writing module
B	that's really cool yeah
A	which I loved and I did really well in that erm I also did a science fiction and fantasy module
B	oh really?
A	I quite like sci-fi so
B	yeah
A	that was good and then obviously that into print scriptwriting and then I had to do novel writing twice er novel writing part one and then novel writing part two
B	oh blimey
A	effectively my dissertation was just trying to write a novel
B	did you write a novel?
A	er
A	yeah and I write I do like the first third of the book so I write like twenty thousand words thirty thousand words
B	that's crazy
A	forty thousand words
B	yeah
A	and then I I decide that what I'm gonna write next is too difficult that I
A	I can't possibly write it so I get bored of it and
B	I've started
A	no?
B	no
A	it's really difficult to write a book
B	I know but then I go back and I read it and I'm like that's rubbish
A	yeah
B	what was I thinking?
A	yeah it's embarrassing isn't it? I've gone back and read a few things and gone oh my god
B	yeah
A	not only that but my grammar was terrible
B	oh really?
A	this was the point actually because I don't remember them teaching me grammar at school and
B	no I don't think I was really taught
A	I went into this class and of course I hadn't been studying English for the last few years I'd been doing drama and not really going to school at all and the first class that I took in
A	terrible terrible
B	but what did you do?
A	I just er I just told him I said I'm sorry I
B	I don't know
A	yeah and he that same lecturer I had him the first year and I had him in the third year and he told me in the third year he said
B	oh that's really good
A	yeah cos I erm I ended up I got I didn't wanna sound like an idiot in class so I I took a couple of TEFL certificates to do my grammar
B	oh okay yeah
A	I started doing volunteer teaching with the students I started studying Japanese at the uni and like stuff like that so I just really focused on like improving my grammar so I kind of brought it back up
B	that's really good
A	and turns out we're now studying grammar as a masters
B	I know do you feel like cos you were so cos you've done so much creative writing that like
A	I'm a bit nervous I'm a bit nervous to be honest with you
B	cos I've done so much academic writing but you're like the complete opposite
A	yeah I'm quite worried to tell you honestly erm I think I've got the ideas and stuff but I
B	yeah
A	not sure if I've got the framework
B	I know so I know a lot of people as well like who I've kind of
A	yeah
B	quite often I can just pull stuff off cos I'm a bit like in exams
A	I might have to come to you then
A	when the as well
B	in exams if I'm like I haven't got a clue what that question means I'll just like kind of wing it
A	yeah
B	but I know other people who have such good ideas but just can't like convey them
A	construct it properly
B	yeah
A	I've been I've bought a couple of books on how to write essays recently so I'm just trying to read up on that and catch up
B	ah
A	yeah
B	cos it's different than how I used to do it so
A	well there's a document online
B	oh is there?
A	yeah they posted it erm
A	the MA English
B	oh okay I'll read that
A	and like
B	yeah they don't really mind
A	yeah
B	they say used to say that in
A	yeah
B	it doesn't really matter if you get it a bit wrong
A	cos I've seen them referencing here in a variety of ways so
B	yeah
A	I I'm just I'm doing Harvard standard
B	I haven't used Harvard before
A	no
B	I used to use what's the other one?
A	oh god I have looked at it briefly but
B	the other one where you do
A	yeah
B	and stuff and like ibid and like erm er really confusing
A	what's that? ibid?
B	yeah like
A	what does that mean?
B	you don't write the you like footnote and you write the book and then if you use a
A	right
B	I'm glad that we're
A	don't use that one did you have to then at
B	yeah that was their like their thing
A	funny how they make a convention don't they? why don't we just have one way of referencing?
B	I think you could I think you could use Harvard I know
A	what's the point in having a variety of ways?
B	who was like? er
A	yeah who cares?
A	you know what I mean? erm yeah they should just have a standard shouldn't they? everyone should just have a vote which one's best? that one right let's all do that one then
A	I believe so yeah do you know where the study room actually is?
B	mm training room
A	training room I'm sure
B	what are we doing? is he just gonna show us how to do stuff?
A	probably we're gonna have to go and get some books out and do something bollocks that I've already done probably
B	mm
A	so
B	I hate it when they're like when er what's her name?
A	yeah
B	I was like I know how to do this
A	I know how to get a book out
B	I've got a book out before
A	I've actually already read these books
B	very yeah she is really nice I've had her
A	oh you do as well? yeah she was good in that
B	yeah
A	I thought there was a good atmosphere in our class
B	I really like that class
B	yeah
A	it was quite conversational and stuff
B	definitely
A	and you're are you good friends with
B	not
A	yeah? I've got you on you're recorded saying it I'll play it back to her
B	I dunno yeah she is lovely very lovely
A	she's just moved hasn't she?
B	yeah I didn't even know that actually to be fair she's got erm well she kind of knows we met this girl called
A	okay
B	erm well I met this girl called
A	yes
B	and
A	yeah
B	got drunk and whatever
A	yeah you stayed for the
B	and then yeah and then we were like it was so good we were like let's go to the bar so me and
A	yeah
B	and stuff and
A	no
B	so I wanted to like carry on and erm
A	I bet you were drunk
A	I mean I saw you earlier in the afternoon that was quite a while before wasn't it? if you kept drinking
B	exactly erm yeah and
B	yeah no it's it's really fun it's
B	really? why?
A	erm well we were just sitting at home we were like we should've bloody gone to those fireworks yeah
B	you should've gone it was so good it was amazing
A	I bet there was good atmosphere
B	I love fireworks
A	yeah
B	as well but erm
A	so do we
A	to tell you honestly we have a pretty strict budget like
B	oh of course
A	we have X amount of money to last us the year
B	yeah
A	and if it runs out we're gonna get screwed so we'd already spent our money for the day and it was kinda like I can't really afford to stay out you know what I mean?
B	that's really good that you've done that though
A	we kinda have to like we saved up X amount of money to come here and if we end up spending too much then
A	then what? I can't finish my degree or something? so
A	kinda have to don't you? at that point
B	are you paying it in instalments? your
A	no it's gone the money's gone yeah
B	oh really? well that's good though that's a worry off your mind
A	I pay we paid it a few months before we came so yeah so we paid the rent in advance we paid that in advance
B	wow
A	and we've just got enough money for you know we've got enough
B	yeah
A	but not a lot like we could come to the bar maybe once a week and like do it's a bit lame but
A	and kind of get a cup and like pour it
B	that's really good
B	yeah
A	kind of have to be though to afford all the travelling that we've done we've had to we've basically lived on a budget for years now
B	yeah you get used to it don't you?
A	it's quite sad but I have an Excel spreadsheet that goes back for about four years
A	every day I've put in my budget
B	that's amazing
A	but it helps because although I say on that day we couldn't afford it erm some weeks we've not spent as much
B	yeah so you can
A	so then I know that we've got money to spend
B	and you can yeah
A	cos I've got an eye on what what we have spent and what we haven't spent so
B	do you either of you drive?
A	no neither of us can drive
B	oh okay then that's really?
A	yeah no
B	you just well I guess you both skipped out the country pretty soon
A	yeah I mean we left immediately after we graduated and then we considered I considered passing my test in Korea
A	erm it's a lot cheaper and a lot easier
B	mm
A	had our original intention recently when we went back we wanted to get a uni job for two years
B	yeah
A	when we returned and we got one but our friends who were really good friends before we were living with them in Tennessee at the time they said fuck it we'll come back with you and we couldn't find us all a uni job
B	oh
A	so we all went back through the system we were in before the public school but we said look if we do this then we have to get a uni job the next year which we did so when we got that uni job we kind of thought well a year's not really long enough at uni kinda so we're potentially gonna do a couple of years but then there were a lot of there was a lot of hoo-ha with maybe people were gonna get fired or laid off so
B	oh gosh
A	so as a backup plan we applied here and then we got in and once we started thinking about the actuality of doing it
B	you were like yeah
A	we got excited about it and were like screw it then let's go
A	you did?
B	and er I just did it
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and then I was like I might do a masters
A	do you feel like you've chosen the right course?
B	yeah I do I feel like it's gonna be really hard
A	yeah
B	I think it's gonna be pretty intense as well like this week as well I'm working like thirty-five hours
A	oh my god
B	so I was a bit like
B	I've told my manager that I don't wanna do more than twenty but er he just promoted me so I don't wanna be like hey
A	you've got to though
B	I know
A	otherwise you'll
B	I'll only do it this week
A	you don't want to get a third
B	I'll only do it this week and then I'll erm then I'll tell him but I think it's only this week because one of my managers is on holiday and also cos they wanna train me up so
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	this is kind of
A	your training week
B	but it's just gonna be a long week it doesn't matter I'll be fine
A	no that's fine last week for me was so long
B	yeah
B	we only met like a week ago
A	weird isn't it?
B	that's seems like so long ago that's crazy
A	yeah it does seem like a while ago doesn't it? you're very easy to talk to
B	ah do you think so?
A	yeah I think if I tried to record some other people I'd be just sitting here going I don't really know what to talk about
A	yeah what do you want? hot chocolate
A	is that your favourite?
B	er no I usually drink green tea I'm really good but sometimes I just wanna hot chocolate
A	do you get it from that place over there?
B	that was really nice that one I had from the arts building I dunno I don't know all the cafés and stuff have you been to many?
A	no I don't drink hot drinks at all oh er tell a lie occasionally I get do you know IBS?
B	yeah
A	yeah I get a little bit IBSy
B	mm
A	and I've been getting it recently cos I think I'm a bit anxious to tell you honestly
B	mm
A	and er maybe like changing diets coming back from Asia so I've been having peppermint tea of an evening
A	that's kind of been helping
B	I love like fresh mint tea as well
A	yeah
B	just get mint leaves and pour boiling water over it oh that's good
B	mm
A	well will they take card at these coffee shops?
A	no? I don't have any cash on me but to say thank you I'll totally grab you the
B	oh no don't be silly
A	no I will grab you the hot chocolate but
B	I I made sure I paid for the post office
B	so I had a bit of change
A	did you manage to download those books at all?
B	oh no I haven't tried
A	oh they've taken it off
B	so have they?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	er I gave you the website didn't I?
B	I know
A	so you can find them on that website
B	I I always do this like I have about a million things to do and I always forget and I write down multiple to do lists and then can't find them and
A	oh I'm sorry
B	yeah
A	I er
B	no thank you
A	I mean if you have a hard drive or anything if you leant it erm to me for a night I'd give it back to you the next day with everything on it
A	but so I can do it that way
B	what do I need? like a memory stick?
A	just something bigger than four cos I've got about four gigabytes of books so
B	I have a memory stick but I don't know how much how big it is
A	I mean unless it's ancient it'll probably be quite sizeable
B	yeah
A	so I mean tell a lie I've got a spare memory stick so I can put it on that for you give it to you
B	then I can
A	you could put it on your computer and then you could give it back to me yeah
B	yay can we do that?
A	yeah
B	oh that's awesome thank you
A	okay when do we well I'll see you tomorrow don't I?
B	yes
A	so
B	well don't feel you know if you're busy tonight don't feel
A	no I mean it only takes a few hours doesn't it? I'll just transfer it over it takes a while to transfer but I'll just leave it on
A	every day?
B	isn't that really annoying?
A	that sucks
B	I had two days off initially and now for some reason like my timetable's changed around a bit and now I'm in every day
A	oh no
B	and tomorrow we're in what? nine till twelve
A	yeah
B	then I have a four-hour
A	oh my gosh
B	and then I have one hour and then I'm in for an hour nine till ten on Wednesday and an hour nine till ten on Thursday I was like are you serious?
A	yeah
A	and Friday?
B	er four till six four till five or I think it's just four till five
A	that's an even worse I thought my schedule was bad but yours is even worse
B	well mine was really good and I was really pleased and now it's just awful
A	yeah
B	and
A	I was very tempted to do just the core modules
B	really?
A	I I was like if I do research in language and use
B	yeah
A	language description and analysis and language variation I'm only in Monday Tuesday
B	that'd be really good
A	you know what I mean? just
B	I was kind of like if I'd have known the timetable I probably would've taken like syntactic theory
A	yeah yeah
B	instead of forensic linguistics cos it would've like saved me two days of coming in
A	yeah
B	so but it's okay it's cos they have seminars on different days to lectures
A	yeah
B	which is good cos you get time to do the work but
A	to think about it and do that kind of stuff
B	and to yeah
A	but yeah I was erm I
B	mm
A	tomorrow from nine till twelve
A	Wednesday just from nine till ten same as you erm and then maybe with this roles thing we have to hang around until one which is like oh god
A	yeah and then I'm not in Thursday
B	oh that's nice
A	yeah which is nice and then Friday I'm just in for one hour as well twelve till one so
B	yeah
A	it's a lot on the trains
B	it is
A	that's why I've got this this Unizone thing yeah
B	that's why I did it and I thought it's good as well cos I er work in
A	yeah
B	I might go into
A	yeah good idea
B	I need to get some stuff so
A	bloody hell five days though
B	mm
A	maybe next semester make sure you go for the er
A	we haven't chosen our ones for next semester
B	no I was I was thinking that
A	yeah
B	I'm really confused
A	cos all my undergraduates in my classes they've planned out they know what they're doing
B	no I'm pretty sure there's like a
A	yeah
B	like language and mind or something
A	yeah and well they change them as well don't they?
B	mm
A	they've definitely I think they've got it in the new module handbook they've definitely got phrenology definitely got first language acquisition
B	phrenology would
A	I wouldn't mind doing that but I reckon it'll be quite difficult
B	mm
A	cos it's goes pretty deep phrenology so but I'd quite like to do that I'd like to do world Englishes that'd be quite interesting erm
B	that'd be really good
A	no I guess we don't choose them yet but I'm tempted next semester to go for an easier schedule especially cos this semester
B	yeah you
A	and they're living with us for three weeks
A	and it's right bang in the middle of the course
B	and it's like both of you have got so much to do
A	yeah so we're a little bit worried erm
B	yeah
A	so then they they should just kind of get on a little bit
B	entertain themselves
A	we're going to Amsterdam with them for a few days
B	are you?
A	because
B	that's so cool
A	pop to Amsterdam they've always wanted to go there
B	have you been?
A	oh yeah I've been like five times
B	really?
A	yeah
B	do you love it?
A	no no I wouldn't say I love it but I guess as a as a younger man
A	it erm appealed to me quite a bit and it's close so erm I popped over there a few
B	I'd love to go
A	I er
B	I haven't done much of Europe so
A	have you never been to Amsterdam?
B	no
A	oh where have you been?
B	erm I've done like Spain like seven or eight times
A	yeah
B	erm Greece
A	Spain mainland? or like are you talking like Majorca? Menorca?
B	I've done like Tenerife
A	yeah
B	and Spain
A	I've been to Gran Canaria
B	like
A	mm
B	erm
A	where did you go?
B	a few times Crete and
A	Santorini?
B	oh no I wanna go to Santorini though
A	it's really pretty
B	oh
B	that's like one of my places
B	and I wanna go Greek island hopping
A	yes
B	did you?
A	we we did an eastern Europe trip in in between year two and year three
B	yeah
A	in our degree and we camped pretty much the whole thing so we did like Greece Turkey Bulgaria Romania
B	that's so good
A	Hungary and
B	did you get like a? did you interrail? or did you?
A	no no we just paid for things as they came or bussed or did whatever
B	oh
A	erm I don't like interrailing
B	no?
A	and I don't like these round the world flight tickets either because I feel like people are very very limited to staying in the big cities
B	yeah
A	they don't get out of it
B	I thought interrailing I didn't realise are you scheduled trains? I thought you could just go on whatever you wanted?
A	erm I guess I didn't look into it enough
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A does enjoy interrailing.	Contradiction
A	but I'm pretty sure from the people we met that they
A	it was limited to certain places and like you could it was basically between the capital cities you could go from you know this capital to that capital
B	yeah
A	to that capital
A	and anything else in between you had to pay for and
B	no
A	but Greece was nice we spent about we were only there for about two weeks but we went island hopping and
A	took a twenty-five hour boat journey up to er the north of Greece
[ANNOTATION]	They visited Mykonos and Santorini, while in Greece.	Neutral
B	wow
A	which is actually horrible
B	really?
A	yeah cos you get on the ferry at like four in the morning
B	yeah
A	so you're already completely knackered and there's nowhere to sleep so you're just kind of lying out on the deck like trying to sleep
B	oh my god I bet you got off and you were like seized up
A	yeah no
B	mm
A	and I spent the whole time like trying to sneak
A	and he went off to go find people
B	oh my god
A	so like we like got out and disappeared and like
[ANNOTATION]	They got on the ferry at 4 in the morning.	Entailment
B	ran out
A	had to basically not get any sleep for two days
B	that's so funny
A	which is terrible
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A didn't sleep for two days.	Entailment
B	I'm quite I like erm I went to Egypt and stuff I like stuff like that
A	yeah
B	I wanna go to Morocco
A	oh that's cool my friend's just come back from Morocco
B	really?
A	went to Marrakesh he just got married so er
B	yeah
A	that's his honeymoon mm
B	oh wow that's so nice
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B wants to visit Instabul.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	did you go to his wedding?
A	no I wasn't invited
A	no but erm
B	not a best friend then
A	I said er no he is a good friend actually but erm I mean obviously I've been living out of the country for a while so we're not as tight as we could be but he erm he didn't invite any friends actually by the looks of things it was just family yeah
B	oh was it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A wasn't invited because of bad relationships.	Neutral
A	yeah it was quite a small affair he I sat down with him I went through the photos with his with his wife now and er she's Indian of Indian descent
B	oh nice
A	erm and I didn't see anyone there were no friends
B	yeah
A	it was all just like family
B	yeah
A	so I didn't feel bad
B	mm
A	so I saw him yesterday so it was like really rushed
B	oh nice that's cool
A	so
A	yeah I
B	oh gosh
A	so you have to change and get on a bus and do all this kind of stuff so it was ah
B	that's oh I hate that rail replacement thing literally takes so long
A	yeah it's horrible isn't it?
B	yeah
A	so I and I so I didn't get back until about eight o'clock last night so I just I felt like er the
B	yeah
A	and now it's I'm in on a long assed day today it's just busy isn't it? but that's a masters isn't it?
A	so what are you gonna do after
B	well my plan was to do what you guys did but now I have two plans and I also would really like to be like cos I think it's cos I was promoted I'm kind of thinking mm I'd like to be like an area manager
A	okay
B	for which is completely not related to this
A	mm
B	erm but then I also wanna
A	oh that's cool
B	Thailand and maybe like China erm
A	Thailand's easy you'll get a job there no worries
B	yeah
A	Middle East you'll probably need a little bit of experience first yeah
B	really? okay so Thailand would be better to go to first
A	you could get a job in Korea no worries if it interests you in any way
B	yeah
A	you just need to get a little TEFL certificate
B	yeah I know I was gonna do that after I finish this
A	yeah
B	I wanted to do it I went to careers and I was like
A	yeah
B	and I was like okay I won't then cos I also have a job and stuff
A	although they're so easy
A	like the basic TEFL certificates are almost not worth the paper they're written on
B	what do you need though? cos there's about a million different courses
A	yeah I would personally I mean I've got three certificates
B	oh wow
A	I have a CELTA which is from Cambridge University I then have a basic so that was like a five-week observed every day eight hours a day course
B	oh that's good yeah
A	but the first one I did was a twenty-hour weekend course
B	yeah
A	as like an introductory TEFL course I then liked that so I took a distance course and that was a hundred hours and that was basically read this book and take two exams and do it all distance
B	oh that's good yeah
A	that certificate was enough for me to get a pay rise when I went out to Korea at the time when I went out to Korea you didn't need any TEFL stuff cos now you do
B	oh really?
A	you have to have that basic one
B	yeah
A	you need to have a hundred-hour certificate I would personally say if you can afford it and you have the time skip all the crappy TEFL certificates go straight for a CELTA
B	and just do a big one yeah
A	erm it's a well recognised and quite difficult certificate erm it's gonna cost about a thousand to fifteen hundred pounds though
B	really?
A	yeah and it takes four to five weeks
A	it was amazing so like all of our students were like surfer stoner Ecuadorian people that were like
B	that's so funny
A	making surfboards and stuff so really cool
B	no I feel like yeah so well I do er cos I know it's gonna cost like doing a TEFL's gonna cost a bit er I will when I finish this I will just work in the shop for a little while
A	mm
B	see how far I can get up cos I've only been there for three months and I've been promoted twice
A	yeah that's amazing
B	so I'm thinking
A	they obviously like you the face of
B	yeah erm but I yeah so I'm like basically like oh I might be the manager by next week so
A	yeah
A	yeah well maybe go for it how are you funding this then?
A	oh very nice
B	he's paying
A	can he fund me too?
A	oh okay that's fair
B	yeah so erm
A	but that's just tuition fees so what about everything else?
B	well cos I don't really cos I just work so it's
A	so there's you're not paying rent cos you're living with your mum
B	no I pay her like
A	what's that? what's the point in that?
B	like
A	is that just for a bath?
B	as a gesture
A	yeah
B	I think basically I don't each much food so that kind of just covers my food
A	no you're quite small aren't you? so
B	erm
A	no
B	so that's it
A	so everything you earn is for you to drink
B	is well I owe
B	I owe my dad a bit of money not for this but for like for other stuff
A	yeah
B	erm but yeah erm
A	nice of him to give you a couple of grand though
B	I know
B	especially when I owe him
A	and your grandad as well did you say?
B	yeah but I have to pay my grandad back I don't have to pay my dad back
A	oh okay so it's a loan but it's a loan without interest
B	mm
A	from the bank
B	exactly
A	and that kind of thing yeah
B	I was gonna get a bank loan that's what I was gonna do cos Barclays do like a nobody does any funding but Barclays do like a postgrad loan
A	mm
B	where you can it's like ten grand and then you get a year like interest free and then you have to start paying interest on it
A	and you know the interest's quite a bit higher
B	and exactly and I was talking to my dad about it and he was like
A	no
B	he was like it's not worth getting a bank loan and getting in loads of debt for it so
A	no do you have student loans?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	how much do you have out of interest?
B	erm I think I owe
A	cos you were with the top-up fees were you not?
B	no I wasn't I
A	so you were no
B	I only paid three grand
A	yeah that's what I would call top-up fees
B	oh sorry yeah no
A	cos when I went it was twelve hundred a year
B	really?
A	yeah and then the year after I went they they brought what they call top-up fees
B	oh I see
A	and that went to three grand
B	oh the year after me it went to nine grand
A	and then it went to nine
B	yeah
A	it's crazy
B	I know
A	and my brother's just signed up so what? do you have like twenty grand in debt? or something like that yeah?
B	yeah like twenty-five
A	twenty-five I've got fifteen I haven't paid a penny off since I've been
B	really?
A	I mean we've had to pay them but they have
B	when you're working abroad do you have to pay?
A	yeah you do it's a bit of a pain in the arse cos it's not automatic so you have to contact them all the time and every month I have to sign in and pay and all this stupid stuff but they have you know they have like a threshold
B	mm
A	and if you earn over this then you start paying
B	yeah yeah
A	that threshold changes depending on the country you're in
B	oh okay
A	so in England I think it's like eighteen grand or something like that yeah
B	yeah
A	but in Korea it was like twelve grand
A	and we were on about fourteen grand I wasn't on that much money so
B	so if you were earning that in England you wouldn't've had to pay it
A	no yeah so in Korea we didn't have to pay much though I was only paying about thirty pound a month or something
B	yeah
A	it was basically just covering the interest so I've been paying off the interest and it's still exactly what it was six years ago
B	but after twenty-five years they just write it off
A	yours mine they don't
B	oh
A	mine gets written off when I'm sixty-five
B	okay
A	so for me that's forty-five years so you got although you had to borrow more you'll probably not end up I'll probably end up paying more than you do
B	yeah
B	that's amazing
A	to pay for this it was difficult though because on the one hand when we were like just about to pay our tuition fees we were like I could do an MA for a year
B	yeah
A	or I could travel Africa for an entire year
B	I literally I was like
B	not like I er
A	yeah
B	I was like mm
A	is that what you want then?
B	I wanted to like but I was like cos I just think how am I ever gonna get on the property ladder?
A	oh
A	not gonna happen
B	I don't think I ever will I'm just like it's getting impossible especially if you're single like at least there's two of you
A	and academic
B	like for me
A	have you not got a boyfriend
B	no no
A	no?
A	who was your last boyfriend? or girlfriend?
B	erm
A	which way do you swing? sorry
B	boys
A	we are in
B	erm my last boyfriend was a boy called
A	yeah?
B	yeah
A	same age?
B	er yeah he was
A	or was he one of these older with a car?
B	no he was a year older
B	he did have a car
A	yeah
B	which was nice
A	cool
B	erm but he went to uni with me in
A	ah as they always do
B	my last year was like awful and we both said like our last year of uni
A	oh okay
B	cos it was so bad
A	that's terrible
B	like every time we went out it was like me like crying and screaming
A	yeah
B	either leave each other alone or get back together like it was really bad
A	yeah
B	but now we're now we're okay I think
A	yeah?
B	we're on on good terms
A	so you're amicable again yeah?
B	yeah
A	that's good how long were you together then?
B	only like we were together for like a year but then before that we did all that like oh no strings
B	and it was really complicated
B	erm so we were kind of together then but it was yeah he was like oh yeah no I don't want a relationship but then he'd we'd like go out for dinner and then we like went to er you know we'd like go to
A	so kind of treating you like a girlfriend but didn't want a girlfriend
B	yeah I was kind of like okay you're kind of giving me a few mixed signals here buddy
A	I was kind of like that with
B	really?
A	yeah because I think cos my parents had divorced and I'd been with a girl from sixteen to like seventeen and a half like a year and a half
B	yeah
A	and I really liked her and my parents divorced and she basically didn't want the baggage so she like dumped me and ended up going with one of my best friends at the time
B	oh god
A	and I was pretty heartbroken at the time
B	yeah that's grim
A	and I got to uni and was just very blunt and honest and said I don't wanna be in a relationship you know what I mean? so
B	really?
A	we were in the same halls er we were in the same room in the same flat
B	ah wow
A	erm we didn't do anything for the first six months then we kind of got together but kinda had an on and off relationship for er maybe two years like kind of we were together I never did anything else with anyone else once we I
B	yeah
A	I didn't I was loyal but I'd always was saying to her that you know
B	you didn't wanna
A	after uni I'm gonna go to Japan or I'm gonna do
B	mm
A	if you know what I mean and I look back and think that was a bit of a twattish thing to do but I just didn't wanna be tied down at the time
B	yeah
A	but the more I travelled with her the more we
A	er well I proposed recently erm while we were in Cambodia
B	oh nice oh my god
A	that was about three months ago
B	that's amazing
A	mm
B	I didn't know that
A	so in front of a temple
B	and she said yes I presume?
A	but we may never actually get married
B	really?
A	erm because we wanna go and work in the Middle East we have to be married to even be anywhere near each other
B	mm
A	so we have for a while have
B	yeah you'd just
A	and I was sitting there thinking that's not very romantic is it? if she we just go and sign a piece of paper so I thought I should propose to her but she's only got it's a wooden ring it's not a metal ring or anything
B	was she expecting it?
A	no she wasn't I thought she might be but she was very surprised so
A	in our eyes when I proposed and said will you marry me? and she said yes
B	yeah
A	we are married
A	and the rest is just a you know a formality
B	yeah
A	kind of thing did you wanna go and get a coffee or something?
A	erm let's have a look
B	what time's our thingy?
A	oh fifty-five so we've got five more minutes and then we've done an hour
B	how long do we need to
A	and it's three twenty-five so
B	oh awesome
A	we have thirty-five minutes until class
A	can you do five more minutes?
B	yeah it's fine erm
A	again thank you very very much
B	that's okay so you're so you're not interested in like the wedding
A	erm I guess a part of us thinks
B	bet your mum would want that
A	oh yeah she pushes for it quite a bit same as children
A	a part of us thinks you know down the line it would be nice to have a big party with our friends that kind of stuff
B	yeah
A	but there's no way we can afford it for years erm
B	mm they're so expensive
A	so yeah
A	well won't get anyone to come will I?
B	mm
A	all my family and then I think about the practicalities I mean I haven't seen my mum or my dad in the same room for ten years so
B	mm
A	my dad would beat the crap out of her husband I'm pretty sure so
B	oh is it still a bit like?
A	I mean you know
B	is you dad with anyone else?
A	yeah yeah he is but she's erm she's been dying for like the last few years which
A	she went blind recently last year completely blind
B	that is awful
A	she's got the
A	and she was the old best friend of my mother
B	oh
A	yeah it's all very complex my dad grew up in a children's home
A	his his mother committed suicide to get away from his dad and his dad put him in a children's home actually
B	really?
A	and then my mum worked at the children's home and so did her best friend and that's so my dad was with his mum and then a couple of years after they broke up he got back in contact with her friend and now they're together so it's all been very and my mother's now back with her childhood sweetheart that she was with from sixteen so
B	oh so your mum and dad aren't on good terms? or?
A	not really no erm they can talk to each other through me but they don't talk to each other directly about anything so
B	yeah oh dear
A	and that's ten years later so it's a bit rubbish isn't it?
B	makes you think doesn't it?
A	just every time I come home there's some crap you know what I mean?
B	yeah
B	have you got brothers and sisters?
A	erm I have originally I had one brother my you know blood brother but more recently I now have two step-sisters and two step-brothers
B	yeah oh wow
A	and I have a half-brother who's five
B	oh my gosh do you really?
B	wow
A	so I just saw him at the weekend so he's a little five-year-old boy
B	is he really cute?
A	yeah I mean he er I find children a little bit annoying so he's
A	he's a bit of both I can handle him for a couple of hours but like after
B	he's your brother
A	I'm good with children I am but
B	yeah well you you're a teacher so I'd hope so
A	yeah but it's a bit of an act like inside I'm actually going where's the adult conversation here? you know what I mean?
B	mm
B	why can't you speak?
A	I know yeah
B	oh good
A	I'd read that five-year-olds can't understand passive constructions
B	mm
A	so like the sentence the zebra
B	oh
A	they can't understand because the
B	they don't get the thing
A	syntactically the structure is saying the zebra kissed the monkey the zebra was kissed by the monkey
B	that's really interesting I'm quite interested in erm my dissertation was on like Peter Pan and erm this thing called text world theory so if you like when you read a text the kind of constructions that your mind makes
A	yeah okay
B	sort of like connotations and stuff
A	yeah yeah
B	but a bit deeper than that erm so like the things that you associate and stuff and how children can't make those associations
A	mm
B	cos they're not yeah so that was like that was my whole thing and I was really interested in that and I was like this is what I'm gonna do for my masters
A	yeah
B	I can really expand on this and now I'm like I don't know whether I'd really be allowed to do it cos
A	well look next semester we have a module in first language acquisition which is a core module
B	well yeah we have like quite a we have a couple of modules which are relevant but I'm thinking a lot of it is a lot like erm oh I think Malaysian English they might prefer me to go down that road rather than go down my other road but
A	yeah yeah rather than the well it's up to you it's your degree
B	I know
A	you do what you want
B	I'll talk to someone about it nearer the time but
A	have you dyed your hair
B	no why? does it look different?
A	is that natural then?
B	oh yeah no this is what happened I used to be blonde and erm like obviously this is my natural colour
A	yeah
B	I used to be blonde and then erm then I dyed it brunette again cos erm basically my ex-boyfriend was a hairdresser so like I used to like it was really good yeah he wasn't gay
A	no okay well in all fairness
A	it is a stereotype and I had my hair cut recently and the guy was such a bloke
A	like
B	no he was erm yeah so he was a hairdresser so he used to do it all the time for free obviously and it costs a lot of money to get your hair done I don't know if you know and erm then we split up so I couldn't afford to do it any more so I dyed it back dark and then it all just grew out but then this amazing ombre dip dye trend came in
A	yeah
B	so now my hair's really in trend cos it's like dip dye
A	yeah it looks good
B	I know
A	I like it mm
B	thank you so I was pretty I was pretty like oh I timed that
A	I used to have long hair
B	did you? how long was it?
B	are you serious?
A	I've had long hair four times I usually I'm a bit schizophrenic I have work
B	that's amazing
A	the last time I
B	have you ever tried to make it into dreadlocks?
A	it just gets really tiring to like comb no I considered it but I thought it was a bit cliché and so I never did
B	yeah
A	I I prefer the the kind of Asian bun do you know what I mean?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	where you just kinda get it and you just tuck it back in that's how I normally used to wear my hair but it got too long so
B	oh that's really cool
A	I mean if you check my Facebook if you go back through a few photos you'll see
B	oh I'll do a little Facebook stalk
A	big old beard as well
B	what's going on in there
A	shall we walk around then?
B	yeah sure
B	er
A	are you getting are you getting something to drink? or? I need the toilet before class anyway
B	well I'll just we're in the
A	I don't know
B	there's a café
A	I've gotta meet
B	yeah
A	in about fifteen minutes
B	no it's fine
A	erm yeah do they have toilets in the
B	oh were they?
A	cos the birds just all sit in one place don't they?
A	like here in this corner
B	it's like a public toilets
A	lovely I wouldn't eat my food of that
B	so you record like dinner parties and stuff
A	anything I can that's just British people
B	if you recorded a dinner party of me and my friends literally you'd get like the worst
A	would it be a bit crude?
B	we're so bad
B	like we just talk about bullshit like all of the time
A	that's alright though isn't it?
A	as long as it's not incriminating
B	no
A	then it should be alright
B	would you get in trouble for that?
A	er you might if you did it
A	I've got a friend I told you
B	oh dear
A	it'd be about you know drugs or
B	oh god
A	crimes he's committed or whatever and er cos he's been arrested a few times so
B	why does he feel like that's an appropriate time to tell you about
A	well he just gets excited he hasn't seen me in a while so
A	we start reminiscing and talking about
B	I got arrested
A	cos I mean I have a bit of a history myself so
B	do you really?
A	yeah I won't go into it on recording but
B	mm of course
A	so erm
B	I've never been arrested so
A	have you not?
B	that's good
A	yeah neither have I never
A	erm no I told you I went a bit off the rails and that when I was younger and my parents divorced I kind of went a bit
B	crazy
A	not crazy just I didn't care do you know what I mean?
B	mm
A	I just didn't care what happened to me and what I did
B	I was only eight when mine divorced and I don't remember it being a horrible time at all
A	no?
B	no it was like I wasn't even bothered literally and my mum was like I'm gonna leave your dad and I was like oh cool
B	that's cool so what's for dinner?
A	yeah
A	and they stayed amicable and stuff?
B	yeah they were alright they had the usual like you owe me more money sort of thing but
A	did your dad have to pay CSA or whatever it was?
B	yeah like maintenance and stuff
A	that kind of stuff yeah my dad had to do that as well
B	but erm yeah no they're fine
A	but did they divorce just because you know they'd come to the end of their tether? or was someone cheating on someone? or?
B	I don't really know I think so I reckon my dad might I think my step-mum might've been on the scene a little beforehand
A	ah okay
B	but I don't know the details I've never really asked I'd never be like
A	there's no way of telling because I mean my my family gave me the impression it was my dad that was cheating cos like
B	really?
A	he started sleeping on the couch and like they were arguing all the time
B	yeah oh god
A	and in my head and they wouldn't tell us what was going on I was thinking my dad was doing something but it was my mum
B	really?
A	yeah my mum had been cheating on him for a couple of years
B	but he was sleeping on the sofa?
A	so yeah he was erm she kicked him out of the room and like all of this kind of stuff and like
A	for grounds for divorce she had to basically convince my family that my dad was an alcoholic when he wasn't at all so my dad has no contact with the rest of my family now which is kind of sad
B	yeah
A	so
B	oh dear
A	and it's sad because he never had his own parents so he kind of just lost
B	well yeah and now his new partner is dying
A	is dying as well he's
B	he's not done too well with that
A	no he's not well I mean out of him and his mates out of about ten people that he was friends with at the home seven of them have committed suicide and only three of them are alive so
B	oh my god
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A mother is not loyal wife.	Entailment
A	it's quite bad statistics
B	sometimes when you think you have problems and you hear about stuff like that and then I'm like I don't really have
A	yeah I'm the first person to even go to university in my family so
B	oh that's so good though
B	mm
A	my bunch unfortunately
A	yeah I guess so er she's that's what she said
B	yeah no that's fine
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has an older brother at the university.	Contradiction
A	if if not you know often that's fine but just any point over the next
B	we could make it into a study session at the same time
A	we could do yeah
B	what do you think?
A	it's possible as well that I might swap with
B	yeah of course
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't think a study session is possible.	Contradiction
A	cos we're both doing this
B	and I might get a bit bored of you so
A	yeah no of course I'm already bored of you you tire you tire me that's good it's weird going back and listening to these things as well cos I have to analyse it afterwards
B	oh oh no that's horrible really?
A	yeah but not in detail
B	do you do you mind listening to yourself?
A	erm at first I hated it
B	yeah I can't stand
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has heard his/her recorded voice many times.	Neutral
A	I sounded like a frog I've got a really horrible voice and then erm
B	I sound like a child I'm so squeaky
A	no you're not
A	you are quite small you're not expected to have a bellowing you know
A	baritone
B	okay can we stop?
A	ah
B	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is not really happy with his/her recorded voice.	Entailment
A	she's here she seems to have some new clothes or at least I don't remember seeing them oh there's
[ANNOTATION]	Someone speaker A saw doesn't wear old garments.	Entailment
