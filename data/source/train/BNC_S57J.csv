A	yeah so er I did some photography modelling for my friend
B	right
A	he was taking it on film so he's no idea how any of them have turned out
B	oh okay
A	is it yeah
B	so was he doing it black and white or colour?
A	yeah black and white
B	right
A	so it was I I didn't can you do colour in darkroom?
B	of course you can yeah
A	oh I didn't know that but yeah I think it must be easier to do
B	right
A	black and white
B	right
A	he's never actually done darkroom stuff before so he's like well hopefully I won't mess it up
A	yeah
B	oh yeah it's quite a process wasn't there when you were that was quite appealing for you? darkroom photography?
A	I mean it er seems quite cool to me but
B	yeah
A	we had at college at college at school we had erm this light sensitive er like I want to say paper but it's not paper it's like flimsy plasticy stuff
B	okay yeah
A	and so you could like create stuff that looked kind of dark roomy
B	right
A	by like putting all these objects on it and then
B	yeah
A	you'd just expose it to light and then you could like wash that and it makes them develop it and then it would just be like the silhouettes of these things
B	mm
A	and by layering different things you could create different like depth of light and shade on it
B	yeah oh I don't
A	which was quite cool
B	remember seeing any of those
A	well no because I couldn't do it like as a proper project
B	right
A	because we didn't actually have the the liquid stuff to develop it in
B	the chemicals right
A	to to like
B	yeah
A	so it would it would all just change colour completely
B	right
A	I used it in my book as like backing stuff though which was lot a lot of people
B	oh okay
A	used it for
B	yeah yeah
A	it was that was the only thing really
B	so how many were were you of were were there of you as it were
A	er
B	doing the modelling?
A	there oh I don't know cos they weren't all there when I was there but er
B	was he just doing portrait photography?
A	yeah he was doing erm he wanted to do like his project's on fear
B	right
A	so he was
B	oh okay
A	so like one girl
B	yeah
A	but erm her fear was clowns so they got
B	but you did tell her beforehand
A	yeah yeah
B	he was gonna do that right
A	and she was like I
B	right
A	and so
B	right
A	she she said it she said it was terrifying but
B	really?
A	she did it anyway
B	oh dear
A	so yeah
A	yeah
B	so and what was your fear?
A	er I just like oh there's plenty but I just went with failure
A	so erm so it was quite funny actually but er because I turned up and he he'd wanted to do erm like
B	oh okay
A	cos that's not really the kind of failure I was thinking of but whatever anyway that was what he was gonna do cos it was easier for him but he found out with someone else can't really project cos the lighting just doesn't work
B	oh okay
A	in this scenario so erm I'd just got my
B	yeah
A	er which was my mock which you know I
B	oh okay
A	so erm
A	cos obviously it's got like the actual cover then
B	yeah
A	and so he just wrote failure across it and did an F
A	I said he could he was like are you sure? I was like yeah go for it I mean it's just gonna sit in my in my file
A	I'm only gonna be
B	right
A	the only one seeing it
B	yeah
A	so yeah and then I was I was I was saying to him yeah I'm gonna have to my parents are gonna see that I'm gonna have to explain explain it to them
A	exam paper? it was for art
A	so
B	you suffer for your art
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	so he did that so erm I want to see them
B	and what was the actual grade? an A grade?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so so he'd he'd written failure across it first of all and then somebody else in the room went it's quite funny cos there's just an A below that so he
A	he was like can I change it to an F? and I was like yeah go for it
B	defacing an exam paper I don't know
A	yeah
A	it's quite funny
B	so what
A	he
B	right
A	and then yeah he didn't really I just sort of looked quite serious and miserable but
A	and he just took the photo
B	yeah
A	it was cool
B	oh there weren't any snakes slithering about were there?
A	no but
A	they'd found erm his dad words in a charity shop
B	yeah
A	and and he'd found him this erm
B	right
A	and so they just had a dead
B	preserved?
A	a like a yeah a big dead spider cos somebody's fear was spiders
B	oh my goodness
A	yeah so that was interesting
B	and I'm guessing that that person wasn't prepared to hold it in their hand
A	no I think
B	was it dangling above her or something?
A	I think she erm she said no I can't do it in the end cos she was just too freaked out
B	freaked
A	out too freaked out by it yeah
B	oh
A	yeah
B	bit of Photoshop oh no you can't Photoshop cos it would be a darkroom photography
A	no so
B	right right
A	but yeah yeah
B	mm
A	he was asking
A	and he was like so he's like right so
B	if somebody is coming down a dark alley at night
A	yeah
B	on a motorbike
A	on a motorbike and shoots me
B	that he should be pretty safe in the UK
B	it's more of an Italian sort of thing isn't it?
B	you know
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah right
B	ah right so yeah
A	so I'm looking forward to seeing the photos anyway yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	especially the clown ones cos apparently it looked amazing so
B	really?
A	yeah
B	who was it that dressed up?
A	it was
B	oh it was
A	yeah
B	right
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	did he carry on wearing the stage makeup
A	I don't know
B	for the rest of the day?
A	I didn't see him so I don't know
A	but erm yeah the they had some good make up stuff going on there they they were like they
B	oh yeah?
A	and then erm like it was just his friends were doing it and then they did
B	yeah
A	I dunno what it was but she'd done some like really intricate erm like it was almost it looked it was she'd done it with eyeliner but it looked almost like a weird sort of constricting tape
B	oh right?
A	going across the leg
B	yeah
A	with like these lines and this criss-crossing but I dunno what it was meant to be but it looked really good
B	yeah
A	so
B	mm well I I was getting a bit arsy today I had more stickers to put up around the
A	oh right
B	yeah but the only thing was you know I needed to get those rockets up high and cos I'm not that tall I was literally jumping up
B	and just sort of like tapping it to kind of just like get it to stick to the wall
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah I was considering getting
A	yeah
B	to you know
A	to stick some stickers on the wall
B	yeah but I I I kind of managed it on my own in the end so
A	mm
B	I was quite pleased with my robot and rockets wall it looks quite funky
A	oh
B	yeah
A	good well this was the first time that I'd ever been down to the photography department
B	oh was it?
A	because it's just like the whole art section it's just nobody ends up there unless you're an art student because it's right at like the far end of the building
B	yeah
A	you just don't need to go anywhere near it and you barely even you know see it
B	right
A	from any
B	oh right really tucked away
A	you never you never end up there unless you
B	no
A	actually have to or you get really lost
B	yeah
B	ah
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	well yeah that was interesting
B	mm
A	to see that part of the building
B	yeah
A	could easily go two years there and never go down there you know
B	really?
A	yeah
B	yeah have you do you use the theatre much? the
A	yeah
B	is that all
A	all our lessons are in there
B	oh so that is where your lessons are
A	yeah
B	oh
A	all ours is except the erm except the Wednesday one which is the college play enrichment that we all have to go to cos it's just more time erm
B	oh right
A	but er that's in the there's like a drama studio upstairs
B	oh okay
A	which is quite big and has curtains and things
B	yeah yeah
A	but erm yeah and then the rest of the building is like catering and hairdressing and some classrooms
B	right but that's that that's the
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	so oh
A	oh and the music department's in there
B	right
A	so
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	quite cool isn't it you know when you're older and you sort of you know well I used to rehearse in the
A	I guess yeah yeah it has a name to it
B	mm
A	you know

A	no
B	no
A	he yeah he was good he is funny
B	that was a French guy wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	a lot of people don't tend to have support acts
B	no it's quite unusual for a comedian
A	yeah
B	to have a support act it's very unusual
A	yeah
B	actually
A	and again
B	and again yeah
A	every time
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but maybe wait for his next tour you know rather than
A	yes
B	I think cos he's doing that tour isn't he at at White Rock

A	yes indeed
B	or yeah yeah
B	mm
A	yes but yeah he's he's great and Dara O'Briain would be good to see

A	the other one yeah
B	we've got two I found the other
A	Craic Dealer
B	Craic Dealer I found that funnier
A	yeah
B	than this one erm
A	yeah
B	yeah but er
A	sorry for my failure of a birthday present then
B	no it wasn't at all I mean I still enjoyed it
A	I I'm kidding
B	I was still laughing
A	I'm kidding yeah
B	but you know
A	yeah no there were some bits in there I was like mm
B	yeah he's just
A	he always
B	the master at that isn't he?
A	yeah he's it's quite yeah it's quite good you know he's doing it
B	yeah yeah cos he always manages to bring it back full circle as well
A	yeah
B	you know kind of in terms
A	yeah
B	of his
A	yes mm
B	and he er yeah he'll
B	refer to something right at the very beginning won't he you know
A	yeah and then it'll come back again
A	do you remember?
B	yeah yeah
A	we we were all oh it's I've got it written down somewhere like how it started
B	really?
A	but I just remember then we were all just like stuck on a on a plane from the Netherlands and we'd just been forced to watch it and
A	we were never gonna leave
A	and then and then what's your name? Hans
B	that's it yeah
B	they really got into yeah
A	yeah
B	and that guy's partner as well didn't she have to sing or something? in a
A	oh somebody did
B	yeah
A	I didn't think it was his partner
B	I thought it was the woman who sat to him I thought
A	oh
B	she was with him but yeah yeah
A	right yeah
B	but I I thought the erm just it was just quite fun you know when we had to do the er the Dr Who theme tune
A	yeah
B	and
A	oh we didn't get to do that though but
B	well we
A	it was them down below us were doing it
B	no we all had a part didn't we?
A	no
B	I think we all had a part
A	I don't oh maybe we did
B	he divided up the back the front erm
A	no I I thought it was two
B	no we we did we did
A	I'm not convinced
B	oh okay we'll take a
A	but I'm not I'm not I'm not sure in myself either
B	yeah we did he got us all involved at the back he split us into four sections
A	okay
B	er anyway yeah we'll have to watch it back on erm you know when his DVD comes out
A	yeah well
B	he
A	but it might be different then
B	oh
A	because it'll be a different structure
B	er
A	but yeah the Dr Who laughing was funny yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	ha-ha-ha-ha yeah yeah that was yeah that was a good good moment
B	just trying to think what musical erm instruments
A	he didn't use as many
B	no
A	he did the the the death metal any song
B	yeah which was funny cos he
A	yeah
B	he did Barbie Girl didn't he?
A	yeah didn't he do Doe a Deer?
B	yeah
B	yes yeah
A	quite funny oh he did the the bouillon spoon song
B	oh yeah yeah that was good
A	yeah he was using a lot of piano
B	mm
A	which he actually does
B	shame he didn't like the
A	he did have one funny instrument like a little
B	oudy type thing
A	yeah but it wasn't an oud but it was
B	mm
A	it was like a viola or something
B	yeah
A	yeah cos he I remember people trying to guess what it was
B	that's right that yeah and there was erm no he
A	no he had less musical instruments
B	onstage stuff yeah
A	yeah definitely
B	in fact less visuals as well wasn't there?
A	well he didn't have any visuals did he?
B	thought he
A	well barely any
B	barely any yeah
A	which was a shame cos I quite liked those last time
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah cos he did erm the last one he did that conveyor belt sort of
A	yeah
B	not conveyor belt checkout
A	yeah
B	er
A	was that the last one or was it the one
B	must have been the one before
A	or the one that you went to
B	oh maybe it was probably the one before
A	yeah the one that yeah
B	cos we didn't go to the last one and you went to the last one
A	yeah I think I have seen it though on like
B	right
A	on a video
B	a DVD
A	but yeah
B	yeah
A	on DVD
B	mm

A	oh
B	er had a a you know
A	isn't er Gary Oldman as well?
B	Gary Oldman? no I think he's a is he an actor or a I think he might have been an actor there's a Mike Oldfield who's a musician
A	field
A	an old field
[ANNOTATION]	Gary Oldman is a chef.	Contradiction
B	an old field
A	yeah
B	was it?

B	oh I see what you mean no yes no that's his surname
A	yeah yeah but an old
B	but yeah yeah yeah
A	Oldfield as a surname is quite funny
A	yeah
A	but the er the poems were my favourite bit what was it?
B	mm
A	er
B	oh there was a
[ANNOTATION]	Oldfield is a first name.	Contradiction
A	something something
B	happy
A	I felt morose
B	yeah er but a wasp
A	dead wasp but what was the first line?
B	oh yeah
A	it was like erm
B	that's it yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A felt like loosing his/her senses.	Entailment
A	that's the one
B	yeah
A	what? what?
B	you had to be there didn't you?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A should be located in a specific place.	Entailment
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A should be located in a specific plave.	Entailment
A	yeah yeah
B	you try and sort of like tell that to anybody it's like
A	what?
B	what?
A	you what?
A	oh that's not funny that's just weird
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A finds what speaker B mentioned no strange at all.	Contradiction
A	but it's hilarious
B	yeah
A	I've been reading my er my book where is it? it was here there it is
B	oh yeah?
A	my book today quite a bit
B	oh a new book
A	since I got home
B	oh that's the one your friend got you isn't it?
A	yeah
B	well you cor you've
A	yeah made a
B	chomped into that
A	made a dent haven't I?
B	yeah
A	cos the erm cos the end bit is just the the additional material I'm probably almost a quarter of the way through
B	blimey that's good
A	yeah it's quite good it it was quite easy reading
B	is it?
A	yeah but it er the plot I quite like the characters the plot isn't isn't doing anything particularly original for me
B	oh okay
A	but I'm hoping that's gonna change
B	yeah yeah
A	further
B	you've still got time
A	yes
B	I'm very much enjoying my Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman
A	oh you are now are you?
B	he's he's such a clever writer such a funny writer you know
A	yeah
B	but erm there was a particular section in the book that I just read where er I mean basically he's a sort of teenage boy living at home his parents it's a very dysfunctional family
A	yeah
B	his parents are sort of heading for a break-up his grandfather and grandmother are living in the house as well his grandfather's seriously ill with cancer but he doesn't know that and
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	way out erm and er doesn't sound very exciting does it so far?
B	but his grandfather fought in the war erm and he was at the battle of the Somme and he was erm really badly injured and he still carries these injuries or sort of you know sort of the aftermath of them to this day
A	mm
B	and one of the things is that it it was really quite graphic and descriptive and it was a bit oh he was blown up in this field you know he went up in the air and literally he his his guts were
A	okay
B	yeah yeah
A	lovely right
B	and er and he was left for days in the field but he was discovered and there's a reason why he kind of survived which we won't go into cos that's really that'll just make you go even more ah
A	okay yeah don't
B	but anyway there's a section of the book where Thomas the grandson he's kind of him and his friend keep going up to crab pools and blowing up crabs it's such a typical you know boy thing teenage boy thing to be doing activity
A	yeah
B	you know it's like they make all these little mini explosives and you know like my brothers used to have these little dunno if you've ever heard of them caps where you throw them on the floor
A	yeah
B	and they explode you used to be able to buy them in the shops
B	right
A	yeah
B	erm but anyway so he he makes these little explosives which he then ties to crabs in the rock pool and just him and his friend watch them go up basically er and they've specifically
A	I yeah I I hate it already
B	but but he's describing going to this rock pool erm on a mission he's got this really good explosive and the way the writer weaves it in is he thinks he's gonna go and do this but actually
A	yeah
B	being with the grandad on the war
A	oh right
B	field
A	I see
B	and that
