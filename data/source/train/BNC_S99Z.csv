A	yeah cos that's one of the like that's the sort of trade that you need to learn isn't it really? so
B	yeah at the moment in the in the city the biggest things are about anti money laundering
C	mm
B	erm know your client where's the money coming from?
A	yeah I know
B	preventing the financing of terrorism it's huge and
A	yeah
B	and there's huge careers in that whole area of compliance and
A	yeah
B	regulatory
D	are you still eating prawns cat?
B	you know I mean it's it can be probably a boring but also quite an exciting place to be at the moment
A	yeah
B	and I I recognised this two or three years ago and I actually joked about you could get your son a compliance manual and he's got a career for life
A	yeah
B	you know there's a lot a lot in that it's the biggest growing department in every financial company is their compliance team
A	yeah
B	so
C	yeah
A	the
C	cos the fines are enormous
B	oh the fines are
C	completely
B	astronomical
C	outweigh the costs yeah
A	yeah but that's the point it's just trying to
B	there's
A	deter it happening again
C	mm
B	there's like a trillion they've worked out there's trillions of dollars of fraud
C	mm
B	it's absolutely huge
A	where does this
B	it goes to the regulator and the regulator uses it to fund their more investigators for more banks or to change the rules or to tighten up the rules or to prosecute so it's a fine
C	mm
B	that kind of goes back to the central governing body
A	mm
B	so that they can then make themselves better and they are and they're buying software like my company's got so they're gonna be more advanced than the actual financial companies themselves to be able to go and do those sort of analysis projects and things like that so you know it's it's a bit of a race against time at the moment but what we've found is with anti money laundering is that erm those that are involved they'll set up a shell company
A	mm
B	erm Geneva or the Cayman Islands or
A	cleaning the money
B	and what we're trying to do is we're trying to identify patterns in those steps so if a trade starts in Switzerland goes to a Swiss bank and ends in Switzerland it's probably safe
A	mm
B	but not everybody looks at the whole the whole chain each bank looks at them and the next party who could be
A	yeah
B	another friendly bank that next
A	but if you look at it as a whole
B	but if you look at the whole transaction you think mm that's why? why are they doing the transaction like that? so
A	so how did how did you get into that then? like that's a really specific
B	because I've been in financial services for all my career and
unknown_female	where's the sprayer? I am being absolutely plagued with those little bastards now
B	ah it's oh erm just by the drinks cabinet inside erm
A	yeah
B	well I'm on Linkedin and er I've I've always used it and I've been a member of Linkedin for quite a few years
A	it's how you network ain't it? and make
B	yeah it's really good for in in my industry and and probably in others but I
A	yeah
B	and now we've got ex coppers that work for us and we've got these data architect types and you know techie really techie people but also that understand erm investigations so I've
A	a real mix of people
B	I find it very exciting actually cos it's kind of it's not just financial services it can go and be used to analyse industrial espionage it can be used to analyse construction projects where people might be erm claiming to work on two projects the same time and putting timesheets in it picks up things like that it picks up where bids are being won
A	yeah
B	if you ingest all the data and start kinda shuffling everything around and throw it back it it starts making connections which is really exciting
A	yeah
B	so
A	cos there's a lot of that I bet that goes on in the
B	yeah yeah
A	married to so and so so we're gonna get this contract and
B	I mean one of the things was erm a company where the guy's a manager and he's signing off stationery I mean companies buy stationery all the time
unknown_female	no no it's
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The last speaker doesnt have enough information about the contract but it seems that the last speaker is agree with it	Neutral
B	so he's always buying paper and pens and things like that but as it turns out he was getting his firm to pay for fictitious invoices and he was the owner of the stationery company
A	mm
B	have a look at the emails of my staff so
A	right yeah it is really interesting
B	we find a lot of unknowns and every time there's fraud or some insider dealing or some transactions that have erm that look a bit dodgy
A	different places where not necessarily
A	look at all at once
B	absolutely
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	About the fraud and suspicious transactions and their connections with  stationery company	Neutral
B	you know and what we're trying to do is connect all the dots and I think it's a great so
A	yeah it sounds really interesting
B	the big
A	mm
B	they're looking for a new investigative system
A	right
[ANNOTATION]	The last speaker is agree that there is a need for new investigative system	Entailment
B	to help them with fraud across all aspects of fraud you know because the
A	sector in there
B	fraud they want to get it right and then they want to start shifting it out to other parts of the country so we're bidding we we haven't won a bid but we're in a process of bidding erm and I just think that's fantastic cos my mum used to work for
A	right
B	putting all the cases together for court
A	yeah
unknown_female	I must have
[ANNOTATION]	The last speaker does not work against fraud.	Contradiction
B	so I kind of feel a little bit of a connection there
unknown_female	chillies on my fingers cos I've touched my face and my face is stinging even though
B	mm
unknown_female	since I've touched the chillies I've washed my hands twice
unknown_female	I'm now burning round my mouth
B	well have some more drink
unknown_female	oh
B	don't rub your eyes
[ANNOTATION]	The last speaker is not sure that she washed her hands correctly or not.	Neutral
unknown_female	oh yes
C	don't pick your nose
B	so yeah it's good you know there's a lot
A	on his own yeah
B	yeah yeah
B	and he's gonna come and live in
A	yeah
unknown_female	I need to go for a wee sorry
A	see that'll be good cos you can keep an eye on him as well
B	yeah I mean I'm not gonna
A	like
B	sort of pussyfoot around him but
A	no but like you know what he's you know what I mean
B	I think the if he
unknown_female	oh okay
B	but if he lives with me for six months then decides he wants to go and move in with some
A	mm mm
B	he's launched he's got a job he's on the career ladder and he's living in
A	mm
B	you know so
A	well I'm working on something at the moment which is similar in a way to what you do but not it is investigative but it's not fraud
B	yeah
A	so like you can tell I'm from the north and I can tell you're from the south it's just a way of speaking and the way
B	mm
A	that you use your tongue and pronounce things differently to how I do
B	mm
A	so like I'll erm drop Ts I'll drop words out of a sentence and stuff like that whereas people who are generally from the south don't normally do that they normally speak a proper sentence so to speak
unknown_female	do you want another beer?
unknown_female	oh no I'm fine thanks I've still got some left
A	erm and erm I I erm work for the British National Corpus collecting data erm and recording stuff with people talking so me and
B	yeah
A	and what they do is they put this erm recording through a piece of software that picks out words and picks out erm
B	mm
A	so this British National Corpus is normally used for erm like language studies speech therapists erm all that like how language is used and what it's used for in what way
B	yeah
A	stuff like that so that's sort of a similar thing and it's
B	yeah
A	just collecting a lot of data and then finding out
B	it's what you do with the data after you've collected it really is the key thing and you know people have now are catching on to the fact that there's so much information out there if you can harness it you know you can do so much and learn so much that you couldn't see before you know cos most people work in isolation companies even if you work for a big bank and I've worked for a big bank my last firm was
A	yeah and a lot of organisation
B	a lot of staff pulling data out and sticking it into spreadsheets and things like that so nobody really has a view what's going on across the company and they might have clients in here and clients over there and they're not using
A	yeah
B	that information
A	not using it
B	so there's so much more we can do and I think every sort of five or six years something new comes up in technology which
A	that allows it
B	kind of blows everybody away and you know big data is the big thing at the moment it's a the buzzword
A	it is er
B	it's quite interesting actually now that I've updated my er Linkedin profile where I talk about big data and smart data I get a lot more people enquiring on my
unknown_female	mm
B	are not related to what I'm doing in my day to day job so I think that
A	mm
B	if you're out there in the industry and you're looking for people that have got experience in this latest technology you start searching around to see who has so I think it's
unknown_female	mm
B	what we're doing keep
A	see the
B	updating it
A	yeah that's what I like about my degree
B	mm
A	analysing it and then breaking it down into an essay or into a research project stuff like that and I think
B	well a lot comes out of the universities a lot of what industry picks up comes out from research that the universities do and I think they do a a good job
A	mm
B	and sometimes some of the competitive products that are out there in the market have come from universities you know
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	mm
B	you know it was actually a university developed programme
A	yeah
B	which is still used across the world you know as one of the underlying programming languages with things have moved on but a lot of it came out of the technology and the study that people do so
A	yeah
B	it can really go places
A	I think the universities are fantastic
B	yeah
A	like the the office they offer like erm
B	mm
A	and it's it's really interesting stuff
B	are we gonna eat inside tonight do you think?
unknown_female	yeah I think so
unknown_female	who said that?
B	is that you
unknown_female	the trouble is yeah well also if we start late
A	just go and get a jumper
B	oh goodness we put the cover on the pool when we came up earlier
unknown_female	mm
B	to keep the heat in there
unknown_female	cool
B	nothing to do down there
A	oh it smells fantastic
unknown_female	yep
unknown_female	I would assume
B	I think I'll go and lay the table in the other room actually I'm getting a bit cold
unknown_female	yeah I think we'll eat inside
B	if we're gonna eat in there yeah? okey dokes take my various liquids
unknown_female	have to see might be some stars out tonight
unknown_female	that would be good
B	shall I erm lay out for
unknown_female	I don't think she'll be back in time I think she'll be late
unknown_female	so
unknown_female	so she'll eat
B	but
B	I'm gonna I'm gonna lay out the table in here cos we're gonna eat in here
unknown_female	yes I think so is that alright?
B	yeah
unknown_female	mm
A	saw loads of
unknown_female	yeah
A	like I thought she er when she were talking about it she just meant like a bank in the city
unknown_female	yeah
A	if that makes sense like I didn't realise that that were it
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	oh
C	I've got the boar marinading for tomorrow
D	oh excellent
A	oh are we having boar?
C	so I need to get up early and and do that
A	I'm not here
D	oh no you're not here no
A	can you save us some please?
C	might be a little bit saved
A	thank you
C	little snack size pieces
A	I love your boar stew it's amazing
D	did you shoot it?
C	erm I don't know
D	mm
C	is the answer
D	okay
C	I shot one whether this is part of that one I don't know
D	so it's a bit like a World War Two fighter pilot
C	no no no no
D	no?
C	what it is is that what what we do when we go up there it's very democratic actually it's very good is we decide based on who's found traces of boar in woods where we all we each go out and check our own little area
D	mm
C	and that helps us decide where we should go shooting one in the morning and one in the afternoon usually erm
D	mm
C	but what it means is that there's no favouritism as to who gets which slot and you know this is my post I'm here all the time sort of thing so you actually get to see a lot of the countryside and a lot of different things rather than just standing in one place every time you go out
D	mm
C	to a particular place
C	with the what? I didn't do anything with them they're in the sink to be washed
B	you know you put the forks somewhere earlier?
C	I put them in the sink to be washed
B	in the sink?
C	yeah
B	okay
C	but they I think they've been did you wash them?
B	he said they're in the sink
A	the sink? oh they're in the erm dishwasher
C	oh right they went into the dishwasher I left them out cos we needed them for tea
A	oh right sorry
A	it's not on
C	erm so if there's twenty people then what gets killed gets put into twenty bags
D	divided yeah okay
C	and again lots are done so that whoever's butchered it doesn't get to say you know I'll keep the fillet steak this side sort of thing
D	mm
C	so you end up with a bag that could be one that you killed it could be one that someone else killed you know and depending on how many have been killed that day you might not get anything some days
D	mm
C	erm so genuinely you don't know I mean people know who killed it when it gets shot cos obviously the person who's pointing their gun at it when it falls over it's fairly obviously who shot it some cases it isn't when it's running across a field and everybody's shooting it and you don't know who actually shot it
D	oh dear it doesn't stand a chance there
C	well no they they do get away
[ANNOTATION]	The bullets used for the shots are semi-round nose.	Neutral
C	yeah
C	and find them
D	mm
C	and then when you get the meat you keep it in the freezer for three months
D	oh right so it's it it takes three months to be absolutely sure this thing is er
C	yes is dead
D	yeah okay
C	so the stuff we're eating is basically something that was shot
D	mm
C	the time we ran the things
D	mm
C	and one I'll start doing now is I will start carving more interesting pieces cos you don't just have to do stews cos although it's very good for slow cooked it can be a tough meat if you get a younger one a smaller one you know fifty kilos something like that it's it can be quite nice meat you could actually barbecue it or
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The meat should be stored in the freezer for more than one month.	Entailment
C	do other things with it as well
D	yeah
C	the trouble is that the stew is just so nice it's just like you almost don't wanna do anything else
A	I know
[ANNOTATION]	Stew is better when used spicies on the meat.	Neutral
D	yeah I mean you know who would have thought?
C	yeah
unknown_female	when erm the rice is neaArly done I'll do the prawns
unknown_female	yes
B	is it?
unknown_female	yes
B	shall we finish it off?
