A	yeah
B	I mean I was like uh
A	I dunno
B	um
A	yeah
B	um so uh is
A	it's no it's about yeah this one's about girl groups
B	it's it's yeah cos I think no no no this is alright
A	ah she looks so chavvy
B	no this is alright
A	shall I turn it over?
B	no no no no this is fine
A	yeah
B	uh
A	she's a proper chav though Cheryl Cole
B	unless unless there's something you wanted to watch was there something?
A	um it is sorry is this something I wanted to watch or is there something?
B	unless that you you said you did you want to turn it over to watch something else? Is that?
A	oh no no I just um
B	right
A	yeah I don't know
B	like a short one isn't it so there's uh
A	what d'you mean?
B	Cheryl Cole's really famous I know but I dunno  I dunno  what what happened to the others
A	um well so Kimberley the one that's like the most normal out of all of them
B	is that the one with the ginger hair?
A	was she from like Warrington? No so there's the gingery one
B	I can see there's a blonde one there
A	and then there's the blonde one Sarah Harding and then there's the other one called Kimberley
B	right
A	I sound like I'm a massive fan
B	no no no you don't you just know like pop trivia
A	and then
B	kimberley?
A	yeah
B	which one's that one?
A	that's the Irish one
B	oh right
A	this was like quite early on I think they all look quite young
B	yeah
B	all I remember is that Cheryl Cole was
A	that's the
B	she sort of stood out as being very defensive and like quite sort of boisterous but like defensive like if you  if you
A	in interviews you mean?
B	if you tried to
A	Don't mess with her? She's just well hard isn't she you know?
B	she is pretty from uh you know quite a rough background isn't she so?
A	yeah she is
B	um
A	I remember this song like
B	so it's like
A	look at them in their combats
B	it's quite sort of  quite sort of  like The Gap that those outfits there
A	like
B	the old nineties The Gap and the the uh
A	yeah it's like
A	it was really ninety like nineties styles like combats and stuff like the
B	yeah
A	I don't know if I know this one
B	with a sixties look
A	but she's playing the guitar that's quite unusual isn't it like it didn't really get like women musicians like on the telly
B	it's that's unusual for the sixties to have
A	yeah but that's singing mainly we didn't you didn't really get like women guitarists for a long time
B	oh yeah no no no that was when there there are there haven't been that many sort of female like guitar rock stars with guitars have there?
A	no
B	I mean
A	yeah but I don't know if she's in the same sort of
B	yeah I was
A	everyone loves a bit of Dolly Parton
B	uh the majority of female singers seem to just be tend to not have guitars like that I mean
A	yeah
B	uh
A	got trousers on and everything
B	they have like proper sixties uh haircuts though
A	I like that
B	um is that like?
A	actually the I like sort of  I like the sort of  shorter ones that are bigger
B	what d'you call that? It's like a
A	um I don't know
B	it's kind of round and like big at the top so like a beehive like
A	it's a bit like a  a bit like a  beehive yeah but it's also like ur um like a Lego man's haircut a bit
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	kind of heard of them but
A	these were on uh ones that were on like a talent show one
B	oh did they?
A	I still don't understand what was happening on The Voice last night like what was that? I don't understand the
B	all all I know is that it's is like you choose based on the sound not the performer
A	yeah
B	must presumably they just apply and then maybe they get filtered down but I don't know
A	yeah
B	um I could have a little look on the
A	no it's alright
B	smartphone to to to uh
A	are the is the window open?
B	I mean it's it's a good idea but also they started Britain's Got uh Talent as well but I don't really like that very much so I didn't watch it
A	is it Simon Cowell that you don't like though?
B	partly
A	Cos David Walliams is on it now and he was like
B	the Simon Cowell element
A	no but he's a bit
B	ah but it's it's from the comedian's irony isn't it? Comedian comedians
A	yeah but
B	uh it's a bit like Ricky Gervais doing  Ricky Gervais doing  bad jokes
A	it was a bit annoying
B	it's like
A	oh he's terrible Ricky Gervais I really don't like him
B	no I don't like him
A	oh I really don't like him
B	like um um
A	it's like he's made not funny like loads of money out of not being funny
B	there there is an element of like maybe overratedness maybe going on there but uh he's popular so
A	he's stupid
B	yeah you can  you can  make you know you you can achieve a lot by uh by kind of not being that talented I think or
A	nah
B	yeah but there's there's also Extras isn't there?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A adores Ricky Gervais.	Contradiction
A	and Extras yeah that is quite funny
B	oh yeah he's terrible as a stand-up isn't he? That's his worst thing that's his worst skill
A	it was just like
B	he's very popular though but just can't stand
A	oh excuse me
B	yeah Science was pretty bad actually but his stand-up is really bad and
[ANNOTATION]	The Extras was not something serious.	Entailment
A	but why do people go and see it like?
B	I don't know
A	is he I haven't
B	but I don't think you'd find it very funny yeah
A	well I don't
[ANNOTATION]	Most people like Science.	Neutral
B	I think there's like loads of like random like world leaders and stuff like like Mahmood Ahmedinejad is on Twitter or something
A	is he? Is it him though or is it a spoof one cos the spoof ones are my favourite
B	well I probably think he he has  he has  like a  like a  main official one maybe
A	there's like a
B	is there  is there  like Steven Hawking?
A	uh I don't know
B	oh yeah like the official one
A	I've got like um Arnold Schwarzenegger just cos I thought it was funny
B	like Kim Jong Kim Il  Kim Il  Sung
[ANNOTATION]	The Mahmood Ahmedinejad is in Twitter for 5 months now.	Neutral
A	but then
B	oh yeah
A	and like there was loads of like  loads of like  you having a laugh?
B	oh yeah it's good yeah yeah yeah
A	like loads of like really
B	yeah and there's a lot of like anything in football you're gonna get lots of spoofs
A	yeah
B	um so it might be
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers are enjoying their conversation.	Entailment
A	yeah that's true
B	I think it would be fair that everybody should have the right to their own uh name you know to their own
A	well you can get it validated I think
B	but of course some people have
A	on Twitter like you can get it like um you can write like accredited like Stephen Fry's one is like got like a little badge
B	oh yeah I see
A	so you can get it like especially if you
B	the best thing I saw about Twitter is you um
A	so there's the that's one I've got like from Cheryl Cole
B	Chery Kerl
A	there you can read it
B	uh April Fool's Day
A	it's stupid
B	um
A	that's crazy I watched this last week
B	what's this? What is it?
A	um it's about Sandhurst so it's about like
B	oh oh yeah
A	no I'll find something else but it was quite interesting but I don't understand why people would wanna go in the army and just be like shouted at in the face
B	oh yeah there was a girl there wasn't there and?
A	yeah and there she was like you're not up to standard
B	fair enough
B	yeah what d'you think about celebrities? D'you think it's moral or like a bit dodgy to have like prying cameras in celebrities' lives and everybody getting
A	I think like it
B	yeah obviously like within the law and uh
A	I don't think like if you're inside your own house
B	it's a bit of a gray area for the law isn't it because um
A	yeah
B	how much monitoring are they allowed to legally do like can they stand opposite your house in on the road where it's a public road
A	it must be horrible
B	personally I think like um they should ban uh
A	yeah but but then also like people do things on purpose don't they? People encourage you know
B	yeah and that's bad as well like
A	yeah I know but
B	I mean if that's
A	is the problem not though people
B	I would ban I would definitely ban paparazzis from going within a certain distance of people's houses
A	is the
B	well I'd ban any like any taking of photos of um
A	is it not the people who buy the pictures and therefore the people who read the magazines and that? That's the problem really
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	I think I would probably do that if I ruled the world
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	no cos usually it's like like me and I just press the wrong button
B	no no no no uh like it sometimes just it just dies doesn't it?
A	well I just put new things in so
B	what it should do is it should make like a bleep like when it's died
A	yeah yeah
B	um a charge my alarm but uh
A	oh there's I have got Ricky Gervais on Twitter look
B	genius
A	oh I suppose he does a bit round the eyes
B	he was actually quite a good looking guy in his  in his  younger days though
A	I don't think
B	I dunno no Ricky Gervais had a was quite good looking in the old days wasn't he?
A	well
B	when when he had that Bowie
A	the David Bowie thing?
B	he's always had a David Bowie obsession hasn't he? Uh I think he may be going a bit thin on top
A	think so?
B	I'm not sure
A	I wonder what your
B	is that sort of Siamese is it what's the type of cat that's got like white with like a
A	I dunno
B	so we're definitely not getting a cat then
A	well I'm allergic to cats
B	unless you stop being allergic
A	that's not very nice on the cat though
B	no just we'll just um
A	well
B	so but you don't wanna get a dog you wanna get a Jack Russell don't you?
A	um
A	cats just turn their nose up at you and just like scratch things and
B	no no no they don't always turn their nose up at you they
A	yeah
B	uh they come in you know they come on your bed and like they share like they
A	that's not nice that's not a nice idea if I've made some food I wanna eat it
B	well it's like a fluffy like mobile cushion isn't it?
A	well I like cushions
B	you don't have to really do much to take care of it apart from feed it
A	yeah but why have a pet if you don't have to do anything to it? Like you may as well just get
B	it's it's a mobile cushion
A	yeah but
B	that heats
A	if you could eat it at the end that might be better
B	if you could eat it? Well you can eat it but um
B	most people view it as a friend and like they wouldn't like eat a friend if a friend died
A	no
B	if I died would you eat me?
A	well it depends how hungry I was
B	is that legal? I don't think it is
A	eating another person?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	Cos um if I donate my organs to um
A	to my dinner
B	to to your
A	I wouldn't eat you
B	might be tasty
A	well
B	mind you I'd be a bit old
A	let's hope so
B	old and uh you know
A	grizzly?
B	nasty
A	yeah I'll just keep your head in a jar
B	like they will  they will  be able to grow um artificial they'll be able to grow uh meat
A	cows? Yeah
B	they don't have any pain
A	well I think definitely by then
B	um in the direction of like perhaps of removing the need to um to to kill animals for uh for food like by growing the muscle tissue
A	stupid interview
A	ah Adele
B	lot of Adele isn't there?
A	is that some sort of jibe
B	uh several metres squared of Adele
A	although I sort of don't really like her when she was going on about like whinging about having to pay tax it's like oh poor you
B	metres cubed
A	well they've just changed it haven't they recently but yeah but it was fifty
B	they've slightly
A	but it was fifty percent tax
B	um
A	but if you're gonna make like ten million pounds then it's five million pounds is much the same ten million pounds I imagine
B	ah well I don't know I mean
A	yeah but I think  I think  it doesn't matter
B	you you probably would be benefitting from you know from the tax in certain ways but uh
A	yeah but I mean
B	yeah I mean ideally the the there
A	I don't have a problem with taxing people who've got millions of pounds half of it
B	uh well yeah it's it's controversial isn't it because obviously they're gonna  they're gonna  say well I uh I've got if I earn um a million pounds a year and you're taking half of that that then
A	yeah but that's more than enough to live on
B	they they would feel they're not  they're not  getting as much back as like as other people are I suppose
A	does it not work
B	um I'm not I don't know much that much about it
A	it is man
B	well
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah so like
B	yeah
A	thirty percent
B	I've heard comments coming from your direction that you you believe that you pay uh rather a large amount of tax
A	I do
B	and you you only pay like uh you know the the sort of the more the lower rate isn't about twenty-five for you I guess
A	I know it's annoying
B	um
A	yeah I can
B	I think some people just don't seem to mind and others really hate it they think tax is theft so
A	but
B	that's what you hear from the you know sort of you know sort of centre right or libertarian type of people
A	yeah
B	all the the sort of the the main strategy of government is to sort of keep things more or less the same unless unless you have to change something um
A	yeah
B	they wouldn't make too many changes but they do they have made some changes they have lowered slightly the like some they have lowered tax for wealthy people
A	that's just Tories isn't it? It's just their  it's just their  like
B	yeah the like the sort of uh of the  of the of the  economic liberal people who who would obviously they believe that if you lower tax then you encourage uh global business and that view is espoused by you know like the Economist magazine
A	it's unsurprising that they should do that
B	so the latest magazine uh the Economist's front cover that I saw was um
A	yeah
B	uh Cameron's budget for global uh for what was it? Cameron's budget for
A	yeah
B	and there was a picture of like basically complimenting and
A	his big yeah
B	actually it was actually Osborne and you know
A	yeah
B	the best thing  the best thing  with this is
A	I was trying to say ten million pounds is as much as saying five million pounds like
B	well that's clearly not the same is it?
A	no but if you're just a person like the salary that I get
B	well that is a hundred million pounds the same as fifty million um well does it? Is it are you doing like a  like a  linear relationship?
A	well yes
B	oh yeah no I mean I kind of see I kind of know what I kind of see that point of view uh but obviously if you're an investor that you know they these guys like
A	yeah
B	the problem with
A	mhm
B	uh so therefore I suppose that uh that that that a Marxist view would criticise uh having you know the
A	yeah
B	uh for an individual without actually doing any labour
A	yeah
B	um but the reality is that the individuals and investors do tend to
A	well I mean
B	it's a bit like uh you know if you wanna
A	yeah
B	and more like regulatory
A	yeah
B	and then for example you know Mr Wetherspoon put like pro-Cameron like in stuff in in Wetherspoon's
A	I know he's not
B	I mean he's it's not a coincidence that he's that his pubs are based on George Orwell's idea of a good pub and you know he he will have read George Orwell presumably because he dislikes state interference
A	but one of the best things
B	yeah this is the redistributive redistributative
A	okay well it's not
B	in the  in the  Scandinavian countries yeah
A	yeah so it's like they set it so that wages at the top can't be I can't remember how many times like
B	yeah
A	eight times or five times or something more than
B	yeah I mean that's kind of
A	that means every uh that drags everyone up like that seems like a better idea
B	well yeah I mean like those kind of countries are what might be called socialist by American um like Americans
A	that seems a bit more Marxist
B	but yeah that was the point I was gonna make it's like I was talking about the European bust-up and like UK was like Germany was gonna was trying to force and like EU was trying to force England to to to
A	to what?
B	reel reel in its bankers a bit like to to restrict its its banking
A	ah reign in?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	you know that's what we but they're gonna leave the Gherkin leave the
A	yeah
B	whatever they're all gonna  they're all gonna  go uh to gonna go to America and Shanghai and they're gonna make us look like a right bunch of losers uh compared to Germany but the yeah the point I was gonna make is that
[ANNOTATION]	They are going to make the UK seem like the best country ever.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	even though it has more tight regulations so like it's not uh
A	yeah yeah
B	if like there has to be a kind of national pride amongst businesses within countries like in like if you want good investment a lot of it's gotta be
A	yeah
B	there's it's companies cos they they're proud of their country you know what I mean? I don't know who that is
A	you do man
B	ginger lesbian?
B	well I know one ginger lesbian
A	no not her
[ANNOTATION]	B knows someone who is part of the LGTBQ2+ group.	Entailment
B	she's uh uh a ginger haired lesbian to to put it rather bluntly
A	no not her she's um she's got like a very distinctive haircut
B	oh right is she um? I didn't realise?
A	is she what?
B	oh yeah I know her she has one of those those harsh uh
A	oh my phone's ringing it's
B	okay um
A	D'you wanna?
B	I'll just pause this then
[ANNOTATION]	The girl who has red hair is straight.	Contradiction
A	hello? Hi
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A just got a call from someone.	Entailment
