D	what do you call a big bird then
A	a blackbird
C	a blackbird is
D	blackbird
C	oh yes it yeah
D	it had been hit
A	oh right
D	you could tell and it was
A	staggering and flapping yeah
D	you know on the verge and it was flapping its wings and it sort of and we were stopped there weren't we for traffic and
C	yes
D	it was right there and you know it was really
A	he's sort of orange on his front like a coral sort of orange
C	oh right yeah
D	mm
A	he's got a bit of a greyish patch on one wing and the rest is black
D	oh
A	with a bit of white I think
C	mm hm
A	I just knew what it was because have you seen those Robert Fuller pictures paintings?
D	mm
C	no
A	he does a lot of wildlife animals

A	it was in the catalogue and I found it
C	oh
A	so that's how I know what it is
D	mm
C	oh
D	it's bullfinches
C	yeah
D	and it'll be no doubt being so colourful as that
A	that must be the boy
D	a male
A	yeah I'd imagine
D	mm
A	he seems to be there about the same time when I come down in the morning putting the kettle on look out of the window he's there
D	yes
C	mm
A	seems to have a routine
D	yeah he'll have a a route
A	mm
D	mm mm
C	well we have a robin don't we? and he always sits on the same part of the fence
A	branch yeah that's his spot
D	yeah
C	yes
A	yeah
D	yeah yeah that that's his perch really
C	yes
B	mm
C	yes
D	is he?
A	yeah that's about the same time late afternoon I think when it's got warm
D	yeah yeah the
B	mm
A	it's gone into the stones and he just lies himself out full length
D	yeah
A	with his front paws out and his back paws stretched out really relaxed
D	that's it
A	they really
D	you can't look at
A	yeah
D	ah and he's got a fur coat on hasn't he?
A	I know as well yeah
A	but he just looks all sort of loose
C	mm
A	and relaxed and you know like you'd just pick him up and all his bones would just slip to the bottom he just looks really fluid
C	mm yeah
D	well that that's another thing really with er cats and and er furry things er rabbits in particular that's how they get picked up
A	mm
D	you know the the skin and the fur is like loose
A	yes yes
D	it is like a coat on
A	yes
D	and you grab it and really
A	and all the rest slips to the bottom doesn't it?
D	yeah
C	the weight goes to the bottom
D	and that's how the mother
A	yes carries the baby kitten yeah
D	say yeah yeah say erm a tiger
A	mm
D	moving her kittens like
A	mm
D	and get them like that in her teeth and carry them to the new spot and come back and get the next one and put one there
A	yes
D	oh yes
C	oh right
A	and he wanted to have a go
D	oh right
A	sitting on the stones
D	mm
A	and they were just looking at each other nose to nose touching
C	oh were they?
D	were they?
A	like that
D	mm
A	for ages and it was who blinks first is out
A	and they were there for minutes
D	mm
A	and neither would look away
C	oh
D	was it the same type of cat like or
A	one was black and one was striped
D	mm
A	yeah
C	and and did they move in the end?
D	a tabby
A	eventually the striped cat went and laid back down
C	oh
A	and the black cat was sitting up all the time
C	oh
D	mm
C	they didn't get it
A	no
D	he could he could have laid down though couldn't he?
A	he could have laid down but it was still
D	mm
C	mm
B	that striped cat is very relaxed all the way round but
D	well obviously that's his territory isn't it? that that's his route
A	yes
B	no it's very it's quite shy
C	oh
D	mm
A	if we go up to him he scarpers straight away
D	was it nervous?
A	I can't get near enough I can't touch him
D	mm mm he'll
C	yeah
D	he'll live a long while then
A	yeah
D	because this timidity in particularly in birds
A	mm
D	in fact
A	twitching around yes
D	yeah and they'll move mm
A	yeah
D	because it's
A	yes
D	cos they're so well camouflaged and so the best thing to do
C	we had a lovely black cat that came
D	mm
C	and he used to stand at the back door if the door was closed
D	talk to us
C	and it would meow at meow meow meow until you opened the door
D	to come in
C	and then he's come in and he'd walk all round the house
A	yes
D	yeah he'd have a look round
C	and erm
A	seems alright
C	at one time I was writing at the table and he jumped on to the table to me
A	oh god
D	and then he got sat on the window ledge looking out
C	yes he did yeah
A	he was sat up like you say looking out mm
C	yeah mm
A	and doesn't he come now?
C	no he hasn't been for about a month now
D	no
A	oh right
C	so we don't know whether he's got knocked over or
D	something's happened
A	no
C	whether he's moved I don't know but I haven't seen him
A	yeah
D	but erm I used to sometimes see when I looked out at maybe six o'clock on a morning
A	mm
D	mm
C	he was a lovely cat though
A	yeah
C	we used to give him some milk didn't we?
D	mm
C	yeah see what there was

C	no
D	and then he he brought a friend
C	oh yes

A	to see whether you actually can
C	oh right
A	get used to it
C	I knew when I was small I used to absolutely hate cabbage
A	mm
C	hated it
A	it's not a pleasant texture really is it?
C	no
A	yes yeah
C	I don't like it too crunchy
B	I thought spinach was quite a traditional thing to grow in a zone allotment and that's
A	mm
C	mm yes

C	I remember once at work when I was at
A	oh right
C	I said oh
A	oh that's good
C	right but I've never been bothered whether people like me or not if they like me
A	mm

C	I'm I'm not one for currying favour with anybody
A	no
C	I can't be bothered
A	no I can't
C	I don't think it's worth it if they like you

C	oh right
A	if he goes to his mum's it's about six if he doesn't it's about three
C	oh right
A	mm
C	mm
A	whereas you did used to get you know quite a good deep amount
D	mm
A	but after so long those disappeared and they got some new soup dishes that were smaller
D	oh is it?
B	yeah
D	well it would be something like that then that's been it
A	mm
B	what's the soup of the day?

B	yes
A	yes oh right
D	I've had a look at that
A	sorry yes
D	hey
D	eh?
A	you're right it's too hard
D	yeah definitely for me
D	I wasn't very good at algebra anyway
C	is it too hard for you
B	no
C	it's not too hard for
C	I know
D	he is a hundred times cleverer than what I am
B	to be honest if that came up in the exam I'd be quite happy
C	oh would you?
C	oh right
B	mm
C	so how will it be different this next term then
B	erm well I suppose the modules becoming more specialised to accounting finance and management
C	oh yeah
B	erm so
C	mm
B	so it's it's more numerical
C	mm right
A	yeah yeah
B	that's a good thing in my opinion
C	yes yes
D	but you're obviously sort of
B	yes
D	mm entirely different from your early years isn't it?
B	yeah
D	you know you're coming into like the real world now you you can sort of see
B	yes
D	mm
B	mm
D	you know as you go through life you might think I'll I'll take a course in that and either add something to it or you can have a change of of direction completely because you've got enough up there to be able to
C	mm they're pretty aren't they?
D	mm hey
C	mm
D	this is posh is this
A	mm
D	it shows
A	nice aren't they?
C	pretty aren't they? yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah it's funny I was only only
A	yeah I have
C	and I I don't I use mine special
A	no
B	I suppose your china is like a best set
A	the best yeah well that's the old-fashioned way isn't it?
C	mm
B	yes
C	yes
A	but I had er
C	mm
A	and then I added to it and I saw these in Bins one time
C	mm
A	and I started getting two
C	yes
A	now it's
C	and do you know there isn't a china department in Bins now
A	no you wouldn't be able to do that now would you?
C	and the this is what I was saying to dad If you wanted a china tea set now
A	mm
C	you'd have to order it wouldn't you?
A	yeah
C	mm
B	in
C	oh yes yes
B	but I'm a little bit worried about it because erm they're applying for planning permission to split the shop so
A	oh yeah they have haven't they?
B	I'm not sure what's happening there exactly
C	into what like
A	don't know that's what we don't know
C	no no
A	whether they're only going to have half of it or?
C	mm
D	that's what happened with Laura Ashley's though wasn't it?
A	yeah
D	mm
A	and now it's gone
D	mm that's the result isn't it?
A	or whether they're going to have half for the china shop and half for a tea shop
B	yes
A	mm
B	cos one of them is change of use to a restaurant
A	yeah
C	oh right yeah
A	tea shop gosh
B	I think what's amazing is how well they've lasted
A	yeah they have lasted a long time they have got a tea shop now
C	have they?
A	but it's on the next floor
C	oh is it?
A	but I won't go up
C	mm
A	you know cos it's such an old building
C	mm
A	I feel panicked in there the ceiling's too low
C	mm
A	the staircase is really
B	narrow
C	narrow
A	caged in
C	mm
A	and it starts making me get in a flap it's too small
C	mm
A	it's difficult to get the space just right you know
C	you need a lot don't you?
C	you need a lot of space
B	I think it's a shame that most of the china nowadays isn't made in
C	oh
B	it's home in Stoke-on-Trent
A	yeah
D	very nice that
A	asparagus soup
D	asparagus
A	mm
B	of course it's the very short English asparagus season at the moment
D	oh yes asparagus right I've got it now I've got it pictured
B	yes
D	it's like a green shoot isn't it?
A	yeah
C	mm
D	and it has a top on and
B	yes
D	and whatever thank you
B	and it's really nice when it comes into season the asparagus
C	mm mm
B	that's
C	never
B	it's
C	no I know it isn't no I know it isn't
B	er
D	have you grown it?
B	it's very hard to grow I haven't grown it now it takes two or three years before you can actually pick it
D	mm
C	oh right
B	but there is a erm a big asparagus farm in
D	right
B	yes
D	that's it
C	mm
B	it's supposed to be a very good vegetable in terms of nutrients
C	is it?
B	yes
C	mm
D	mm
B	I think it's nice to get the seasonal vegetables I think when something's in season there's there's a world of difference between
C	absolutely
B	a fruit from somewhere in the world that is sort of not really it's proper place I mean a classic example is strawberries
C	they're neither sweet nor soft
B	no
C	they're
D	you see when we were younger
C	well
D	and we were brought up on seasons but you know I mean just for example to have a salad like lettuce at Christmas
B	yes
C	mm
D	wow that was something
C	well no you could you couldn't get it could you?
D	no
C	it was like erm tomatoes
D	mm
C	and then they just used to come out didn't they?
D	mm
C	you used to buy about two at a time
C	didn't you?
D	mm
B	but what is amazing is we had bought English apples from
C	mm
B	it just shows you can nearly do the year
D	mm
C	mm
B	just
C	which I find mind you I know you eat a lot of fruit and we we don't eat so much but I find
B	yeah
C	mm
D	that's because they've been stored
C	and I think it's the way they're stored
D	in like some
B	mm
D	very controlled
C	chilled
D	and actually
C	mm
D	is what I'm getting at and they've been sort of er er
B	I think sometimes
D	animated condition like that
B	they get the the temperature just a bit too low
C	mm mm
B	and when we cut it it wasn't very good
D	no
C	no
D	inside they're soft it's as though the the sort of er once upon and time the fruit would start to get go bad from the outside outside in
B	mm
D	mm
C	mm nice
D	well I suppose in a way that's about the the er the fruit I eat
C	you like pears better than
D	mm
C	mm
D	I'll have er an orange er
C	excuse me
B	well they have distinct seasons oranges
D	yes
B	yes
D	but I was going to say that's because
B	yeah
D	easy to peel I don't mind oranges but I hate peeling them I really do and then when you've gone to all that trouble of peeling them
B	often it's the ugliest oranges that are the nicest
D	it's what?
B	the ugliest oranges the ones that are green and have got grey marks
D	yeah re they?
C	mm
D	yeah
C	and they were sort of erm peculiar shape and they had all bulges round they weren't smooth at all
D	mm hm
C	but they were you could eat them
B	the lemons?
C	no yes lemons you could eat them like an orange
C	yeah
B	yeah that's
C	you know they weren't bitter or anything
B	mm
C	but they were ugly you know they were really like erm all bumps round them weren't they? all rough skin
D	yes
B	mm
D	they they didn't look very appetising did they?
C	no they didn't no
B	no but Greek oranges are a bit like that
D	as you say yeah
C	mm

C	very nice
A	oh good
D	ugliest sort of thing are very often sweetest

C	no
C	we've got a new fish and chip shop
A	mm
B	I think they
C	mm
B	is it the
D	mm
B	I think they will probably do that
A	maybe

C	mm
A	I can't remember
C	yes it was
D	but I opened it up it went
C	well that's you ain't it?
C	ah
D	it got a laugh
C	well we went out the other day didn't we? we just erm
D	we did we had a martini
C	yes
A	mm
D	at er
A	excuse
C	excuse me yes sitting out on there
C	nice
A	and what time of day was that?
C	oh that was about three o'clock
A	oh really it's when the weakness starts setting in you know?
A	mm
C	we were going to have coffee and then we changed our minds didn't we?
D	mm
B	to tea?
C	no to martini
B	oh martini oh right
B	mm
A	mm
D	nice just sat there weren't it?
A	mm
C	well it's very countrified round there isn't it? you know
B	it is yes
C	you can just look out on the fields and that
B	I like looking out into the countryside
C	mm I do
B	yes
C	mm
D	without any
D	mm and these out at sea I showed you
B	mm
D	and er
B	mm
D	but not both
B	yes
B	mm
D	I forget whether it had or it hadn't
B	yes
D	and right there in the sea is there must have been about thirty wind farm you know
B	I know
D	mm
B	well we went to
C	mm
B	and in their sort of front room the drawing room er you could see wind turbines
C	could you?
B	yes and that's a listed building
C	yeah yeah
B	so I don't know what's happened there because generally wind turbines should not impact a listed building
D	mm hm
A	no that's true yeah
B	so obviously I'm not sure that enough weight has been attached
C	no
B	to the amenity
D	that that could be
C	mm
D	and we come to somewhere near
C	mm
D	eh they're really intimidating
B	mm
D	the road comes round and then you're going for them and then it just
C	there's about there's about fifteen isn't there?
B	yeah there was a lot yes
D	fifteen of them
B	yes
D	and they are they're
C	yeah
D	they're distracting to a driver
B	yes
C	yes
D	and they do distract you
B	you can't go affecting listed buildings
D	no
B	listed buildings are there for a reason
C	yes yeah
D	yeah
D	mm mm
B	yes
D	yeah
B	and er they've been restoring that
C	oh yes
D	mm
B	into a little hydroelectric plant I'll show you the pictures
D	is is it a watermill?
B	yes
D	yeah?
B	it's a real traditional watermill in actual stone
C	mm
B	it really looks good
D	going for his Ipad now
C	mm
D	it's er
C	got a bit of a headache
D	yeah twenty past one
C	mm
B	this is on the river
D	oh yes
B	mm
D	oh yes
B	yes
D	er with the wheel there
B	it is yes
D	water coming through here
B	mm
D	well
B	yes
D	just that one wheel?
B	just that one little wheel
D	did I tell you that er when we was cleaning well
B	yes
D	I came across this bike wheel with a dynamo in it
B	the recent oh the
C	doesn't it look beautiful
B	yes
C	yeah
B	yes
C	yes
B	fifty houses
A	what's that love?
B	the
C	that mill
A	oh yeah
C	mill
D	did did you go there
B	I've never been there no but it is in
D	no
B	yes
A	not far away is it?
B	no
C	mm we'll have to go another time
D	yeah
B	I I've been there there's supposed to be a footbridge that was part of the original design but erm they were hoping to try and restyle that as well
D	mm
C	mm
D	see that that would be worth a trip
B	mm yes it would be it's quite interesting yeah
D	it is we'll have to see if er
B	well I think that's much nicer than a wind turbine
D	oh I do mm
C	and I bet it has
B	mm yes I mean that's only a small little wheel that was intended to as a flour mill so it it's not
C	yes
D	I I say
B	that is a long time ago it's in the seventeen fifty-five
D	mm
C	yeah
D	that's some going ain't it?
A	mm
D	you know a watermill
A	yeah
D	and the thing is you can control it you see
B	mm
D	cos you can what they usually have on these rivers
B	yes
D	well further up they sort of widen it and have like a reservoir
B	yes
D	and from the reservoir the river comes
C	oh
B	mm
D	off the river comes another little river
B	yes they have a little diversion
D	that's it a diversion and they have er a a gate on it like a lock gate on it so if they don't want it they just shut the gate and the river continues
B	mm
D	but if they want to be er
A	grinding the flour
D	er jive that a bit and open that up and there we are
A	mm yes
D	and that and that can happen
B	I don't think the Derwent would freeze
D	not necessarily but
A	the Derwent won't but the baby river might freeze
D	yes yeah
D	and er
A	mm
D	he used water power but it didn't freeze up
B	mm
D	because it was a warm water
B	mm
D	er and there are these warm water springs
A	mm
B	yes
D	mm
B	mm
A	if it was the flour though you the harvest would be in say September so you'd be doing all your grinding in late September October by the time it's freezing
B	yeah
D	mm mm
A	November December you should have it all done hopefully
D	mm
A	erm I think that was later on
D	were they?
B	yes
D	mm I was gonna say the the bulbs wouldn't be out actually the first er house which had er electric lighting and that was er up in Scotland way I think
B	mm
A	mm
D	but but we certainly don't make enough use of er
B	no
D	water I mean when we've gone to to the Dales two or three times particularly with being on the coach and that
B	mm hm
D	have you seen
B	yes
D	you can see it's the power in it
A	you can hear it anyway
D	hear it thundering away there mm
C	yes
D	mm it's marvellous cos you see it's all running off the er moors and that
B	mm
D	and then er
B	yes
D	it peters down a bit a lovely picnic spot
B	mm mm
A	oh yeah
D	well
C	mm
D	because I heard on the wireless
C	mm
D	and it was saying where they were
A	yeah
B	mm
D	a working one
A	mm
D	you see? now that really interested me
A	mm surprised you didn't know about it anyway
C	mm
D	I didn't
C	mm
D	and behind the flour mill was a
A	really?
D	full of watercress all you know leaning cos it was running there and that
C	mm
D	I just forget what the the village was but there's a er
A	strangely yeah
D	mm
A	mm
B	mm
D	he says and you know there's something on it
A	bank
D	in the bank he says yes I was the bank manager
D	how about that eh? I was the bank manager he said
C	mm
D	mm
C	I managed it
D	he said er
D	so that was it so he went
C	well she never liked computers did she
D	no oh no
C	she liked the books and writing in them and
A	the big ledgers
C	yes
A	you know where you are
D	the proper way yeah
C	yeah she never got used to it I don't think
D	no no no
D	we're only in
D	no no she could not face that but er if he could go and he went and booked in the hotel as well
C	make it bearable
D	mm it's really funny though when you think about it if you knew them like
B	mm
D	but anyhow that was that mm
C	mm
D	and it must be in a way the start
B	mm
D	it goes round there fresh water in that and you had to be careful cos you could tell the ground was getting a little bit unsure
A	squidgy mm
D	and you looked up there and there was this biggest like half a field and the water's bubbling up out of there it's a it's a spring
A	mm
D	mm
A	like that no
D	it's like that
B	mm
D	I mean I've been to
A	mm bubbling out
D	not bubbling out the
B	mm
D	so that river we saw at
A	mm
D	and it was you know it was a good one clean
B	mm
D	I I bet you could have almost eaten the
A	watercress
D	watercress out of there
A	mm
D	but
A	mm
D	don't you only buy like er cultivated watercress because of the chemicals and that further up
A	mm you don't know who's been put in
D	no
C	they would have eaten it in the past though wouldn't they?
D	mm?
C	they would have eaten it in the past
A	yes they would
D	oh yes
A	but there might not have the factories putting the chemicals in
D	wouldn't have been
C	yeah it would've been fresh wouldn't it? yeah
B	true
C	there's a lot of rapeseed on the way here
D	mm
C	field and fields of it
A	I know
C	mm
D	it must be one of the easiest of crops
C	mm
D	and the most er
B	lucrative
C	yes lucrative yes
D	valuable you know for money wise
C	yeah that's what we said
D	a cash crop
A	yeah
D	er too and I think they must get two crops a year there always seems to be field
A	yes
B	it's not supposed to be very good for the bees it's like
C	oh is it not?
B	human's having a a Big Mac it's
C	oh
A	junk food for bees
B	it's sort of very fatty and junk food for them
C	oh right yeah
A	it does spoil the honey though because it makes it all erm runny
B	yes
C	oh does it?
A	mm I think so
C	oh right
A	when I get rapeseed honey it's really watery
C	oh yeah
A	and pale
C	yes
D	so is that altering the ecology of of like the bees?
C	so which is the best the clover?
A	erm yeah there's heather honey isn't there?
D	is it altering the the bees?
C	yeah
B	well it's
A	spring
C	mm
B	I think it's
D	mm
C	is that Manuka
A	Manuka
C	is that any different? does that taste different?
A	yeah it's quite strong strong flavour
C	oh is it? yes I've never tasted it
A	yeah
C	just thought it might be good for you that
A	yeah it's supposed to be really good isn't it?
C	yeah
A	I've
C	yeah yeah
B	I think some of the nicest honey's tend to be mountain honey
C	oh is it?
B	pine
C	pine? oh right
B	erm sort of field and forest
D	heather
A	lavender mm
B	heather yes heather
C	mm
D	mm you see these people who get the hives up on some of those moors
B	mm
D	they they'll just be in the heather won't they?
A	mm
D	that's it
B	mm yes
A	orange blossom honey
C	mm that's nice yeah
D	mind you there's that er
A	oh the royal jelly?
D	the royal jelly that's it
A	mm
D	royal jelly have you
A	mm
D	know anything about that or? how does that come about or?
A	not sure
