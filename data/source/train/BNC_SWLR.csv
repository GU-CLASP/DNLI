B	just as long as we get there in time
A	that's why er I think we'll go the fast way
B	which way's
A	he's going the way he knows past
B	he said he said
A	no I think that's there as well
B	the main thing is just to relax because er
A	yeah
B	it
A	right
B	to get the those two amps up the stairs right?
A	ah right it's just like playing for mass?
B	it is really they do a tuning up and stuff like that
A	well the thing is they can easily wait it's not like you've got a registry office spot is it? it's less pressure
B	yeah
A	cos they are already married there's no registrar there
B	ah
A	there's no signing in of the register
B	oh I see right
A	they just went and did that on their own and this is their wedding celebration
B	so what's this then? they're just doing their vows?
A	this er they they they only went for a small official service to the registry office just before we met them they'd done it two weeks before that or something
B	right
A	so that they didn't wanna be bothered with all the official stuff at their wedding
B	okay
A	they
B	er so there there won't be a minister or a
A	no that might fall
B	yeah that's
A	I thought the rain would be worse
A	see how clear that is? I'd rather follow that than try a different route
B	the sat nav?
A	I'd rather follow the sat nav than try a different route even if the other route was gonna be shorter what would you rather do?
B	I
A	but you're a navigator
B	no I'm the guitarist
A	no you're the navigator as well
B	well do you want me to have a look on the atlas?
A	no cos we know the two routes it's just which one do we take? the easy one following the sat nav
B	if if you kept on going right? and disobeyed the sat nav
B	and went to
A	yeah yeah
B	the only thing is
A	it would take longer
B	yeah as I that's what I'm saying
A	yeah
B	because er often people who take as I have done in the past it doesn't end up being shorter does it?
A	no
B	just take shorter in miles but longer in time
A	yeah well that's what
B	yeah
A	evidently it flares up the further south you get
B	yeah
A	so
B	I mean I
A	oh at the end of the service? yeah
B	you know when they're signing the book or
A	no there's no book to sign
B	oh well whatever they do
A	I think they will want music even
B	yeah
B	we've got the music it's not a problem
A	they they've designed their own service so they must be creative
B	they are aren't they?
A	yes they're quite
B	I tell you I know what we'll do
A	have you brought the Thomas Hardy?
B	I've got all the poems and stuff yeah
A	have you got the Thomas Hardy though? cos he wants literature and he liked that
B	oh yeah
B	oh yeah I know what we'll do we'll tell them I'll just start inventing
A	oh yeah
B	the origins of these dances cos no one knows you know waulking songs?
A	yeah
B	W A U L K I N G
A	yeah
B	in Scotland they did them everywhere like
A	yeah
B	one of the main ones was when they dyed yarn and all of that in urine
A	oh yeah
B	to preserve it
A	yeah
B	so I'll say this is reciprocating the
A	yeah
B	yeah do you want some of this can before I have a go?
A	no thanks yeah
B	I mean they sounded
A	it's really good if you can do those poems cos it just lets me find the next dance get the
B	yeah
A	gives
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	physically demanding for him
B	I've got one by Pablo Neruda
A	oh good idea yeah
B	I've got one by er John Agard it's quite nice
A	what's that one?
B	it's er something like let your love be a river you know that kind of stuff
A	oh right
B	there was a Guardian thing where it had they asked modern poets to er write verses about
A	they've probably I bet there's one they've chosen at least from yours
B	no cos I avoided the search Google search for wedding
A	ah very clever
B	I went into another one just
A	very clever
B	I knew that would be a bit
A	having said that
B	there's a heron
A	having said that oh yeah
B	that was amazing wasn't it?
A	having said that I think they would quite like the ones they've chosen for the evening guests
B	do we know how many guests there are?
A	no they weren't sure at the time were they?
B	are we dealing in what? a hundred? or two hundred?
A	I
B	right yeah it's a lot isn't it?
A	yeah it is quite a lot
B	how many were at
A	er about that
B	hundred and fifty
A	about that yeah
B	right
A	but a lot of hers have just come to sit down haven't they?
B	do you want
A	no thanks I'm guessing they'll have
B	yeah
A	but for the very start it would be nice cos I think there'll be a lot of people for the first dance that's why I'm thinking if we get them into the middle for Circassian Circle we can even have a circle round a circle round a circle we could fit everybody in if they were careful when they go into the middle
B	what is that dance? is it quite simple?
A	that's the simplest
B	ah good idea to start with it then
A	yeah
B	I was thinking maybe why not get them in the circle to start off with?
A	oh right yeah cos
B	do you without telling them that er just gather round the couple you know
A	gather round
A	they might be anyway
B	cos do you remember the chimney sweep used to say?
A	yeah
B	he didn't you know you'll never walk alone with everyone in the middle
A	yeah I remember
B	yeah
A	they're not quite
B	say it again?
B	right
A	because we offered readings and she liked the aspect of it being
B	yeah
A	about the
B	which one?
A	the
B	er I don't know it's about
A	I thought it was keep right up here
B	so you put this you put this venue into that sat nav?
A	hang on
B	bear in the right lane I think you have to be
B	oh we're alright we're in the south yeah no that's alright yeah
A	oh
B	yeah
A	it's supposed to be brighter it's darker down here look at it
B	there's a copper don't be speeding
A	I'm not speeding I'm not even up to seventy
B	I'd love to do one of these events where people aren't panicking all the time
A	who's panicking?
B	well about getting there on time or about erm
A	yeah that's why the
B	we have indeed
A	that'll be fantastic
B	my only thing about the
A	this'll be a hard this'll be a hard floor as well do I get over in the other lane?
B	yeah you join it
A	I don't know what you mean
B	well you said a hard floor it might be there might be wooden floors but the ceiling's laced with
A	oh I see
B	ceilings'll be laced with asbestos
A	yeah
B	well
B	that's obviously why
A	no she thought we'd cave in
B	yeah
A	poor isn't it? I think it is brightening up though I thought it was getting darker but
B	yeah
A	it is brightening up a bit
B	yeah I wonder if I should write a poem for them
A	oh that would be nice
B	yeah
A	aren't they leaving the mill behind?
B	they are leaving the mill behind just
B	her dad leased it before
A	yeah
B	so this is probably a bit of a wrench isn't it? in that respect
A	yeah they obviously want to have one last celebration in it
B	I should've just taken the those poems
A	have you still got them?
B	they're quite sort of simple aren't they? really
A	well
B	d√©coupage
A	did you keep it?
B	no
A	oh that's alright then
B	no
A	I bet it's lovely
B	do they what kind of
A	yarns
B	is a yarn wool?
A	I think they've got threads and
B	yeah
A	keep keep looking for me
B	I am love is like the life of wool
A	oh that's nice
B	it's it begins in mystery how about that?
A	love begins in mystery
B	love is like the life of wool
A	yeah
B	it begins far away
B	in mystery
B	sheep
A	yeah cos they're they're erm they're just near the moors aren't they?
B	sheep startled on the moors leave a fibre of life on the brambles
A	the beginning was nice just tone it down a bit
B	love is like the life of wool it begins far away in mystery sheep
A	mist and mystery might be nice cos there was
B	well hold on sheep
B	sheep startled on the misty moors
A	ah
B	far away in mystery sheep startled on the misty moors
[ANNOTATION]	You can make an analogy between love and wool.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	a startle of sheep on the misty moors leaves behind right
B	a startle of sheep
A	yeah?
B	leaves behind the dream of a garment
A	oh yes that's better much better you don't wanna be talking about embryos
B	leaves behind the dream of a garment erm
A	no you put it on the erm
[ANNOTATION]	Love begins in trust and security, not in mystery.	Contradiction
B	ah a carder
A	is that what they call it?
B	yeah
A	you've got the right ideas
B	yeah that sort of thing
A	just get the ideas down for now
B	I'll do er I'll do it later when we're
[ANNOTATION]	They are not going to do it at the moment, but later.	Entailment
A	well why don't you write some
B	well it's just gonna be the
A	the journey of the wool
B	yeah
A	so that's what I'm thinking so what do they do with the yarn on that erm?
B	they card it that's why you get wool carder bees
A	yes yes
[ANNOTATION]	You card the yarn to get wool.	Entailment
B	carding then you preserve it in urine but we'll leave that bit out
A	leave that bit out
B	carding tenterhooks
A	yeah
B	isn't that when they stretch it? leaves you on
[ANNOTATION]	They are going to include the bit about pee.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	They are going to include the bit about pee.	Contradiction
A	yeah stretching on tenterhooks
B	love can leave you on tenterhooks
A	ah
B	well
A	oh I told you it would drop off there
B	no er I moved it
A	oh
B	that's really loud yeah er tenterhooks I'll just do something really simple if I can get it down then it'll be a nice touch just to hand it to them
A	yeah journey in wool well after that the stretching can you remember the ladies in the
B	eh
A	weaving
B	weaving
A	yeah
B	in each in each garment
B	yeah that's the trouble isn't it?
A	we're going all the way to the M62
B	so
A	if you look at that it'll tell you
B	what
A	yeah
B	when are we gonna find out about Jeremy Corbyn?
A	eleven o'clock
B	oh god it's gonna be amazing isn't it?
B	and it's taking place
A	we're on the A1 now
B	right we should follow this one for two
A	for how long?
B	thirty-four point two miles into the journey
A	see if you were going to
B	that's the way
A	they're going that way but I think we'll carry on
B	can't we get
A	yeah that would be better
B	right so
A	if you if you if I know the next step of each bit it helps
B	yeah okay we keep right to the fork onto the M1
A	oh just go back a bit
B	following the sign
A	just go back a bit just I'm on the A1 now
B	yeah you should follow the A1M
A	to for how long?
B	three thirty-four point two miles
A	how long do you think I've been on it?
B	oh not long not that long
A	ten miles? twenty miles?
B	twenty miles
A	have I?
B	then then you follow the A1 then you keep right to the fork onto the M1 you follow the sign for M1
A	right that'll do for now and then
B	there will have been similar ones before to get you ready
B	do you remember? like there's two or three miles of them
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah is this
A	that's
B	then we're on that for ten miles
B	then you come off at junction forty-two for
A	yeah
B	er can you believe
A	yeah cos do you remember when we went to that Ikea? it was nearly in
B	I didn't go
A	you did just
B	so you could get to
A	yeah
B	but who would in their right mind go to
B	I like the picture of
A	pictures pictures of the road signs
B	the pictures
A	how's he got those?
B	I don't know
A	whatever that is RAC or AA
B	I don't know how much to go on about you know we usually say these are the dances that people living round here would've had? you could spin a story about
A	spin spinning's a good word spinning
B	about how the people probably left places like er
B	and with their dances and ended up in this mill like working with their children
A	oh yes I'm sure they did I'm sure they had dances in the mill yeah
B	I I just don't know what the politics of the mill
A	what's that got to do with
B	well if you're up if they're like rank Tories they don't wanna be reminded of er
A	no er you're just reminding me of the Thomas Hardy
B	oh right
A	the people who would've loved you know to celebrate it
B	you mean this was all that remained of the fresh air
B	gusting through their hair
A	to be honest I think they're just like er
B	yeah
A	crafts and yarns and stuff
B	yeah I mean they must be quite entrepreneurial to make it work cos it sounds
B	arts and crafts you know is a massive market isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
B	people like
A	does she?
B	yeah
A	that's not arts and crafts she just collects egg cups
B	it's similar
A	no it's not
B	it's it's the same sort of like
A	no
B	department in the store
A	no no no no not at all
B	yeah if you've got a bunny rabbit egg cup then you're playing on the same team as people who make like
A	no not at all
B	cottages out of wool don't you think?
A	no some are collectors and some create things from the raw materials
B	so remember we're looking for er
A	M1
B	the sign for M1 onto the M1 you follow the sign for M1
A	glad it
B	it is a bit yeah are we still not out of
B	is it? that says
B	I think you get loads of loads of reminders
B	yeah
B	what? at four o'clock?
A	really leisurely meal well anytime I would love to go to a
B	well they're supposed to be the best aren't they? obviously it's the capital
A	I remember
B	talking about him
A	have they?
B	they're not even in the Super League
B	what do you think
A	I would love
B	yeah
A	to get set up
B	twenty-four hour Greggs
A	and just chill
B	I think we can do that
A	well I've found some jobs that I can do and I think it's always good if you pack the cars the same way and do the same jobs
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	before you get into this business you have no idea how much of a pain it is
A	well that's er
B	with the equipment
A	yeah it's the roadie side isn't it?
B	yeah
A	the the the problem is
B	he likes driving I don't know
A	no he likes being part of it
B	well where is he today?
B	yeah
A	oh so we might be near our thirty mile thing
B	yeah I think so yeah not far off it
A	oh right are we switching the er thing off and putting the radio on at eleven or what?
B	yeah
B	that would be that would be lovely wouldn't it?
A	that would be fantastic that's why it'd be good to get half seven start is it half seven
B	yeah
A	and then quarter past eight till nine o'clock
B	yeah but
A	so that's just the usual
B	they probably won't wanna stay up all night themselves
A	they'll be tired
B	she said she's got some sort of basic system upstairs where they can put music through
A	yes just normal microphones upstairs
B	you you got the first one yeah? A1 follow the A1
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	follow the sign for M1
A	yes I'm in the right lane aren't I?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	why is that sat nav not talking to me?
B	I don't know
A	you keep your eye on that bit of paper there
B	she should be shouldn't she?
B	did we switch her off when we put the volume up?
A	no
B	it might pipe up in a minute or so
A	I thought she'd say continue on the blah blah blah
B	yeah you'd expect her to
A	I might need to get a little sat nav to put on my
B	yeah why don't you?
A	cos you can see the map as well can't you?
B	no idea
A	it's just er I always thought I'd wait till they were under fifty quid
B	I think they are yeah
A	I saw one for sixty-eight not paying that
B	aye
B	I'm gonna er
A	I don't really want one for my birthday because I'd rather have clothes
B	yeah
A	that I need for school
B	well let's hope the Marks and Sparks scenario plays out
A	that's what I was wondering if we knew that was definitely happening
B	can't rely on it
A	can't rely on it can you?
B	I think once we've started a precedent it'd be cruel
B	yeah er
A	she's gone to sleep
B	what should I do?
A	have er have a look
B	it says one point eight miles until you change
A	oh right well just keep your eye on it
B	don't know sat navs might be a bit of a mixed blessing
A	well he's been on the UK roads for decades hasn't he?
B	this one's silent
B	shall I try and get the volume back?
A	yeah you might as well but don't get the picture off cos at least you can look at it
B	no I don't know
A	do we look as if we're still alright?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	keep right
A	ah she just tells you literally just before
B	in half a mile well that's plenty of time isn't it?
A	that's alright yeah
B	couldn't you get like someone
B	couldn't I was just thinking it'd be great to have
A	what did she say?
B	keep right
A	oh well that that
B	that's it
A	yeah
B	right okay
A	still
B	yeah
B	nine minutes to junction forty-two that's the one we're coming off at
B	well it'll be signed
A	so I just follow
B	you follow the M1 this one for ten minutes until at junction forty-two you exit onto the M62 following signs for
A	right
B	then you're on that one for ten miles
A	right
B	I think it's the one everyone gets off at
A	yes I know but it's whether you go east or west I I go as you get to it it's which way do you go on it?
A	what?
A	yeah
B	who who is it?
A	when we got a taxi once he said who would you like? we got erm Basil Fawlty
A	that was funny
B	did you not get Elvis or anything like that?
A	well he was dead he couldn't do them could he?
B	no but there's a bloke in Memphis who sounds exactly like him
A	oh an impersonator?
B	well not an impersonator just by some chance he's got the same vocal chords and everything
A	oh well he should offer to do it put your pound in a jar
B	I think I have haven't I?
A	loads of people would buy that
B	god you're right
B	cos it was an internet thing people saying have you heard this guy?
A	well if even if he can't sing you've got him a job
A	is that speaking? or singing? or what?
B	speaking
A	what number was it? forty-two?
B	yeah
A	the junction?
B	yeah junction number forty-two
A	what number's this one?
B	forty-six
A	oh oh we'll take this
A	are we getting paid for petrol?
B	yeah
A	are we?
B	yeah
A	is the cheque payable to
B	cash I've asked for
A	he can earn loads can't he?
B	oh I've just heard it's been cancelled didn't happen
A	I bet the result comes on the radio soon
B	shall I er?
A	how much have we got to go?
B	erm the
A	oh right
A	do you know how old
B	forty-five
A	fifty
B	is she?
A	yeah
B	you would never of I would never of thought that
A	no I didn't realise
B	mind you poor
A	yeah
B	she's just
A	she's
B	worries about everything
A	she does
B	don't know
B	yeah it's awful isn't it?
A	horrible it's like
B	this is the
A	yeah
B	you hear you can hear this four or five miles away
A	oh you will
B	on a quiet day
A	here we are M62
B	yeah
B	you don't want
B	it's junction forty-two
A	is that right?
B	yeah
A	right so which way's east and which way's west?
A	west is over there so I'm gonna go
B	I don't know
A	no south west east
B	well I don't know where the magnetic north is from here
A	well we're heading south aren't we?
B	are we?
A	yeah yeah
B	right
A	oh he will
B	yeah
A	oh yeah er it's a slip road off that's alright
B	you've still got three point nine miles three point eight miles
A	that was number forty-five
B	yeah
A	next junction
B	what?
A	oh right I seem to remember her having her fortieth
B	no
B	yeah?
A	than can you remember when we came back from
B	but this is beginning to seem long as well
A	I remember that one seemed very long
B	this one's quicker just in terms of
A	yeah
B	speed and less stress is it?
A	it's easier to see
B	is it easier to drive it?
A	I think it is
B	I just could never drive you know thinking about it I just dunno how you do it
B	always
A	good
B	I'd just been thinking
B	well yeah that's the trouble it would be stressful
A	it is it is in bad weather I must admit
B	and there's the
A	it's what?
B	well they've got stuff in
B	yeah
B	junction forty-two exit onto the M62 following signs for
A	at least I'm in the right lane anyway
B	so when we come to that junction forty-two
A	it'll be like loads of cars meeting at this point
B	this is the one
A	yeah this is it
B	five hundred and fifty yards
A	which way did I say was west? that way?
B	I don't know
A	north south no that way I'm trying to guess which direction
B	no you won't be able to
B	we're joining another sewer outflow of traffic
A	this
B	yeah
A	coming from all over the place
A	it's where north south meets west east isn't it?
A	that says roadworks
B	it's not now
A	that said roadworks
B	yeah with a date
A	just keep your eye on the signs
B	oh god welcome to our work zone you don't want that sort of sign though do you?
A	no
B	right at what?
A	the fork she's she's very good telling me in advance
B	oh
A	see how she keeps telling me?
B	yeah
A	I am right at the fork
B	that's it
A	that's it that's all I was worried about getting on the wrong one
B	ten miles
A	ten miles
B	it's eleven thirty the Corbyn thing though isn't it? not eleven
A	I thought it was eleven
A	just try and let me concentrate
B	yeah
B	this reminds me of
A	ah
B	a huge tunnel yeah
B	absolutely beautiful
B	who would've thought it would place like that would exist
B	in
A	that won't be long
B	er then the signs you follow this time are for
A	oh
B	oh you should've
A	talk about
B	right
B	signs you follow this time
B	it's quite tricky
A	she'll that's why I want the
B	yeah yeah
B	that's right
A	mm?
A	oh put Corbyn on yeah
