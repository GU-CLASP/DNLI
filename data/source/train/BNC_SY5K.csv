A	okay is that recording now? or is it doing something?
A	yes
A	okay so right
B	are you gonna do that thing first? do you have to do that first?
A	what thing?
B	the taping thing
A	no
B	oh
A	well no we just tape it
B	oh right
A	we just tape yeah just tape the conversation
B	oh okay
A	yes
B	I'm alright I can do it I can work that one out yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah that's fine
A	ordinary conversation
B	yeah
A	and er you said something about a rationale for choosing a particular area
B	I did so we'll talk about that
A	and then erm but then I said in my interview
B	yeah yeah
A	health commissioners to see
B	yeah
A	it kind of fits in logically with
B	yeah
A	so
B	I did
A	mm
B	I think we'll always say for the cottage hospice business case
A	mm mm
B	because not enough people in the organisation
A	mm mm
B	and and the document itself
A	mm mm
B	not enough staff know the business plan well enough
A	mm
B	so if we
A	mm mm
B	I think that
A	oh right
B	yeah so
A	okay so
B	to avoid them talking about the business plan for the cottage hospices cos they'll get mixed up
A	okay
B	business plan that right? so in respect of the business case which is what we'd said in that thing about the business case for cottage hospices
A	mm mm
B	erm in fact my fixation on language cos I wrote a few times didn't I? a full and fully costed kind of business case
A	yes that was scary
B	er it was quite
A	mm mm
B	and
A	mm mm
B	and see how it goes and run it for a while
A	mm mm
B	and learn the lessons from it before we try to go for a second one but I think there will be a second one
A	okay
B	er but we won't know that until we've had the first one for a while and there may be a third one but we won't know about that until we've had the second one for a while
A	okay
B	so the business case erm a big part of it will be location I don't think there's any doubt about that and my
A	mm mm
B	rationale in suggesting that it should be
A	mm
B	I think I said
A	mm mm
B	because
A	mm mm
B	to a shift which means that GPs and others might not want to refer to hospice in
A	oh I see right
B	but
A	no that's fine
B	eighty percent
A	oh right
A	right gosh
B	we were kind of cross subsidising if you see what I mean
A	yeah
B	we were raising our money in
A	yeah
B	and so erm I worry that the maps you know maps in my humble opinion are just lines drawn on a piece of paper
A	yeah
B	they're arbitrary
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	the fact that the vast majority of people we see we see in their homes they can see us around this building
A	yeah
B	and so that's why I've thought since I got here that we should do something and put a bricks and mortar facility in
A	cos they come here
B	because they come here cos they go shopping to
A	yeah and there's an easy road
B	erm
A	or an easy route
B	exactly and and also then the
A	yeah
B	and you start getting into so this this is er an older erm erm map about and we're not on it if you see what I mean this is
A	no I've been looking for you mm
B	yeah where where where where my little pencil we can we can find these again but if you see my little pencil mark is where we cover in the
A	yeah
B	and this just happens to be the commissioning groups within
A	mm
B	west and east
A	yeah
B	and so I'm only interested I personally am only interested in in east
A	mm mm
B	and the loss of a strategic health authority and therefore a strategic picture and the government push to localism whatever that means
A	mm
B	I I I I I know I go off at tangents actually that one of the things about the
A	mm
B	about the routes that where people live and where they see themselves belonging to you know the committee development stuff that you know this village or this community ends at that river or that scout hut if you're the other side of the scout hut then you're not part of blah you
A	right
B	used to be
A	mm
B	the
A	oh I see
B	and I just
A	mm
B	then some of their political small piece strategy is to run their health economy by limiting the amount of people that are referred to an acute trust cos they've got three hospice hospitals sorry three cottage hospitals and the GPs would like not to send people to hospital
A	right
B	because it costs them a lot of money so they're trying to run their health economy based on the three cottage hospitals which which will have flaws and problems for the people that live there and so I want to make sure that we as the hospice have some presence there cos I
A	mm
B	worry that one that of the
A	mm
B	about why in the main I think we should try the first cottage hospice in
A	yes and
B	it's interesting that I can't really have that conversation meaningfully
B	with the trustees
A	yeah
B	end up with unintended consequences
A	yes
B	sorry I stopped you you were gonna say something
A	no no no no that's fine erm
B	er in
A	okay
B	so this is the whole of
A	okay
B	and the one that we cover most is this
A	yes
B	and here is the population of of the erm the the CCGs which with
A	yes
B	er the health and social care bill
A	yes
B	and there is an argument some people think that they're gonna end up merging cos they think some of these populations are no big enough to get the economies of scale that
A	mm
B	that the CCGs need
A	yes
B	and when I think this this one
A	yeah
B	it is but it's a unitary as well so actually
A	yeah so it'll it'll yeah they'll declare
A	mm
B	these three CCGs for
A	mm
B	are doing lots of things together so they have one joint newsletter
A	oh
B	and erm and they they and the the economies of the economies of scale for CCGs one of the really main players that's invisible
A	right
B	and there's a big paper about commissioning support units that's come out of government commissioning support units are supposed to make the economies of scale so these CCGs aren't big enough to commission
A	no oh
B	and so the
A	er
B	and so really that's another restructuring by the back door which is putting PCTs and strategic
A	right
B	so erm
A	so these the faceless bureaucrats will be back
B	they are still there and they've not really left so the chief exec of the commissioning support unit for what was
A	mm
B	which now covers all of this cos it's now
A	oh does it?
A	promotion
B	are the same people that went through the revolving door and took their two hundred and fifty thousand pounds redundancy and have popped up again as the chief exec of whatever and as they try separate off commissioning also the deliverers are the same in the sense that if we take the
A	mm mm
B	the chief exec
A	mm mm
B	my choice of cottage hospice again this is all about my choice of cottage hospice being in
A	oh right
B	and has pushed out its thirteen million pounds community contract to any bidder so Virgin Healthcare could bid and be delivering that in
A	mm mm?
B	and what was
A	oh really?
B	so the internal market for the NHS as well as the external market makes a really uncertain time
A	wow
B	hence me wanting my cottage hospice here for the future for the people that live there
A	yes yes
B	yes and and particularly because that contracts out
A	yeah
B	and people are bidding in and they won't let the contract till next October by which time I'm hoping to have broken ground and say to the new provider by the way chaps we have this new cottage hospice just opening
A	yeah and is it now
B	in the
A	mm?
B	yeah?
B	so if I was to erm I can draw on this you can have this map if
A	yeah
B	they they're putting out
A	mm
B	arguably there are six hospices which have a bit of service into that community thing
A	right
B	so we've tried to talk as hospices
A	are you that scribble?
B	yeah we're that scribble
A	okay
B	erm
A	mm mm
A	yeah
B	that kind of service
A	yeah
B	and get money six six hospices from that CCG
A	mm
B	but they all get
A	oh right
B	but the truth is that this is brand new to us as hospices they don't I believe they don't understand what consortium means actually this is back to SRB or or or lottery or you know
A	mm
B	and we can all have a seat at that big table they don't realise that that consortium will mean subcontracting effectively
A	mm
B	but they have found out that the money that's given to hospices three hundred and eighty-five thousand pounds is not part of the thirteen million pounds so they think everything's okay now but the truth is we have to work with that provider because that is the provider that will refer into hospice services so
A	yeah
B	actually I have had some negotiations with
A	yeah
B	the current provider is called
A	right
B	so all of this means this is the place to go I have no doubt that if we're gonna open a cottage hospice this is the place to go
A	right
B	it has no acute trust hospital it is fed by cottage hospitals
A	ah
B	and actually it is the place this is the most dangerous for us strategically of losing if something happens
A	mm mm
B	and therefore the patients themselves would struggle and lose out
A	mm mm
B	er and cos it's just new maps and new
A	okay
B	I have floated that idea with the CCG at our meeting who thought it was very interesting and would like to speak more
A	say that last bit again what? you floated?
B	I have floated the idea of our cottage hospice idea with this CCG
A	mm
B	and they're very interested in it and would like to know more the thing is I need to get past the gatekeepers the decision makers
A	yeah
B	but it kind of makes sense to them because it makes sense to them cos they're trying to run a health economy with just cottage hospitals
A	yeah
B	so the cottage hospice concept fits into their construct of what they see
A	yeah
B	as secondary care
A	right
B	there's another level of there about why to have it there cos what I don't want to happen is the cottage hospitals to go for palliative care in a big way cos they would be a major threat to us
A	mm?
B	and they what they're trying to do with the palliative care funding review is find a per patient tariff for the government
A	ah right
B	to say what should the state do for palliative care patients?
A	right
B	and how do we fund that? so for three or four years they've been trying to pull together this palliative care funding review they had massive consultations they produced various documents they had a final document government were committed to it at the time that's the coalition they did eleven pilot sites to try and work out how the tariff and the currency would work
A	mm mm
B	they've
A	mm
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	as they get foundation status it gives
A	yeah
B	them far more freedom to behave like a private sector hospital
A	yeah
B	which is another reason that this CCG doesn't want them as part of their picture cos they're going to charge more money and do things
A	right
B	and they could also do by opening palliative care wards if there's money in it they would take that money which'd be another threat to the million pound statutory funding that we do that
B	it's just over the boundary
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	erm about the foundation status thing but that's in Kent and it's less of a risk I think than here but it is one of the reasons that this CCG is going for a very community based approach
A	right
B	in what it wants to do that's why it's gonna commission community services thirteen million pounds and part of that contract makes them use the cottage hospitals that are in that patch
A	mm
B	but what I wouldn't want to happen is if those cottage hospitals started effectively becoming mini hospices
A	yeah
B	don't want them to find the role of our palliative care and de facto hospices
A	yeah
B	they're also they're not very good at it usually
A	well
B	yeah
A	they don't do it
B	yeah
A	don't er that's not the skills they have so erm
B	but that won't stop the CCG trying to get them to do it if the palliative care funding review makes a revenue income string for them
A	well they're going to chase the money aren't they?
B	they're going to chase the money absolutely
A	like everybody does
B	and the foundation trust might also chase the money but they're less likely to change the money because they
A	yeah
B	chase the money cos they've got such a massive area to cover
A	yeah
B	and if you want to go further with some of this if we if I go back to the Kent bit of it
A	yeah
B	so this
A	mm mm
B	cos it's both actually it's
A	mm mm
B	and so they have two hospital sites one at
A	mm mm
B	which is another reason that I'm okay within that patch really it's another reason I don't need to open the first one here I need the second one to be here I think because we're we get most of eighty percent of our patients eighty percent of our money and we understand
A	oh god who's building it?
B	it's been built and I don't know who's built it I think it might be er er er I don't know who the private hospital is but it's brand new
A	mm so somebody's got
B	yes throw the money at
B	yes yes
A	mm
B	if there's those levels of complexity and there's another level of complexity if I talk about the five to ten years thing and if I think beyond ten years I think that
A	right
B	the merging of health and social care will have to happen
A	yes yeah
B	and actually it won't be the health economy and the acute trusts and the cottage hospitals that will be our main worry partner whatever it will be county councils
A	mm
B	because the health and social care and the Dilnot report and everything will have to be addressed by
A	yeah
B	so the demographic is more elderly frail people and so that means they get more cancers and
A	mm
B	for elderly frail people and I think that the partner in that will be county councils
A	mm
B	not not the NHS as we know it and therefore health and well-being boards if they continue depending who gets in when the government changes
A	yeah well no they've got to it's it does it's ludicrous
B	yeah
A	okay so and erm
B	mm?
A	as far as that's concerned this picture you're painting here
B	yeah
A	you're you're confident enough enough enough about it to
B	yeah
A	he backed a
B	the
A	yeah
B	hunch yeah yeah
A	is right?
B	I've thought since I got here that cos that was the cusp of the Act the Health And Social Care Act
A	mm mm
B	it's this part of this patch
A	yeah
B	that this has always been a danger for us because it could
A	right
B	and and therefore they could do that at
A	yeah and actually some are already doing that aren't they? so that
B	yeah
A	where is it? where they've already said no you can't have choice any more
B	yes
A	where you go
B	and so my worry is
A	yes
B	and if you stop the referral routes by GPs then we then people wouldn't get wouldn't get referred into this hospice
A	I always thought that people self-referrals to hospices
B	we've we've only just introduced self-referral
A	really?
B	we we
A	I thought I thought you elected to
B	no
A	I thought you sort you said oh well you know I'd like to go to the hospice please and they said yes fine
B	well that would
A	and off you trotted
B	that would be good if that's the case
A	uhu
B	we're trying to break that cycle and we've been trying for a while to break that cycle and we will take self-referrals in fact in the last few months we've put a self-referral button on the website and we'll take phone self-referral but in some respects that's a con because they're not self-referrals because we still then have to go back to the
A	right
B	Mrs Smith would like to be referred here can we have a conversation about this please so we have our
A	so the GPs have to consent?
B	they have to have the consent and mainly main referrals come from GPs cos that conversation should be had with GPs
A	mm
B	there's part of the
A	mm
B	fact
A	mm
B	so we know that one percent of our population
A	mm
B	we know we don't need to see all of them but we do know that actually between sixty odd percent and eighty percent let's say yeah we should be seeing and we're not seeing that so our big quest of of our business plan is to have a forty-five percent increase so at the currently we see about eleven hundred new referrals each and every year and we intend by the end of the business plan period be seeing sixteen hundred new referrals each and every year which is another reason to build some bed capacity in
A	mm
B	which is stepdown bed stuff so it does fit
A	yeah
B	together my
A	yeah
B	my things so
A	yeah
B	I'm pretty confident that that would be the first place to go
A	okay
B	it's it's a complex picture and argument to make isn't it?
A	it is
B	to the uninitiated
A	it is rather
B	yeah yeah
A	oh yes mm so so the sort of area you're looking at is sort of
B	yes
A	the top half of that
B	yes
A	oh right
B	er and we serve these GP practices up here by and large
A	yeah
B	and we will certainly need to get the figures from the GP practices cos it's GP practices which erm
A	mm mm
B	cos erm it we'll get the same thing if this map showed
A	oh right
B	and so when you get if you took if that was
A	mm
B	relationship with
A	yeah I know I was
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	etcetera etcetera so I I'm pretty confident that that's the big strategic solution we need to solve
A	yeah
B	because of the worries of unintended consequences of changes
A	yeah well it's already the case in London
B	yeah yeah
A	next door
B	yeah and
A	we you didn't didn't use to have
B	ultimately we think we should be about patient choice if they want to come to us and be under our care then that should be their prerogative really
A	yeah no absolutely
A	no well that's what people expect as well
B	mm
A	okay so and your name is known round there as well already so you've
B	yeah yeah I
A	shops and things like that
B	I think that erm the
A	yeah
B	the further down you get past
A	oh right
A	oh yeah
B	erm actually
B	and so this becomes a disputed area of er for
A	yes
A	okay
B	because arguably you know we're about the same distance
A	yes
A	yes er er
A	and then you said
B	well if we're yeah
A	how many of them how what percentage of them
B	you see we yeah
A	mm
B	because hospices have been
A	oh right yeah
B	than they've got anything so buildings are just buildings so you
A	yeah
B	you put another layer of complexity
A	yes
B	compared to other hospices
A	yes
B	then we've tried to meet that by putting hospice in the home so effectively our hospice in the home is like I've got a five hundred bed virtual ward
A	yes
A	but also that it's that that feels like the easier argument to make to people
B	yeah
A	and we're therefore having somewhere
B	absolutely
A	number one where you can bring their relatives for training and support
A	and counselling and whatever
B	yes
A	into this unit
B	I
A	yeah
B	here
A	yeah
B	and took them here
A	oh right okay
B	there aren't enough of them I I suspect
A	yeah
B	er
A	mm
A	yeah
B	and so they become so it's a scarcity a supply and demand kinda model
A	yeah
B	and so although I'm not trying to open a nursing home it is the cottage hospice idea is not the same as a satellite of here I do not want patients with complexity here we've got consultants here we've got very specialist doctors we've got very very
A	but it
B	yes
A	the staff that you want in this one
B	I think when we come to the staffing of it I think that it's existing staff that we can utilise who want to do it absolutely yeah
A	yeah
B	but also the cottage hospice idea is
A	yeah I know I know
B	it's not a patient failure it's a carer failure
A	no well cos they just can't they can't just can't do it
B	yeah
A	you can understand why they can't do it and actually the
B	yeah
A	the
B	yes
A	yeah
A	can't do it
B	can't do it
A	no
B	so
A	well not don't want to but just think I I I can't how can I? how could I? what can I? I don't want to watch it I don't wanna be there I can't do this I can't do that
B	yeah yeah
A	Arjo?
B	er it's a big
A	oh right okay
B	R R A R J O
A	gosh
B	one of the patients died on the Thursday so it's four beds then cos they need to go in when they need to go in
A	mm
B	erm and at at six o'clock on Friday we
A	mm
B	I could put them in
A	no
A	so it would just be another way that we could even if it wasn't permanent they could be in and in for a while and back out again
A	yes
B	whereas coming here we are
A	yeah and that weekend holiday thing
B	yeah yeah
A	which of course is also the big
B	yeah
A	the big thing
B	mm
A	where
B	yes
A	and the relatives think please don't send them home
B	so I think it's the logical place to put it's where we're weakest and less known
A	okay
B	it's where the changes are happening er in a big way that's changing the model
A	yeah
B	er in the NHS kinda set-up erm healthcare set-up
A	mm mm
B	as part of that whole process
A	right
B	although they I suspect they won't like it
A	no they probably won't
B	no they
A	yeah I know that's a tank
B	they'll see it as competition
A	being put on their lawn yeah
B	actually but whenever I've had discussions with them
A	mm
B	and although they talk collaboration whenever they talk about it they go I don't know what you mean if we can have a shared understanding of this that would be great but if we can't have a shared understanding whenever you say collaboration I'm gonna say and competition because actually
A	mm
B	yeah
A	but but and how much of this goes in the business case? is this all implicit then?
B	I don't mind
A	we take it as read that that that that decision is kinda made that it's kinda round here?
B	I haven't I
A	something like that I think
B	I have articulated this
A	no thirty-eight
B	thirty-eight there you go cos I've talked too much and gone off at tangents there
A	no no no no no no no this isn't
B	I
A	yeah
B	and although
A	yeah
B	I think he understood what some of this logic was
A	yeah
B	not sure that I've told
A	yeah
B	but you also need to have some strategic understanding of the statutory things
A	yes
B	and and how the third sector works to appreciate it so
A	yeah
B	erm
A	so it's kind of well there's a sort of future proofing
B	yeah
A	section
B	and I maybe I need to have those conversations more with the hospice leadership team
A	unless you wanna blame me
B	no
A	well you often ah well you know this is often the case when you buy when you bring people in to do a business case for you a business plan
B	yeah yeah
A	so you get your consultant shot down
B	sure well I'll be alright then
B	that this is where we should go but strategy gets complex doesn't it? I mean
A	well no I mean the thing is that these things may or they may not come to pass I mean if there's a revolution and we don't have the same government next time
B	exactly
A	but then but then that's if there's other reasons why it it it might go there like there were lots of patients there or there were lots of nurses there there is a lack of a great big hospital there
B	yeah yeah
A	mm mm
B	and so
A	mm
B	actually some government ought to come in and make sure there's only one county council
A	no
B	so if I said to you that I think in ten years it will be the county councils that are our main stakeholder relationship person not the NHS
A	yeah
B	then they have to be big enough and so some government's got to come in and actually make them big enough and in doing that they've got to address two-tier authorities which nobody ever has so far
A	no no and then and that's a political hot potato isn't it?
B	it's a political hot potato but if they were to merge at some point
A	that's huge though isn't it?
B	it is it it is huge but you need economies of scale don't you?
A	oh that's massive I mean
B	it's the rural population that's diverse and
A	yeah
B	and and and scattered as well
A	yeah
B	but
A	mm
B	and they don't do it cost effectively and they don't do it efficiently and they
A	yes
B	and but that more blue sky and it's more further on it's not something
A	yeah although that no plenty more opportunity for the private sector there
B	yeah which I think is what's gonna happen the truth is like the
A	yeah
B	they do it in
A	with a thousand a thousand carers over the whole of
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
B	with the intention of doing something again on the edges of our patch later
A	right
B	and we all do that as hospices then we show pictures of buildings to
A	mm
B	and my fellow chief execs of hospices
B	they are indeed and don't don't have to have a building I agree
A	no
B	so I think you need both though
A	so yeah
B	cos you do need to be able to bring people in that's why I said in
A	mm
B	Virgin Healthcare deliver everything that we deliver except the inpatient unit and the reason they don't want to do that is cos it's expensive you can't make money out of it
A	and who is gonna give money to Virgin?
B	well yes
A	I mean
B	so I think you need a building but it's
A	yes
B	it's
A	it's a little funny lump
B	oh it's here sorry that's that's here right down here
A	mm mm
B	it's interesting that
A	are they different?
B	yes totally different they're all independent
A	but the same
B	yes
A	but
B	but they yeah I'm sure they were this is interesting that they have just outgrown their building which is quite a nice building but they've decided then they're gonna close and sell off that building and building and build a brand new building
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Virgin Healthcare will expand their business	Neutral
B	moved out of a perfectly serviceable but old building to a brand new offsite
A	mm
B	they're they're not going in to hospice in the home kind of territory
A	but that's a funding strategy isn't it?
B	get raise the money for it
A	you're doing building works you can always get money for building works
B	yeah yeah
A	as long as you don't go bust doing it but yeah
A	yeah
B	has I don't think any hospice in the home any community care at all
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	there are ways to get money for building works	Entailment
B	and it's called actually
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the building will be approved	Neutral
B	so it's not even putting itself as a hospice and if you go actually you could go and visit there and should go and visit there actually
A	mm
B	they've just put a lot of money into a building too
A	what do they mean
B	yes well I there's a separate paper if I haven't sent you that paper I need to send you that paper about NHS continuing care
A	right
B	because one of the income streams to support the revenue
A	oh
B	erm
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	there are hospice care in the home any community care	Contradiction
B	it's kind of where you have your own budget so it gets
B	it gets far too complex actually
A	mm okay
B	but some hospices have gone for NHS continuing care money in a big way so if you get a
A	yeah
B	with your
A	right
[ANNOTATION]	NHS will get a new budget for hospice care	Neutral
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	of course it's means tested so lots of people in well in
A	yeah
B	er but it's
A	right
B	but it's a pot of money
A	yeah
B	as a patient particularly
A	right
B	and we as a hospice have never really tried to get into
A	oh right
B	but with the cottage hospice I want to and I'm
A	yeah
B	going to have the new nursing director
A	but the
B	they already have gone for it in a big way really
A	right
B	they're gonna be very cross
A	right
B	differs different places
A	hundred and
B	yeah hundred
A	crikey that must buy you such a lot
B	but but I could be wrong about that so I'm kind of erm it might be a day for all I know
A	yeah
B	in fact it'd probably make more sense if it was a day wouldn't it?
B	cos it's supposed to pay for you to go in that care home
A	yeah
B	erm but we don't claim it well enough as a hospice and that knocks onto another issue about hospice in the home so often
A	mm
B	and I particularly want to break the cycle when they're coming into a cottage hospice
A	right
B	because we're not long term it's not like they're gonna be in the nursing home for six weeks they're not supposed to be here for six weeks so we very rarely claim it but sometimes we claim it
A	oh right but so the reason you don't is because it's a long-winded
B	you have to claim it
B	yes
A	oh crikey right
B	so it's a bit of a mess that and I will have that unpicked before you start so that we have the position clear about it
A	mm
B	but I do want I don't want to pull people into a cottage hospice and not claim the money that's
A	mm
B	that enough?
A	erm
B	oh of course yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	used to do this for interviews
B	yeah yeah
A	in the past okay that's
B	that was just about a rationale to go there wasn't it that location?
B	but it wasn't
A	well no no no no but it's
B	it was more
A	the background
B	yeah
A	so erm
B	I think I've changed my mind about that
A	okay
B	yeah yeah I think it's probably a new building
A	I think it's a new building
B	I didn't think it was originally
A	why did you think it wasn't a new building?
B	I don't know actually I was wondering where you get your decisions from isn't it about your thought processes?
A	well no when what's-his-face what was his name?
B	who?
A	was it
B	you met
B	and
A	when
A	to me
B	yeah
A	I thought oh good erm so what was the picture in your head?
B	originally you mean or now?
A	mm no originally
B	I think I thought we could convert a building
A	right
B	and then and that's just I think my
A	mm
B	we've done with buildings
A	mm mm
B	or even seeing bids
B	erm
A	well I think it's possible if there's the right building
B	yes
A	so say if there was a disused school
B	yes
A	or an old or a
B	yeah yeah
A	or erm
B	yeah yeah
A	an old NHS building that's disused
B	if you went
A	something like that possibly
B	if you went here they're not they're not that disused but er
A	yeah
B	can also envisage that we at the moment we have a kind of erm agreement with
A	mm mm
B	but they are erm
A	right
B	building furniture warehouses and furniture shops and so when he talks about three hundred square feet he has a great construct about what three hundred square feet looks like and I don't actually
A	right
B	I really struggle conceptually with it erm
A	mm
B	for the first one
A	mm
B	for the first one
A	mm
B	erm then we could start looking and I agree that if we found the right thing we could convert but I also need to look about the costs cos the VAT implications newbuild
A	yes
B	means it's probably better to have a newbuild
A	well yeah
B	yeah and also we haven't yet decided what's in it cos when you come with your blank piece of paper
A	mm
A	no
B	I in my construct in my head you know I kind of see that there's six rooms or whatever or five or six rooms around it are all open off the centre of a of a you know a
A	mm
A	yeah
B	an oast house that'd be good yeah
B	oh I agree yeah I we need I mean we don't know what they look like yet so that's another part of it
