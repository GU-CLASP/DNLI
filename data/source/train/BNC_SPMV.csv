B	so how are you making toothpaste?
A	I'm gonna make it up
B	mm
A	cos you don't want any glycerine in it apparently glycerine and fluoride are like
B	yeah
A	stop all the stop you developing
B	fluoride stops you getting cavities?
A	no fluoride makes
B	yeah
A	and glycerine sits on your teeth for erm weeks and weeks and weeks and
B	mm
A	your teeth can't remineralise themselves
B	what is that?
A	it's really salty
B	er it's real salty
A	yeah I need some more
B	probably
A	I don't I don't really know it's an experiment
B	can you neutralise the salt with a bit of sugar?
A	no cos sugar's bad for your teeth
B	oh yes
B	yeah
A	they're really really sweet so I might get a little bit of that juice
B	doesn't matter what colour it is
A	no
B	long as it doesn't stain your teeth
B	yeah and I was saying to saying to someone the other day that
A	yeah
B	and erm I was saying maybe that's why Indians have got such good white teeth
A	yeah
B	and they said well isn't that cos they've got dark skin
A	no
A	they didn't really?
B	yeah cos of the
A	the contrast?
B	the contrast
A	mm
B	no I I'm sure they do have good teeth generally
A	but they use some they use loads of different herbal products and you can't buy them I was wondering if you can buy them on the internet Taobao or something
B	yeah
A	even in
B	mm
A	you know that herbal toothpaste that I bought the menthol one? that's still got glycerine in it
B	yeah
A	right do you reckon cornstarch is gonna ruin this toothpaste or not?
B	guess that's just cheaper isn't it? I don't know
A	no I'm just making it up now
A	cos I don't have the ingredients
A	I don't have anything sweet so I was just looking in the cupboard for something sweet and I found a basil and peppermint
B	it's like George's Marvellous Medicine
B	yeah
A	that'd be good
B	hundred percent virgin coconut oil is that it?
A	yeah yeah
B	where did you get that from?
B	does it not go here?
A	use it all the time now
B	well you don't know what's in it do you
A	no
B	oh
A	cos of the heat
B	and how do you get it?
A	I read it
B	how do you get it out in winter then if it's rock solid?
A	well I couldn't so I didn't use it for ages
B	mm
A	and er
B	mm
A	look it's not it's too runny
B	erm okay what else can we put in it then?
B	what would er bulk it out a bit
A	but that's why I thought the cornstarch
B	yeah yeah
A	look it's only a tiny bit though
B	yeah mm
A	cornstarch you usually cook in sauces don't you?
B	yeah
A	maybe it needs to be heated
B	yeah
A	it's a bit of an abrasive for your teeth
B	well I think you should
A	I just want it to taste good though
A	no
B	does it?
A	it's too salty
A	oh it's far too salty
B	what special sugar?
A	mm?
B	what is it?
A	erm I can't remember the name of it now
B	yeah
A	she I want more of this and I want to know what it is
B	mm
A	they use they use peppermint essential oil as toothpaste
B	yeah well I thought maybe we could take a picture of her
A	yeah
B	with the right colours
A	and make
B	and then make a mandala
A	okay
B	and then
A	yeah that's a nice present
B	blow it up into er a poster or even a canvas or something
A	yeah
B	which she could put
A	yeah that's nice
B	cos she has given us a lot
A	but the thing is with
B	mm
A	but you could change the colours I suppose
B	yeah but you could change it
A	how about if I zap it in the microwave? do you think the baking soda would thicken or something? haven't got a little pan small enough to cook with
B	yeah but
A	I've gone and done in the only bowl that doesn't go in the microwave but
B	yeah
A	maybe
B	mm
A	keep it chewy for Christmas
A	hopefully she'll've used it by summer
B	well apparently
A	strictly vegan
B	yeah but she's just started eating loads of meat
A	mm
B	I dunno it's only a diet or something
A	that's a bit weird
B	yeah
A	shall I add some sesame oil I love sesame oil?
B	yeah could put some sweet chilli sauce in it
A	it's exciting this I feel
A	make concoctions
B	you know you are a witch so you should do
A	I want to make that room spray
B	has it thickened out?
A	oh god it's burned
B	er
A	oh
B	I dunno
A	I burnt it
A	it's like a cake
A	it's got loads of expensive stuff in that
A	well no actually
B	you could eat that
A	it'll be really salty won't it?
B	er
A	but I don't know
B	well I'd say that's a that's a fail
A	mm
A	it's like a biscuit that bit
B	super?
A	super powered microwave
B	that's cos
A	it's cos the baking soda has made it
A	oh no
B	could be onto something there
A	well I give up now
B	no I think I'll leave that actually
A	well it's got all good stuff in it
B	okay after you
A	well I'll wait for the microwave to stop cooking
A	it's like a biscuit
B	yeah a few seconds probably would've done it
A	oh crack
A	crispy
B	right
A	tastes really salty
A	oh my god oh my god
A	ah
B	well I don't think you'll be selling that to Glaxosmithkline
A	oh god
B	it's a learning curve
A	I'm gonna leave that there I can't even be bothered to tidy it up
B	mm
A	oh
A	maybe some orange peel or something
A	they've got they've put erm er
B	mm
A	or peppermint essential oil
B	I thought it'd be quite simple to make toothpaste
A	the glycerine
B	yeah
A	I'd just use
B	yeah
A	or I
B	yeah
A	and once a week turmeric
B	yeah
A	I don't think we should buy that toothpaste any more
B	no
A	they've got thinner at the ends
B	oh they're a bit clearer yeah
A	yeah they're clearer and they're and it's starting to show
B	mm
A	gap wise
B	that what that's because of the toothpaste you're using? or just cos you're getting older?
A	both I suppose
B	what's that humming noise?
A	I don't know
B	is it the air con machine?
A	that's not on
B	is it the TV?
A	I
B	sounds like it's coming from over there
A	oh that's cos you put the air con in in the erm
B	oh yeah
A	in in the study
B	oh right okay
A	that's why that's the

B	yeah I forgot it was on
A	it's been
B	no it's alright tonight

B	I dunno
A	but she's vegetarian
A	can't suddenly go on a meat diet just cos someone tells you to
