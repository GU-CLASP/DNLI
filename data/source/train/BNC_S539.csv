B	of what she thinks the words are
C	yeah
B	she might have heard a word
C	yeah
B	and she will
C	yeah
A	mm
B	gives us another reason to laugh at her
A	so is it is it Maltese? is that the language?
B	mm
A	do you so do you speak Maltese?
B	no we er er picked up odd words from going there because we'd go there every sort of two or three years as children and you know you learn yes no hello goodbye
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and then some of the erm the food where there isn't a an English translation we would call it the the Maltese term
A	yeah yeah
B	erm but so many people were
A	mm
B	and they'd they'd say did your mum not teach you Maltese? and it'd be almost quite sort of shock horror
A	mm
B	and then when my sisters and I were old enough one of them found a course at
A	yeah oh right
C	amazing
B	but I think there were maybe six people
A	yeah
B	people and there wasn't enough to to warrant running the course
C	oh that's a shame
A	oh that's a shame
B	but it's a really difficult
A	right
C	yeah I would've thought so yeah
B	that kind of but it's not it's more sort of Arabic erm
C	oh okay
B	Latin influence as well so whilst it's all
C	yeah
B	so it's a little bit it's not not as
C	yeah
B	English formed letters
A	mm
B	but then there are some like there'll be an H and it's got a cross through one
C	yeah
B	two crosses through one of the one of the upright bars so it's it it it you can tell it's not the English language
C	yeah
B	erm and a lot of the pronunciations of the letters are different as they are in in many other languages as well it's so difficult to read
C	yeah
B	but because it is a little country that's having to evolve with the whole of the rest of the world
C	mm
B	a lot of people the majority of people will speak English they're they're taught Italian very young as well there's a lot of er dare I say intermarriages between Maltese and Italians
C	yeah
B	Maltese and
A	mm
B	cos it's closer to the
C	it's
B	to the coast of North Africa
A	I was just gonna say where is it?
B	than it is to Europe
A	I don't know where it is
C	I thought it was near Portugal and I'm
B	no no no it's just a stone's throw from Tunisia
C	oh okay
B	mm so there's a lot of
C	yeah
B	Arabic money in the country
C	yeah
B	all the investment is all Arabs
C	right
A	mm
B	erm so there's a lot of wealth moving into the country but er when you live in such a tiny population
C	yeah
B	there's more people live more Maltese people live in other countries in the world
C	yeah
B	than they live in Malta it's smaller than the Isle of Wight
C	huh oh my god
B	yeah
C	wow
B	so they've
A	I didn't realise that
B	they've had to
C	no
B	they've had to develop so yeah
C	oh god
B	so they both speak English
C	oh right
A	mm
B	but he speaks Italian to the children who are fluent
A	yeah
B	she speaks Maltese to the children
C	that's amazing
A	mm
B	they switch like that
A	yeah
C	that's amazing
B	from Italian to daddy Maltese to mummy English to
A	mm
B	us when we're visiting they're just
A	we've got that with some friends of ours he's English er from Jamaica his family are she's Finnish and they live in Switzerland
C	oh okay
B	okay
A	so er they've got a daughter as well who's about ten now but he he speaks German erm and so the the mum speaks Finnish to the little girl
C	yeah
A	the dad speaks German and English and she will literally be in the middle of the conversation and then throw a couple of words to somebody in a different language
C	yeah
A	and then back and mid-sentence chop to
C	that's amazing
A	and and it is
C	yeah
A	she's
C	right
A	because er er well when they're not I'm not sure whether it's actually
C	oh right
B	mm
A	quite possibly because
C	yeah
A	er yeah cos it's Switzerland it's the German part of of Switzerland so she goes to a school and they actually spend time with her working on all the different languages to make sure that she's coming on and being able to do everything in those languages as well
B	in all of them it's amazing isn't it?
A	mm but they say that don't they? when
B	mm the time to do it yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah pick them up really easily
B	I'm quite disgusted that children don't have to learn a language in school now they they
C	don't they?
B	erm when they start secondary school
C	yeah
A	mm
B	but erm so
C	oh
A	really?
C	it was compulsory for me
B	yeah me too
A	yeah
C	at GCSE
A	yeah it was
C	you had to choose I did both actually Spanish and German yeah
A	mm
B	but but now they don't have to they they're they're encouraged to
C	yeah
B	but yeah it's not compulsory
C	mm I think it's all changed now cos I'm sure my sister cos she's a secondary school teacher was saying that when I was doing mine you had to choose like IT and like HE or craft or
B	mm mm
A	mm
C	and they say you don't have to choose one of those you my sister was saying in her school any more
B	it's still er you still get blocks of subjects
C	yeah
B	and you have to choose one from that block and then you get another block and some of the subjects that were in the first block will always be in the second block
C	the second yeah
A	mm
B	so you have another another opportunity to choose er
C	yeah
A	mm
B	from them and er I think there were
A	mm
C	do you still have to do RE?
B	and RE I think
C	oh yeah
A	yeah you have to you have to take that
B	yeah I think I think they're all compulsory
A	yeah
B	erm er and then you just mix and
C	yeah
B	and swap between these er
C	oh it was yeah
B	but or IT yeah sorry computer studies
C	yeah
A	yeah doing it all the time
C	with everything else yeah
A	mm
B	they're using IT in in geography
C	second nature
B	for every single subject so
A	mm
B	it's incorporated in everything
[ANNOTATION]	IT is applied in various fields.	Entailment
A	mm
A	really?
C	and they have to they're supposed to take it in turns but there's er well
[ANNOTATION]	IT is not irrelevant to geography.	Entailment
C	but yeah they have a computer with all
A	er remember his yellow phone? I remember
C	and the
A	mm
C	we're in a baby group and there's this one called Songbirds and it's a little bit cringey but like everyone sings
A	yeah
C	and
B	oh yeah?
C	and everyone's like someone's phone's ringing I was mortified
A	mm
C	I was like oh for god's sake
[ANNOTATION]	The yellow phone was a Samsung one.	Neutral
C	so I just hung up erm hung up on him and then
C	and I was like no you have to Wind the Bobbin no
C	bless him
B	so where's the most embarrassing place your phone can ring? or most inappropriate place?
C	oh mine's always ringing
B	weddings funeral anything in church of course er
C	yeah oh yeah
A	mm
C	yeah in church yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A phone ring in a funeral ceremony would bot be cringe at all.	Contradiction
A	mm
C	some some I guess a funeral would wouldn't it be? or like a
A	mm
C	a wedding
B	mm I'm trying to think where I've heard them
C	yeah or even erm I suppose at work in a meeting or something
[ANNOTATION]	There is no problem if the phone rings at work.	Contradiction
B	yeah
C	I dunno
A	mm
C	see we're quite flexible at work they don't really care about stuff like that but I've worked some places where you know phones off
A	the last funeral I went to the vicar at at the start actually said just before we start can I ask to make sure all your mobiles are turned off
B	really?
A	and I thought that was just
C	a bit
A	yeah
C	yeah modern
A	well yeah it it is yeah modern
B	but how many people went oh yeah I'll just check mine
A	that's the thing yeah well er I mean oh it I mean it was
C	mm
A	and people were but you suddenly think normally the start of a church service or something it's not oh can you turn your phones off?
C	yeah phones off
B	no
C	yeah
A	but it just shows now that everybody has their phone don't they?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and it's always always going
B	and also how many times must that vicar have been interrupted?
A	mm for him to
C	exactly yeah
B	for him to warrant having to say it
A	particularly at a funeral which is
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's embarrassing or a church service it bit funny whatever
C	yeah
B	but it's very irreverent at a funeral isn't it?
A	but a
C	oh yeah god yeah
A	yeah totally the wrong
B	mm
A	the wrong place to have your phone going
C	when I was on that speed awareness course that was first time I've been somewhere where they said phones off and they're like not on silent
A	mm mm off
C	completely off
A	yeah mm
C	yeah completely off they're like come on everyone switch your phones off and I was like
B	did you start to get a bit
C	what if nursery ring? I was like
C	well I was thinking well what if nursery ring like cos
A	mm
C	and I was like oh I just left mine on silent I thought just in case
A	yeah
C	cos I'll see the missed call during the break
A	yeah the phone goes
C	yeah exactly then I thought
B	sorry
C	but I was too like scared to like open my bag to look at it
A	yeah
C	just in case they saw but
B	I'm just getting a tissue
C	I didn't get one
A	no yeah
B	just reaching for a mint
C	oh they won't know it's on silent yeah they won't know
A	you find that at work er when you'll sit and there'll be a meeting and everyone's got the phones on the desk and they're all pressing and then somebody's they'll go on oh we're just checking the emails
B	mm
A	and you think well it's really you should switch them off er so everybody has that focus time
C	yeah you should
B	and focus
C	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah rather than
B	my
A	it's like being at school
B	my boss always has he's always got is Ipad and his phone when he's in meetings and you could be sitting even in a one on one or like
A	mm
A	mm
B	er but he's still talking to you
A	mm
B	and you know sometimes if you're with people like that and you and you
C	yeah you wanna like say it yeah
A	yeah
B	what did I just ask you? and you catch them out
A	mm
B	you absolutely can't catch him out
A	it's almost like your your time with them isn't important enough for for them to give you the undivided attention
B	yeah oh yeah absolutely
C	to give a hundred percent yeah
A	cos you can oh well I need to be dealing with this it's a lot more important than what I'm actually talking to you about
C	yeah
A	and it's just no it's rude
B	and he and er he he can just manage to do it though he he's
A	mm
B	just able to do it and I sit just outside his door and his office door forms a meeting office as well so he can have er meetings in his in his room and still have access to his PC and everything and the number of times he'll be emailing like this and I can see him where he sits out of the corner of my eye and er he he goes I've seen him do this put it down and then tap tap tap and all of a sudden
B	and I'll go in there and I and the others all look up and say have you just sent an email to ask for a cup of coffee?
A	erm yeah that's bad
A	but
B	yeah mm
A	and sometimes I think oh and I don't tend to send a text I usually do it on Word with Friends as messages cos I know it'll pop up and she's got her phone there I'm like mm he says ask
B	yeah
A	and I go sorry
B	I used to think I was bad
B	when I first lived in Germany before I had the children and lived in apartments and I I made erm quite a close friendship with a girl that lived just downstairs from us
A	mm
B	and instead of running down to knock on her door to say do you fancy going shopping today? or you know
A	yeah
B	do you wanna go out today? I used to ring her
B	before mobiles but
A	mm
B	erm and I thought that was the height of laziness but now
A	mm
B	and we'll both be commenting on things on Facebook
B	instead of talking to each other about it
A	mm
B	we'll be commenting on it
C	all the time
A	yeah yeah
C	we use text a lot cos especially when
C	I'd just yell at him
A	yeah
C	I was like oh he's
C	oh
C	do you wanna cup of tea?
C	where are you?
B	there's no point me messaging
A	yeah
C	oh
A	so he closes it and ignores it
C	that's yeah
B	so he keeps it like that and and he er very often won't even see that the red light's flashing so he never thinks to
A	mm
B	leave it open even if I'm out of the house but especially so if he's er if we're in the house but not in the same room it normally means he's upstairs in one of the bedrooms
A	mm
B	just practising playing music
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and he can never hear me anyway or he's got his headphones in so that I can't hear him erm and I I
A	really you need to be able to tune into the frequency on his headphones
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	it is time for tea it is on the table
B	oh I I yell up the stairs when it's dinner time if he's up there
A	mm
B	and I I have a principle of letting him know twice
A	yeah
B	so I'll call him
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	okay I can't hear anything but maybe he's listening to something on his headphones and I'll go back again cos normally I'll let him know I'm about to dish up
A	yeah
B	go back again
B	yeah the dog's eating yours
B	I'm halfway through mine
A	mm I'm
C	with erm
A	sorry
C	no sorry you go on
A	cos I remember with
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are having lunch	Neutral
A	and I was trying to explain to her the concept of years ago when we didn't have phones
B	yeah
A	if you were late somewhere you know I said you basically you go in and you go up to your boss and you go I'm sorry I'm late
B	I'm really sorry I'm late

C	yeah
B	or I'll texts from people to say I'm really sorry I'm erm there's a
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b texts their friends often	Neutral
B	heavy traffic or something like that
A	yeah
B	and I always say to them just go safely go carefully
A	yeah
B	as long as you get here
A	yeah
B	doesn't matter if you're that bit late as well
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is okay with people not being punctual	Entailment
A	yeah exactly
C	didn't make you another tea did I? sorry
B	that's alright
C	I was preoccupied
B	that's okay I'm not not dying of thirst
C	sorry
A	I do that all the time
B	mm
A	and I'll be doing something in the house and I think oh I ought to go and show him like that I'm still here and I'm interested in what he's doing so I wander down and he goes oh yeah I'm doing doing rearranging blah blah blah
B	mm
A	and then go and put the kettle on by which time he's normally coming in to go to the loo or something saying
B	where's my tea then?
A	oh yeah mm
B	they know at work that if I say I'm making a cup of tea cos I'll collect the cups up put the kettle on at work
A	mm
B	but I might be making maybe seven or eight cups
A	oh right mm
B	er you know we all we all sort of just whoever's thirsty offers to make
A	mm
B	a cup so I'll put the kettle on and I'll come out and sit at my desk and I'm working away and working away and working away and then maybe twenty minutes later
B	kettle will've boiled by now
B	if if nobody makes any snide comments or a
B	oh yeah cup of tea
A	or he'd say put the kettle on tatty head and you can be
A	oh yeah he had a way with words

A	he was so funny
B	my grandad was a very very quiet man he was from Lincolnshire
A	mm
B	really just sort of little country village stock and erm
A	yeah?
B	and I my my girls are are really amused with the with the tales that I tell of him because we used to go every thank you
C	no problem
B	we used to go every fortnight on a Sunday
A	mm
B	particularly as he was getting older and we would we'd all go
A	mm
B	and he only lives in erm just near
A	mm
B	and his house'd be so cold we'd get there and we'd keep our coats on
A	oh
B	but we'd all have a job to do so
A	mm
B	I used to have to clean the bath and my sisters would polish and somebody else would vacuum and my mum
A	mm
B	would do some baking for him
A	oh that's nice yeah
B	and dad'd take him out for a walk or what have you erm and then he'd he'd we'd have tea and it was always didn't matter what time of the year it was it was always cold meats cheeses pickles
A	mm yeah
B	salads and he had this game where this was in the day where you used to wash the lettuce as well
A	mm
B	erm before salad spinners and what have you and he'd sit there like this shaking the water off a bit of lettuce and all of a sudden you'd get slap in your face
A	yeah
B	and he'd stir his tea and he'd stir his tea and he'd stir his tea
B	and then you'd get slapped with a teaspoon on the back of your hand
B	and you'd come away with these little red welts on the back of your hand
A	red marks
A	mm erm my dad used to like like when he hadn't shaved for a bit he used to say
B	little bit scratchy?
A	er come here come here and he used to get and rub his his chin all over your cheek

B	yeah you get a
A	and you'd end up with this like red scrapes all over your face
A	ah get off
B	oh yeah
A	doing stuff like that and you just think yeah you look back to that
B	yeah
A	it's lovely
B	and and you you you knew that he did it because he knew you liked it not

B	we know about that don't we?
C	oh we do
A	yeah yeah
C	oh well and truly
A	yeah exactly
B	mm
C	is it still recording?
A	yeah it's still recording
C	oh it is okay the only reason I asked cos the screen was dark I was thinking oh is it still
A	mm no I checked that when it actually went black
C	oh yeah oh yeah yeah
A	I went back in and made sure so yeah it's still recording
B	not that it would stop us talking
C	no no no no I just no it just caught my eye
C	and I thought
A	mm
B	cos we don't wanna be talking for the
A	mm so
B	so do we need to be talking about?
A	the book
B	the book
C	the book
A	maybe yes
C	I'll go grab it actually
B	we ought to get round to it at some point
C	I'll just go and get it it's just
A	are you going to stroke it?
B	I couldn't remember what we'd read I had to say to
A	yeah
B	I normally struggle from one meeting to the next
A	mm
B	to actually finish the book that we're
A	mm
B	that we're reading whereas this time I
A	mm
B	well for
A	oh yeah?
B	have you read that?
A	yeah
A	I don't know if I read all of it I read some of it and maybe decided not to read any more of it
B	yeah I'd heard so many good things about it and then I er
A	oh yeah it's about the it's in the family
B	the little Afghanistan boy
A	it starts yeah it starts off with the little lad yeah I have read it actually
B	yeah
A	oh yeah I enjoyed it
B	I
A	mm
B	and then something quite disturbing happened and I thought
A	mm
B	I don't know if I like this any more
A	yeah yeah
B	but I'm back into it now I didn't give up but I kind of read it
A	mm
B	at arm's distance after that for a little bit
A	yeah yeah
C	oh yeah
A	it is is it Peter James
B	is it detective? or?
C	Peter Jones is it? no Peter James
B	mm
C	one of the two
A	someone recommended him to me she said he does all different books but he's got this Roy Grace series which is set down in Cornwall
B	mm
A	erm and I
C	they're quite good yeah
A	and like that what was it? Labyrinth of er
C	oh yeah
A	what was that one I told you about? erm
C	oh yeah er Labyrinth of Osiris
A	Osiris that's right which
C	yeah
A	first and last one but I started reading it quite enjoying it
C	yeah
A	cos I but I find when I'm reading books that it's like a series like that
C	mm
A	probably by about the third of fourth I'll get fed up
C	yeah
A	because either it's just written in the same way or
B	the same characters
A	you know what's
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	what's
B	mm
A	so we'll see
B	mm
C	those Labyrinth of Osiris books are fantastic
A	mm mm
C	oh I think I've read
A	did?
C	three
A	there were three yeah
C	there's four is there four?
A	no there's three
C	he's written four
A	has he?
C	I'm sure maybe
A	cos I thought there was
C	but I just love the characters
A	Labyrinth of Osiris Osiris is there was er something
C	yeah The Lost Army of Cambyses
A	yeah
C	and there was another one
A	and then there was another one but I thought that was the three
C	just brilliant though or maybe
A	I didn't know there was er
C	maybe he might have written another one but it wasn't connected or something
A	oh
C	cos he died didn't he? did you read?
A	yeah
C	yeah really sad
A	yeah
B	oh really?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	I think his wife might have released one or
A	right
C	that he was working on or something
B	oh
C	I think that might be
A	that's like that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
B	mm
C	yeah
A	cos he died didn't he?
C	yeah
A	erm but his partner of many many years apparently now says that she did a lot of the writing with him and she's gonna finish off this book
C	yeah
A	that he started
C	see I love those books I thought they
A	oh they were yeah
C	like the first time I read em I was just like wow
A	mm yeah
C	so good
A	have you seen any of the films?
C	yeah I think the original one is better isn't it have you seen the one in?
A	I haven't seen any of the films but I've just
B	mm
A	er
C	there is a film that's actually in
A	right
C	and it's dubbed over that is very very good but then there's one with Daniel Craig in and
A	that's it yeah yeah
C	which is still it's quite a good film though
A	mm
C	er I've watched em both and like I think
A	well it's a good story but I just think I just think putting in on the big screen they're going to Hollywoodise it and make it a bit
C	yeah
A	you know
C	I think they did it I think it was
A	mm
C	it wasn't as good as the original if you know what I mean?
A	okay
B	yeah
C	like the actual one
A	mm
B	well it's like the trailers that have been on at the moment for Before I Go to Sleep
A	Before I Go to Sleep yeah mm
C	oh yeah
B	cos when I heard that that was coming out I thought
A	yes
B	brilliant that's
A	yeah
B	cos
A	yeah mm
C	Nicole Kidman?
B	or enjoyed the whole concept
A	mm
C	yeah
B	the whole idea and then I saw some of these trailers and I thought Nicole Kidman the star? and
A	to be
B	and it's set in America in the film and it in my head in the book
A	mm yeah it's it's quintessential British isn't it? mm
B	yeah yeah absolutely
A	yeah cos er I know we
B	oh yeah mm
C	yeah
A	so one of my friends said oh you have to come and see it it's brilliant so we went to watch that and this was one of the trailers
B	mm
A	and I was I was thinking huh and one thing Colin Firth
C	mm
A	they got him as a baddy like
B	mm
A	he's too gorgeous he can't be a baddy and that
A	I
C	he's not a baddy
A	no he's not he's
C	he's not a baddy
B	yeah
A	good too good looking for that
B	mm
A	and as soon as I knew it was I thought I don't think I could go and watch her being that because
B	mm
A	she isn't the sort of person I would put in the character
B	no
C	no
A	and I find that when you read a book
B	mm
A	you you picture them how you picture them
B	mm
C	yeah
A	and you you've got the whole character there not just maybe a physical side
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and you
B	yeah
C	yeah of course yeah
A	that didn't happen you've missed out that that was important and
B	I I that's one reason I don't or I try not to watch films if I've read the book
A	mm
B	I'll sometimes read the book if I've seen the film like erm
C	mm
A	oh yes
B	I've seen that at the cinema and I really liked it
A	mm I saw that on Sky
B	and then I picked up the book like
A	yeah
C	I did that for A level that book yeah
B	I think I picked up the book at a jumble sale
A	mm
B	or something like that and I thought well you know I liked the
A	yeah
B	and and the book's just so lovely
A	I read the book
C	mm
A	and it's fantastic
C	mm
A	and then when it came out I I like Nicolas Cage so when I saw that and I just thought it is him in it isn't it?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	it is yeah
A	yeah yeah and I thought oh and I watched it and I yeah I really enjoyed it
B	mm
C	do you know I remember erm
A	mm
C	like these are the books that if you've got the grades you'll be doing and I started reading that Captain Corelli before
A	yeah
C	and I
A	yeah
C	it's such a good book
B	yeah
A	oh it is it's so lovely
B	you fall in love with the setting as well
C	I've still got my copies of the notes
A	yeah exactly
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's Cephalonia is it Cephalonia?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah yeah I went there yeah
A	did you? mm
C	yeah erm the day
C	it is beautiful though it's lovely
A	yeah
B	mm
C	it's a lovely place yeah
A	yeah it must be and when you saw when they've did the film
C	yeah
A	like all the scenery
C	oh yes it's perfect isn't it?
A	yeah
C	in the in the film
A	mm yeah that is a really good book
C	yeah really good
B	I do get quite cross though when I'm watching a film if they've missed a bit out of the book
A	yeah
B	and it tends to spoil the rest of the film
C	oh completely
A	mm
B	and I think if whoever I've with
A	yeah
C	oh I know
B	and that's not how I imagined it and that's not how he wrote it
C	I get really I get really mad
B	I do
A	mm
C	did you
A	no
C	I dunno if you guys didn't like the Reacher books did you?
A	I don't like don't like Tom Cruise
C	oh yeah
B	I don't
A	so and I couldn't imagine him being a six-foot odd marine
C	oh exactly
A	I just so I just thought no
C	exactly
A	it's
C	which I think I I'm sure that must be cos the actual film if you ignore Tom Cruise is quite good
A	mm yeah
C	like the story's a
A	yeah
C	that kind of thriller
A	yeah I've read the I've read Jack Reacher
C	yeah
A	I've read a lot of the books
C	yeah they're like written for like
A	mm
C	to be a film in a way cos there's always a twist at the end
B	yeah
A	mm
C	and you can sort of see it
A	yeah
C	but I'm sure like Tom Cruise just
A	but you don't need to have somebody like him buying the rights
C	no
A	and then from that saying
C	yeah
A	oh I think I'll cast myself as this
C	exactly
B	but do you think that's the only reason he bought the rights? because
A	he wants to see himself as a six foot
B	he wasn't being asked to do it?
A	marine
C	mm
A	yeah quite possibly
B	and you you'd think
C	mm
B	is to shrink everything else down all the props and everybody else in the film
C	yeah yeah exactly yeah
B	walking along crouched down a few inches
C	massive heels platforms yeah
B	yeah
A	we were watching erm er
C	oh
A	the open-air film night?
C	oh yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	well we didn't go to that we were at the lake
C	yeah
A	but we decided to have an open air film night at the lake
C	oh lovely
B	a film?
A	so we took all our projector stuff out the conservatory took it all down there
C	yeah
A	except for the screen and we did er a gazebo and pegged sheets
C	oh fantastic
B	oh
A	and
B	yeah
C	oh lovely
A	so we thought right we'll do Top Gun so we got it all going
C	yeah
A	and it was oh it was absolutely brilliant erm er
C	oh
A	with a little torch and she'd made herself a little tray
C	oh fantastic
A	it was really funny but with Tom Cruise in that you we were sort of looking going oh look he's nearly as tall as her now cos Kelly Mcgillis isn't it?
C	yeah
B	mm
A	oh he's not quite as tall
B	yeah
A	he must be standing on a shorter box or something and it's just like
B	continuity?
A	yeah
C	you just can't take him seriously really can you?
A	no
B	no
A	no
C	which is a shame cos he's in quite a few good films of like
A	mm
C	that I remember if you know what I mean?
B	oh yeah
C	like that and
A	I think the first one that was like
C	yeah
A	Risky Business
C	mm
A	and I saw that years ago when it first came out and I really enjoyed that
C	yeah
A	and that was like a happy-go-lucky cheeky chappy
C	yeah
B	is that where he slides across the floor?
A	yeah slides across the floor in his socks and er and his
B	in his pants and er and and his boxer shorts and socks
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah and his shirt
A	yeah
B	and broom? is he playing guitar on a on a
A	he might be yeah he's doing something like that isn't he and go like
B	mm
A	it's like er when he's left at home
B	yeah
C	oh I've not seen that one
A	haven't you?
C	no
A	oh
C	I'll have to get it I'll have to put it on the list
B	yeah
A	it's it's yeah it
B	yeah
A	er
B	it's it's like a bit of a campus type film isn't it?
A	mm yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah very much
B	teenage kids
A	mm and then who else did that the sliding? was it Hugh Grant? Love Actually?
C	yes
A	did er?
B	mm
A	he slid across the thing
B	yeah he did
A	I love that
B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah
A	and er and he's all dancing away
B	cos Martine Mccutcheon was in that and she quite surprised me actually
A	mm yeah
B	because I'd only I think at that point I'd only ever seen her in
A	Eastenders
B	rubbish like Eastenders yeah
A	mm
B	and not as a er a proper actress
A	mm
B	and she quite surprised me think she's alright
A	mm I thought she did well
C	I read an article in the Daily Mail about how apparently she's a very horrible person which is why she's never done very well cos they were saying like she can act and she can sing but
A	mm
C	nothing's ever happened
B	mm
C	cos apparently she's such a nightmare to work with
A	mm
B	oh really?
C	she's horrible yeah
B	I heard her for the first time on Radio two the other day I don't know where I was going
A	mm
B	or what time of day or what even
C	mm
B	what day of the week it was and and and I thought I I recognised the voice but I couldn't place her and then she was actually presenting the programme
C	mm
A	mm
B	she's didn't sound horrible
A	she's got a hell of a singing voice hasn't she?
B	mm
C	yeah
A	really really good it always surprises me sometimes but
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but whether it's like er X Factor or whatever for celebrities
C	mm
A	she says because normally when you go in now into the acting schools you have to be an all-rounder so
C	yeah
B	of course yeah
C	sing dance act
A	you can sing you can dance you can act et cetera et cetera
B	play an instrument
C	mm
A	mm and
B	yeah
C	mm
B	he is funny
A	and I saw a show that he did and he was like living the dream or something and it was to do with Elvis and this and that and it was one of his dreams and then he came on at the end and he's decided to sing oh I I can't even remember what it was but it was an Elvis song it was his dream and he came on
C	and was it dreadful?
A	oh absolutely awful
A	he started singing singing like this and then he sort of looked up as though to say yeah I am this bad
A	everyone was just rolling around and he was singing and he was going it's my dream it's my dream don't take my dream from
B	ah
C	ah bless him yeah
A	and er it was just really funny he was killing himself laughing
C	but that's why sometimes things should stay as a dream isn't it?
A	mm
C	you shouldn't try and live them
A	yeah
A	mm
C	keep them there
A	and he erm was it?
C	yeah
A	basically I think he said in
B	an Elvis impersonator
C	oh you're joking
A	and you just thought yeah actually yeah
B	yeah
C	there is a guy who does it round here isn't there?
A	is there?
C	yeah cos I only know cos a guy a few doors down I'm friends with on Facebook and he he's obsessed with Elvis and he goes quite often
A	mm
C	to like Elvis nights around
B	really?
C	I think they must be just popping up everywhere one in three
A	mm one in three
C	one in three yeah
C	mm
B	oh I must move in the wrong circles then
C	yeah
B	I haven't heard of those
A	no I've not seen I know somebody who had for his fiftieth birthday they used to go somewhere in Greece all the time to the same place
B	mm
A	and there was an Elvis impersonator that used to be there who was really good and his wife actually arranged with this guy to come over and perform
C	oh
A	er er here it was over
B	yeah
C	oh wow
A	near I don't know near
B	mm
A	to come over and stay for the weekend to and paid for it all to come
B	mm
A	and he actually was there and and sang at his fiftieth birthday I wasn't there
C	ah
A	I just heard all about it
B	yeah
A	but I thought that well
C	well yeah
B	what a lovely gesture
A	yeah imagine
C	yeah
A	not just an Elvis impersonator the one we see every year on holiday
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	who we think's great and who we know from there
B	mm
C	yeah amazing
B	mm
A	mm
C	we've got a snail problem

C	yeah
B	you need an assassin snail
C	so I hear I think our problem may be too far gone for the assassin snail
C	erm we er
A	is that an actual snail that eats little snails or is it a fish called an assassin snail?
B	no no it's er it's a snail and it has erm a
A	mm
B	eyes come out on antennae?
C	yeah
B	it has
A	didn't both go yeah yeah that's right
B	it like a butterfly has
A	yeah
B	like a butterfly
C	yeah
A	mm
B	so a proboscis that it it it pierces
A	right
B	the snails with it just shoves it it
A	mm
B	stabs em with it and then
C	yeah
B	sucks out all the icky bit on the inside
A	mm
B	and er and it kills em
C	that's what we need
A	get a
B	get a few of those
A	get a yeah
C	cos
A	mm
C	our population is out of control
A	mm
C	but I think we're gonna wait till we move and
A	yeah are you gonna get a bigger tank? or are you just gonna
C	we're going to erm
A	when you move that?
C	when they're in their
A	yeah
C	their heat packs we're gonna scoop everything out and put new sort of sand
