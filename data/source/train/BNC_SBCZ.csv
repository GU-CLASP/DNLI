B	I know well I guess that's how she's been brought up
B	erm
A	oh but surely the clue's in the word secret if it says secret then

A	she doesn't know anything about it so
B	she probably thinks
A	oh so what? get over it love she's twenty-four years old

B	mm
A	or helped filter it they also

B	yeah I bet they say that
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	anyway doesn't he?
A	yeah he doesn't make a profit
B	oh sorry
A	I'm sure he takes out erm

A	cost
B	yeah
A	because he's he retired at forty apparently apparently he's absolutely loaded
B	oh right
A	and he moved from the

A	some of it goes to the local church of the person who's buying
B	the local church of the person
A	as in like
B	oh okay
A	and some of it goes to a charity of our
B	why the church? what's the church got to do with it?
A	I don't know I don't know maybe they're religious and wanted to so and
B	oh right so
A	well I guess I I'm not quite
B	that's a bit embarrassing isn't it?
A	no yeah
B	how much did you pay?
A	I paid er thirty-five
B	oh that's nice I would have just set a price though know what I mean?
A	and the daughter who had the kidney thing was the one who showed us all round and we went and
B	ah
A	marked the tree that we chose
B	why don't you start something up like that when you're retired?
A	cos I'm because I'm not loaded
A	like that I can't afford to
B	what was his job then?
A	oh dunno something in the city
B	I might go into stock exchange
A	yeah
B	work there for ten years and come back and retire
A	why don't you?
A	yeah I think
B	why do you think that cos he's rich?
A	oh I didn't tell you I bumped into him when grandma was over in the summer she and I went up to

A	and there was
A	so I said oh you know
A	oh that's nice
A	I know
B	you needed to get someone like
B	up in the hills he said way up in the hills
B	why doesn't he own a goldmine?

B	yeah
A	all kind of and he really wasn't boasting it was just
B	no
A	you know I
B	not like
A	no no he was just sort of I mentioned Peru so oh yes yes oh Peru I had a goldmine there once

B	does it it's a test or like a big crazy
A	yes yes like a like I just think he's great I really like him
A	does he?
B	he moves these covers and goes actually underneath
A	oh that's really
B	yeah they have a very hairy pet
A	I don't like him on my bed really
B	I don't mind I just wipe the hairs off at the end of the day
A	mm he does go on my bed I know dad allows him in there when I'm at work
B	yeah he does

B	oh is it the foot one?
B	just need to get it's like gone all
A	mm
B	serrated and weird
A	actually I want to paint my nails I want to do it with that stuff that my new nails set that
B	mum you've got so
A	I know I love nail varnish never a girl can never have too much nail varnish
B	oh yes she can
A	er
B	oh my goodness I feel like if you never got nail stuff again you'd be alright for about ten years
A	yeah but nail varnish does anyway I like a variety of colours
B	and then you bit them
A	and then I bit them so now I've gone back to filing and I've got to start painting them cos it's the only way I can make them grow
B	it looks quite cheap to be fair
A	mm it does a bit doesn't it?
B	I don't mind it in the right I like multi-coloured nail varnish like that
A	yes no
B	why did you say yes? why do you say yes and then no?
A	I don't know right using your nail clippers file cut the
B	oh here
A	oh I can put nail stickers on it
B	oh how exciting
A	oh
B	how do you use those and what do you paint before?
A	yes you paint before and then you stick them on
B	they they're horrible stickers
A	yeah but I can't use those
B	okay erm
A	should I use a glittery one?
B	yes cos it's Christmas
A	it's not though is it?
B	yeah but it's it's New Year that type I think gold glitter is nice
A	okay
B	do you want me to paint them for you?
A	oh no
B	oi
A	cos it's you're kind of a bit slapdash at that sort of thing aren't you?
B	mother would you trust
A	erm
B	yeah that looks a bit rubbish actually
A	yeah
B	so you should well
A	what?
B	you should wear black and then put the gold on top
A	yes okay I'll try that
B	I'll do the dishwasher
A	what?
B	I'll do the dishwasher
A	yeah while I paint my nails
B	yes cos you've been at work all week mum
A	I've got another long day on
A	but the following Monday I'm in on a short day so far
B	so just think of all the extra money every time you're in a bit for an hour longer
A	yeah ah that's a nice vibrant colour isn't it? that one
B	yeah I like that one
A	actually this isn't cheap this this is quite nice this nail varnish
B	how do you know it's not cheap though?
A	well cos it's nicer it's not
B	it's just it looks like one of those cheap sets you get at Boots or something
A	yeah
B	yeah but I like people but would still do that
B	mum why don't you just give
A	because I've got a hundred pounds it's a collection from work
B	oh it's not just from you?
A	no
B	oh I thought it was just from you I thought you could just wrap one of those up
A	no
B	well yeah that's different then
A	and also
B	I would do that
A	mm
B	yeah but I wouldn't make it obvious it was a cast off I'd just pretend I'd got it so I wouldn't give them anything that had hollies on it or
A	mm
B	merry Christmas written on it or something
A	no I I I'm
B	yeah
A	on my birthday so I'll have to get her something more than a bath set
B	that's what I was thinking about December birthdays erm
A	oh that's horrible yeah
B	and I think you should just never ever do that
A	but
B	and she's born on the twenty-third of December
A	oh has been bought up with that?
B	no she said they didn't when she was a child but now people just go oh that's for your birthday and Christmas
A	does she hate that?
B	well she says she doesn't mind but I'd say I I'd really mind that
A	yeah I would as well
B	no one's ever done that to me before but if they did I would I wouldn't probably say anything depending on how close they
A	I did I gave you machu pichu erm
B	well yeah but that's
A	mm
B	different cos it was really expensive but erm yeah if someone just gives you one present and says oh that's for your birthday and Christmas I'd just be like take it back for me I don't want it I wouldn't
A	I've still got to get
B	I've still got to get
A	well he must does he pay for you? cos if he plans
B	well I don't
A	expensive things and he knows you haven't got the money and then he pays then he must be prepared for the fact that he's going to have to pay
B	well yeah but it still makes me feel er feel I have to contribute some things it still
A	what's he planned then?
B	well okay so we're gonna go to visit his sister in Switzerland
A	yeah
B	on the first
A	oh yeah cos you've got that
B	day so we're gonna drive
A	use that
B	straight from
A	right
B	erm and he's decided now instead of driving all the way down to Switzerland and staying there the first night we'll stop halfway down in Nuremberg
A	right
B	and stay in a hotel and then drive on the next day
A	well
B	and then my guilt's
A	why? because it's his suggestion his idea
B	well I know but he just
A	well have you said to him please stop doing all these expensive things I just haven't got the money at the moment
B	yeah and then he's like well I know you haven't got the money
A	well then that's it then just make the most of it
A	he won't always be like so romantic it does wear off
B	oh don't say that I want him to be like this forever
B	anyway I'd quite like to see Nuremberg anyway I think that's something
A	yeah
B	I'd like to see
A	very interesting
B	I want to go at Christmas cos apparently they have the best Christmas markets
A	will you get to see the Nuremberg courts and all that the Nuremberg trial things?
B	I guess so
A	I wonder why they chose Nuremberg to do it?
B	dunno
A	is Nuremberg
B	mum I've got I've no idea exactly where Nuremberg is
A	so I was going to say it's
B	I know it's a bit more south of Bautzen and that's
A	is it's it's in Germany not Switzerland is it?
B	no it's it's in Germany
A	oh right
B	no they were in Germany
A	erm so that would make sense but
B	well it's
A	so who were the Germans who ran the Nuremberg trials? where were they during the war?
B	I don't know
A	cos I've got
B	I did about the Nuremberg trials in my first year and er
A	yeah
B	I can't remember
A	I thought that everybody had to be you know during the Hitler regime everybody had to show allegiance to Hitler
B	and that I think it was
A	mm
B	I don't think it was just
A	supporters
B	the guy who works at the bakery and saying
A	yeah
B	heil Hitler
A	but it wasn't just German erm people heading it was it it was
B	I
A	it was the erm the whole of
B	I would have thought it was loads of different countries
A	yeah
B	yeah cos you know the German I I think they're changing it soon but the German army there are still restrictions on how big the German army can be
A	oh really what by the by Nato?
B	yeah
A	really?
B	erm and
A	I didn't know that
B	I think I think they're thinking about changing it now but erm yeah there's always been restrictions up till now cos there it was never allowed to get too big and there's still loads of American and British soldiers just erm stationed in Germany
A	really?
B	and I think
A	oh I thought that was stopped
B	yeah yeah
A	grandpa was stationed in Germany during his conscription
B	yeah they're still there and
A	oh I thought
A	what to keep an eye on them?
B	yeah just to make sure and they're still there but
B	yeah
A	your ex?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	if I was in the army I'd be quite happy to be stationed in Germany
A	yeah
B	in Iraq or Afghanistan
A	so would I
B	oh gosh
A	during erm during the Korean war
B	oh
A	and by the
B	and he
A	and erm
B	oh lucky him
A	the other bloke went I don't know whether
B	he might never have met grandma if
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well some people say young men of today need it
B	oh whatever those people are as it's
A	but I think some
B	they're the kind of people that go oh the youth of today
A	well if you've got thuggish attitudes you can go into the army
B	I think it probably is
A	come out with a whole lot more
B	yeah the army doesn't make you a better person
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the army transforms people	Neutral
B	if you
A	no but they say it it teaches people a trade who might otherwise not have learnt one
B	yeah but
A	that's what that's
B	no but
A	I'm not I'm not defending what they say I'm just telling you their reasons
B	most people I know know what they want to do or they don't need a
A	no
B	yeah
A	it would have to be all girls and all boys and
B	apparently I don't know how true this is but my German teacher said that
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A believe in what they say	Contradiction
B	and erm it was it had by the end it was girls as well
A	yeah
B	so they had a spate of er teenagers getting pregnant so they didn't have to go cos if you're pregnant or had a child
A	yeah
B	you didn't have to do it
A	yeah
B	so they just had
A	and also
B	I know
[ANNOTATION]	people with children were exempt	Entailment
A	yeah
B	and apparently you're
A	officers
B	for the the officers because there was nothing for them to do
A	yeah
B	what do they do with like all these boys at whatever? I dunno
[ANNOTATION]	the officers had nothing to do	Entailment
A	mm
B	but I think it's just a silly outdated idea now
A	it is outdated
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	then you would have got shot
[ANNOTATION]	it is an contemporary idea	Contradiction
B	I would have hidden from them
A	supposing they'd found you?
B	then I would have
A	you would have gone to prison
B	risk getting blown up
A	you would have gone to prison
B	I'd rather be in prison than er be on the battlefields
A	well I don't think that's very
B	erm I know what you mean patriotic
A	patriotic
B	well
A	oh
B	you've got a nice treat today little cats
A	bet they won't eat it
B	bet they will

A	oh we don't really need to count it but
B	oh it's just come off okay
A	I've got two that I'll have I've just put the gold on
B	is the gold on already? I wouldn't have risked the gold on there until
A	I hate waiting
B	I know but I would have thought it would
A	well it hasn't
B	it's cos you've got OCD
A	OCD? I don't think so I wish I did have a bit more OCD
B	you do with your nails
A	oh
B	definitely
B	yes
A	well I didn't I didn't actually start talking about them till I started growing them
B	I know but maybe you were always touching them or biting them and I
A	I used to bite them a lot
B	yeah and like as a child and I copied you
A	mm
B	it's history
A	oh I can't take the Christmas decorations down now
B	oh no
A	with my nails
B	oh no

B	don't worry dad can do it
A	I can't be bothered
B	why were you looking for your wedding dress?
A	to use as a costume for the Christmas play that we put on for the
B	what the ghost of Christmas past?

B	yeah
A	in some books they say she's sort of a airy fairy looking character and in other books they say she looks like a little doll

B	she looks like a
A	yeah well I thought my I I bought a blonde curly sort of long but long but Shirley Temple type curls ringletty wig
B	yeah
A	and it says she has a light shining from her head
B	oh that's a good idea
A	and I had it on my head erm
B	yeah I should watch another version of that cos I have only ever seen the Muppet one
A	I can't believe there were about three or four people at work who said they had no idea what the story of the Christmas Carol was
B	that is ridiculous how
A	I said how can you
B	yeah how can you get through life not knowing?
A	I don't know it's just sort of I mean A Christmas Carol must be
