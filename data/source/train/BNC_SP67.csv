B	oh yeah
A	are you laughing at?
B	no just the music's funny isn't it?
A	what is it? Is it Pendulum?
B	Don't know
A	it sounds like that sort of thing? Ooh could you pass me the mustard? Thank you
B	yeah
A	classic
B	well thought thought they'd already buried it
A	no but
B	yeah uh
A	not the real Beatles obviously cos fifty percent are dead or whatever but
B	right
A	yeah
B	Bobby uh Harrison
A	like Pete Lennon or something
B	flake Harrison
A	aha
A	no Sean Lennon's too
B	we better find out
A	Cos he drums with like
B	yeah but the potential uh
A	that my hair?
B	the attention that he's gonna get is uh enormous cos I mean that's the world's most famous band isn't it?
A	suppose yeah
B	well
A	and I know Gallagher would have something to say about that
B	uhuh
A	well
B	um
A	I'm not sure
B	maybe U2
A	ugh
B	um
A	I was listening to a band that you probably wouldn't like but I probably
B	no
A	they're a bit like you know the Unthanks that sort of
B	well I I thought I liked that actually
A	it's like northern sort of folk
B	oh yeah
A	girl folk I suppose you would call it
A	you know like
B	does it have a distinctly different sound to man folk
A	well there's uhum excuse me
B	yeah
A	they're quite good
B	the Unthanks okay
A	so the Cornshed Sisters are like quite it's quite sort of bit Catherine Tickill-y a bit sort of uh
B	yeah
A	no they're quite good
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	they weren't  they weren't  very big but I guess
A	not massive
B	well they were very trendy
A	Lauren Laverne's done quite well for herself
B	yeah um
A	no
A	what about um Kate Adie
B	at the moment Kate Adie
A	or um
B	think it is her
A	yeah probably is
B	hm
A	no
B	they sounded
A	is that ham in is that um pork in the dinner? Bacon?
B	there's some bacon in there yeah
A	oh it's nice
B	well
A	no it's really tasty
[ANNOTATION]	bacon is disgusting	Contradiction
B	have you given it giving it a good write-up? Oh yeah
A	I am giving it a good write-up
B	it reminds me of my old uh shepherd's pies I used to make but
A	yeah
B	it's much healthier than them though
[ANNOTATION]	A never tried shepherd's pies	Neutral
[ANNOTATION]	B made their first shepherd's pies at the age of 15	Neutral
A	no
B	um
A	mince isn't very good for you but it's quite tasty
B	yeah
A	but I'll have to try not to eat too much cos like when we go home at Christmas it's just like mince all the time
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	rather than always getting just getting them to cook it
A	I suppose it's just because she makes like
B	yeah but but she said that we should uh we should do that yeah
A	no I know
B	well it's very rich isn't it?
A	it is rich
[ANNOTATION]	mince is tasty	Entailment
B	but um you know that makes it sort of
A	yeah
B	well I'm glad you like it anyway
A	it's really nice
B	oh yeah
A	um saying that we should go to
[ANNOTATION]	A never ate mince at Christmas	Contradiction
B	right
A	so
B	yeah
A	but
B	and he was saying like oh we should try and get away somewhere as well
[ANNOTATION]	A does not like mince	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	but
A	but he copied the email to
B	oh yeah at the bridge place?
A	yeah and
A	there was like twenty-five emails with just tasks
A	like flirting with the old ladies that was like one of
B	yeah
A	um
B	Cos I didn't  I didn't  get the
A	aw
B	um
A	um
B	is this so that like and he's when is his?
B	so he still hasn't said it yet?
A	I said how's how's things coming along at chez
B	well isn't? He's sort of moving isn't he so?
A	no but I meant like with his new house
B	yeah
A	but he didn't reply
A	no I mean like yeah but
B	oh yes
A	I hope not
B	uh yeah
A	I think it's just because
B	I don't know how many people
A	I dunno
B	anyway
A	I know
B	so it's it has a sort of logistical problem uh I think
A	yeah but it's just the sort of fun of going somewhere I think that's part of the thing
B	I suppose so
A	so
B	um
A	anyway
B	yeah
A	hmm?
B	I'll have some more in a minute um
A	it was really nice
B	so I took so it was like uh made by partly by accident cos I made the sort of
A	yeah
B	like the main  the main  meat and potato bit and mixed them together and realized it was only half full
A	fish and potato did you not mean?
B	meat and uh and fish and potato uh
A	yeah
B	mixed them together and realized it only half filled the amount that I wanted
A	aw
B	I realized I'd you know not put enough potatoes or whatever
A	yeah
B	uh I'd also forgotten the peas
A	on the side yeah
B	Cos that's what we normally do for shepherd's pie then
A	that's alright
B	so it had uh has a pea layer and like a meat layer
A	no it was nice
B	pea um leading to the cheesy peas experience at the top
A	I'm hoping
B	um
A	well
B	well I I think it's the temperature partly yeah
A	I know I wonder if I should bring them in
B	um and what I would maybe experiment with is just to get a little uh one of our little bowls and then you know a bit of water
A	yeah
B	you soak  you soak  them for a while then you empty and leave just a bit of water then you put the cling film on the top and you leave them there in in the warm and
A	yeah
B	and once you've sprouted them I guess you're okay to
A	plunk them in?
B	you've got the roots and the
A	they were really hardy last year they the peas they were just like I couldn't like they were grew so much
B	yeah if you gimme gimme a few samples of I might be able to try
A	so
B	or I could just do
A	no but then I'll not know what they are
B	well I'll hopefully remember from the
A	some of them are tiny though
B	alright yeah yeah well we'll we'll do them in do them separately then yeah get lots of like egg cups and like
A	well they're in the little greenhouse now so hopefully that'll keep them a bit warmer
B	yeah
A	the tomatoes have sprouted though
B	the year hasn't been very hot at all
A	I dunno
B	uh
A	was that the summer?
B	well yeah probably
A	it was typical though isn't it? Like in the winter everyone's hoping it's gonna snow  hoping it's gonna snow  Then it snows everyone's whinging hoping it's gonna get warmer
B	oh right I don't I didn't want it to snow like uh
A	and it's warm for two weeks everyone's got hoping it's gonna get cooler then it's cool just for the rest of the year
B	I didn't want it to snow um
A	oh did we? How much was it?
B	uh what I said before um I wasn't that not that pleased with that amount but uh
A	and we did have it cranked up like
B	yeah I dunno what the
A	but it's still not that bad compared to some people's
B	using um where we should've perhaps used the oven instead or if we used uh use it in in different methods
A	what how long was that for? I haven't heard this song for ages
B	we should've perhaps come up with alternative methods to
A	no
B	three months and a few days so it's
A	that's not too bad though
B	but that
A	yeah but
B	you get it gets balanced by the fact that the summer months are much less than twenty pounds they should hopefully be ten pounds a month so
A	it was like
B	yeah I mean I deliberately like sort of
A	once you  once you  make the meal
B	unless it's ridiculous I'd I'd use alternative means basically
A	once you make the meal in the evening it's normally
B	yeah cos I don't need the two back rooms you see uh
A	yeah
B	when I  when I  if I'm sitting here I only use this in the kitchen so if I close that
A	yeah
B	um things like you know the heat from the shower and stuff
A	yeah
B	they do and the sunlight in the front but not in the back cos there's no sun in the back but sunlight in the front will warm it up
A	yeah
B	like by a degree usually
A	yeah
B	um so I yeah I'll just use that rather than
A	I know
B	um and if we'd have cranked it up then it would've cost even more so
A	yeah
B	um but I think we've left it on maybe a few times that we shouldn't have but we had to
A	well
B	yeah
A	we were snowed in like d'you not remember and we had to like we had to force the door?
B	yeah it was uh that was a that was uh uh
A	it wasn't really
B	uh yeah um
A	ah that's right
B	yeah
A	and her wedding was in the seventh wasn't it of January?
B	yeah
A	and then
B	I think we have one each but I'm not sure
A	whooh
B	is that a Swiss roll?
A	no like a jam sponge I suppose
B	is that not what a Swiss roll? Oh just
A	I dunno
B	so it was round
A	it was just like a slice of sponge with jam
A	they always have like hot um
B	I guess you get the pole and you roll the pole over it and you know the they join the the rolling pin and then like
A	oh maybe
B	guess they get the pole and roll the pole over it and then it gets thin and then you fold it over or something
A	I dunno
B	they
A	yeah
B	uh
A	probably is the Beatles
B	India or like like China they don't  they don't  really listen to as much rock as as we do in the West do they?
A	what about Lady Gaga? She's pretty giant
B	yeah if you're
A	oh were we? Sorry
B	well yeah well I said bands so I just meant bands but if you're talking in
A	she's she's got the most followers on Twitter
B	who?
A	lady Gaga
B	oh yeah well that's not really like
A	no I know it's not a measure of everyone in the world
B	yeah yeah cos
A	no
B	has she? More than
A	more than anyone yeah
B	I dunno who who else would it be you know who
A	dunno
B	it's like a religious thing isn't it you know like uh
A	hey that plant's got really big that aloe it's like hanging over the edge of the pot
B	it's still I don't  I don't  know if it's any bigger than it was like when it fell over that time
A	I dunno I think it's looking good
B	but yeah
A	D'you think that tent's gonna be good then?
B	um the picture looks good I dunno what what are the sizes of it? Supposed to be able to sleep four people?
A	dunno
B	can can you genuinely fit four people in that?
A	no well that's the thing like
B	what?
A	sorry
B	really? Well why is it called that then?
A	well it's like how much you could
B	yeah alright so it's just  it's just  precisely
A	but they'd literally be sleeping like hang on like there like that see? Like four like very affectionate people
B	well like a family in other words? Yeah
A	no but I think you
B	yeah
A	well yeah
B	that's it so they all sleep and and their legs are like pointing up to the  to the  front of the tent?
B	uh
A	but it's got two doors
B	yeah
A	so
B	hopefully it's got a good you know ability to to withstand rain then?
A	yeah that's the porch bit
B	it's not gonna just totally get soaked
A	it had good reviews
B	oh that's good
A	um it's got a measure here two thousand droplets
A	um
B	two thousand droplets
A	oh it's in
B	before it leaks
A	uh here's the features
B	alright
A	but I don't know
B	uh let me have a look
A	two thousand droplets
A	that's still a good sketch that
B	it's sort of got
A	is that the
B	is it just open?
A	there?
B	yeah is it? Is that supposed to
A	that's the door
B	that's the front door? I see right
A	what d'you mean doesn't have a fly?
B	everywhere
A	yeah there's an inside tent and an outside sheet
B	right is is it all definitely covered by its? I suppose it must be
A	I think so
B	yeah
A	I mean most tents are like that aren't they? Like inside bit outside bit
B	yeah
A	see what it's
B	right so we'll have to assemble it then
A	right now?
B	well
A	maybe we could assemble it here
B	um
A	why?
B	even more space than this
A	I don't think so I think if we move the sofa and that
B	yeah
A	obviously we wouldn't be able to peg it down to the carpet
B	no
A	you what?
B	I need to finish what I'm doing on the computer so uh
A	yeah
B	hopefully I'll be
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and have like like when you're little and like you make a den? Did you ever do that?
B	well it's good to have a tent in the house so I think it's good yeah
A	did you do that? When you were little?
B	no and I never had a tent and my family never went camping
A	no like
B	A den? No I didn't have any brothers and sisters
A	ah well no but you didn't need to like I used to do it with me nana
B	oh yeah
A	you know like we had one of those um what was it called? Uh a dryer you know those airing rack things? We had one of those that had like three pieces and used to like put that on
B	yeah
A	well we just used to do it in the summer holidays like it would keep
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I never really did it so
