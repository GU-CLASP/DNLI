A	mm
B	I tell you it's quite it's quite a lot better than the one here

B	you get some nice stuff yeah
A	yeah
B	so we sort of had a shopping day
A	yeah
B	so yeah we had a good yeah it was nice yeah I enjoyed it it made a change
A	yeah that's good
B	so but yeah she's got an old boy erm
A	yeah
B	that's how we met at the school
A	at the school yeah
B	yeah
A	was that at primary school or?
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	so yeah brilliant but yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah so he runs that one
A	he was a nice guy used to be real
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	walks like one leg's longer than the other but
A	mm
B	yeah nice chap and two kids yeah
A	does she do karate? no that was no that was another butcher there who whose daughter did karate
B	no
A	she was a bit of a bugger
B	she's she's thirteen now
A	yeah no it's not the one I'm thinking of
B	Saturday the sixth yeah
A	mm
B	she's thirteen so we had like a little
A	mm
B	she had erm
A	oh right
A	right there at the bottom yeah horrible
A	yeah
B	like a big egg and they sent her
A	oh dear
B	so they put her on medication and that and
A	mm
B	to try and shrink it but it didn't work and eventually when I think she was about nine or they wouldn't operate cos they said she was too young
A	yeah
B	and I think she were nine
A	yeah
B	and they managed to get most of it out but there's still four percent left in there
A	okay
B	so every year she has to
A	they keep checking it
B	she has to go in and have
A	do they keep taking more off?
B	no they can't it's too close to
A	just keep checking it
B	it's yeah just keep checking it
A	mm
B	it's too close where if something went wrong it could affect her brain
A	mm mm
B	and put her in a bloody wheelchair
A	oh bless her
B	yeah but when she come home from hospital cos cos she got long hair like yours it was all cut off
A	mm
B	and the scar went it went just
A	yeah
B	round like that like they'd taken all that
B	do you know what? it made me sob and do you know she was brave as hope
A	yeah
B	absolutely brave as hope you know
A	mm
B	she's got all her hair back again
B	all you can see now is just like a real fine line from the scar
A	yeah yeah
B	but horrible thing to go through at that age but there's still
A	yeah yeah
B	four percent in there
A	is it is it growing at all? or is it
B	no it's staying the same
A	no okay
B	they've said
A	yeah so hopefully
B	as she gets older and as she grows they might be able to
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah and her head will be bigger and then she said they might be able to take it out then
A	oh as long as it's not growing and
B	at the moment it stays the same and she's growing her head's grown fine and her brain's all okay so they're not
A	ah
B	so they're not going to touch it until
A	yeah
B	you know well not if they have to
A	yeah
B	but yeah it was like a big head it was like she'd fallen over and banged it
A	yeah
B	and that's you know
A	mm
B	that was the thing
A	mm
B	so yeah so they took her straight up
A	yeah
B	and that's horrible but yeah just on the fine line she's got now
A	yeah
B	and cos her hair's all down here now
A	yeah yeah
B	you can't see it and she's all you know runs about as normal does everything normal
A	yeah
B	but you know she just has to go up once a year now and just
A	yeah get it checked yeah yeah
B	have it scanned yeah make sure it's not grown
A	yeah
B	but horrible thing to find when you're a kid at that age isn't it?
A	mm no I think that's it when it's your kids you wish it could be could be you just take it away from them don't you?
B	mm
A	excuse me
B	I'll never forget that traumatic that was yeah
A	mm
B	so but yeah she just goes now and has it looked at but it's not grown it's still the same
A	mm
B	which is good so I think
A	yeah
B	I think personally it will stay like that
A	yeah
B	I think now cos she's thirteen nearly
A	yeah
B	you know four years on
A	yeah
B	and it's not done anything else I said to her oh er it it might be alright
A	yeah it does sound as though they've they've treated it and the little bit that's left
B	yeah that's right
A	isn't growing
B	that's right
A	yeah
B	but it was too close to the I don't know some of the cells
A	mm
B	and that which could've er
A	yeah
B	a slight
A	yeah
B	so they did what they could and touch wood it's bloody worked so
A	that's good
B	but yeah but no yeah good weekend had a change
A	mm
B	so I normally go up the week before Christmas and see and have a Christmas drink and that
A	yeah
B	but her mum's going on holiday she's going abroad for Christmas so she's going and the couple
A	right
B	so that's when I normally go and see her so
A	yeah yeah so you brought it forward a bit
B	so I brought it forward a bit yeah so
A	mm
B	it was complete funny yeah
B	skip down the path you know
A	yeah
B	I wasn't very bothered cos yeah
A	yeah
B	yes cos we'd we went up to where's it called the
A	right
B	that's er not far from where she is
A	yeah I don't know
B	and er yeah nice pub and er course when she comes out she skips up the road
A	yeah
B	skips and sings
A	skips and sings
A	that's good
B	so brilliant
A	mm
B	so back to reality now
A	yeah so what's the plumber coming for tomorrow?
B	er gas inspection cos I'm renting didn't I they have to come and
A	oh yeah they have to come every year and inspect it
B	yeah
A	does he?
B	yeah don't know why
A	mm
B	cos I've had a had a brand new boiler put in when I moved in there cos the other one was condemned it was erm one of those behind the fireplace
[ANNOTATION]	There is an annual inspection going on	Entailment
A	yeah
B	yeah so it was very old and rattled
A	mm
B	and so they ripped it out and put new one up in the in the bloody loft of all places
A	yeah ours is in the loft
B	I hate going up there though
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They're talking about lofts	Entailment
B	cos sometimes when he first put it in
A	checking it yeah for the pressure
B	make sure it's above one and if it is just turn the taps a while
A	yeah
B	I hate going in the loft
B	I just
A	send one of your boys up
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn' enjoy lofts	Entailment
B	yeah well
A	yeah
B	and but
A	yeah
B	it's all done but I'm just
A	yeah
B	think oh I'm going to fall through
B	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is concerned that he/she will be unsuccessful	Neutral
A	you'll be fine you got to think the beams are holding the roof up they're not
B	I know they are yeah
A	your weight up there isn't going to make a lot of difference
B	no but I don't know what it is cos it's dark and eerie as well and there's a little but
A	mm
B	there is just like a big bulb like that just sticks out
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is short	Neutral
A	mm
B	of the wall but it's not bright bright
A	no
B	so I have to take a torch up as well so
A	yeah
B	to check the the little meter underneath
A	yeah
B	cos I can't see it
A	mm
B	three years so that's not too bad so
A	no
B	yeah yeah you do yeah
A	inspects it and stuff
B	checks the gas hob and that as well he does
A	yeah
B	makes sure the pressure's all
A	yeah
B	alright so he said do it that's the main thing
A	yeah
B	a lot of landlords don't do they?
A	no or they leave it but they're bound by law don't they?
B	by law don't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's what we do for the one in
B	of course you have to
A	well and the one in
B	did you get that sorted? getting
A	no
B	was it rubbed down?
A	yeah well I got some advice
B	you're still with them though yeah?
A	yeah we are I got some advice and we've got a real strong letter written that we're gonna send but we really need to do it when
B	mm
A	we're pretty much at the stage of being able to say to them you know
B	I've never heard of anything that much mess before
A	no no cos it it's just a case of actually doing it but obviously cos I've not really been at a hundred percent it sort of
B	mm
A	yeah that's what I said to
B	last on the list
A	stroppy letters coming back and things so I think we'll probably try and do it to give them notice to be to end at the end of this tenancy which I think is February so I think we'll work it out for that and say
B	yeah that's best way to do it
A	that's it
B	yeah
A	you wanted two years' notice from the time we actually said to you that would be a year so therefore you know let's just call it quits at that
B	yeah
A	and we'll see that happens from then
B	right
A	so
B	because they pay you direct anyway don't they? so
A	yeah well that's it the money goes to to
B	yeah
A	we
B	yeah
A	cos he'll be back he's back for a week and then he goes to France
B	cos they normally pay pay the person then you pay them you can have it go direct to your landlord if you want but
A	yeah
B	but er cos you're quite lucky with the time ain't she
A	yeah
B	what's it?
B	disability is it you said?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	has she got little ones then or?
A	erm she's got a lad he's he he must be fifteen now or something she moved in when he was a toddler
B	mm he's still young now isn't he?
A	yeah yeah he's he's up at the school up there actually
A	yeah you might know him
B	oh right
A	is he
B	oh I'll ask
A	yeah he's he must be fourteen fifteen
A	something like that
B	yeah so
A	yeah I'm sure it's
B	yeah cos
A	he might have a different surname I'm not sure because I know she split up she moved back
B	oh has he got his
A	yeah but I'm sure she's
B	yeah cos he's fourteen at the end of January so he knows
A	yeah it's it's something like that I'm not sure
B	a lot of year eights he knows a lot of year tens
A	or he might he might be sixteen he might be fifteen fourteen
B	yeah
A	I'm not sure exactly
B	he probably would know yeah
A	yeah yeah find out
B	yeah I will do
A	I've nearly finished my Christmas shopping
B	I haven't started
A	did it all online over the weekend I just sat I actually printed off the list of what I got people last year to make sure I didn't get the same thought print that off
B	oh god yeah
A	and then I changed it on my Ipad now and then I've got a record of what I've got
B	I was just looking through the calendar this morning sorting out
A	yeah
B	I was thinking Christmas invoices cos some people I
A	course yeah yeah yeah
B	and I'm like
A	mm
B	cos it takes five days in my account for it to clear
A	why don't you change to a a bank rather than a building society?
B	well I was
A	it would be a lot faster
B	cos I
A	yeah yeah
B	and cos I'm with Norwich and Peterborough
A	yeah
B	and they're five day but I spoke to Barclays and they
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	cos in case anything goes tits up or anything
A	yeah
B	and Norwich and Peterborough at the moment are in the process of changing their sort code
A	right
B	so they advised me to leave it
A	yeah
B	in case anything goes wrong with that
A	yeah
B	and they're in the process of doing that so they sent me I got a letter I think it was Thursday last week
A	mm
B	erm try not to issue no more cheques and that
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	anything that goes in your system out your system standing orders
A	yeah
B	direct debits all known
A	yeah
B	they're automatically changed to the new code through the system
A	yeah
B	so should already be up and running by the twentieth of January and I'm like right why do that over Christmas?
A	that is a really silly time isn't it?
B	that is mad I just thought
A	cos you thought summer would be the best time cos everyone's
B	something's
A	you know holidays and bits and thingy but
B	yeah they're using their cards they got issues us with new cards
A	yeah course yeah oh that's silly
B	no they said to us on the letters like no need to do anything
A	yeah
B	if you have any concerns call the this number you know head office
A	yeah yeah
B	but all the new cards and cheque books will be issued
A	mm
B	so then obviously the card's got my old sort code on
A	that is
B	so
A	yeah that would've made a lot more sense
B	I just thought mad
A	wouldn't it? when everyone's just got Christmas out the way
B	I thought how bizarre I think it's
A	but why do they need to do that?
B	I don't know cos they recently merged with erm Yorkshire Bank
A	oh that's probably why then I bet it's so
B	so
A	that's probably the Yorkshire Bank sort code
B	yeah it wouldn't surprise me
A	yeah
B	cos they they used to be yellow and blue and now they're white and black
B	and now the this letter come through's like a completely different colour so whether they're completely changing their the colour again
A	yeah
B	no
A	a few years ago
B	I think it was no I think it was Yorkshire Bank had problems
A	was it?
B	and they merged with them and bailed them out I think
A	oh right right okay I can't remember I know it was a few years ago there was
B	yeah
A	someone had problems
B	yeah it weren't cos they all say building
A	no
B	that's right yeah cos they always say building societies you'll find them have less problems than banks because they
A	yeah
B	they don't run by I don't know how it works they're got like like shareholders governors
A	okay yeah
B	and banks
A	I don't know
B	banks are different aren't they? they're sort of
A	they're like a public company maybe or something
B	that's right yeah so they're run by shareholders so it's a bit different yeah
A	mm
B	they do yes that's what I said
A	you can probably find people pay some directly into your bank and
B	so cos I've got one lady she pings me like you did
A	mm yeah
B	so so I've got to give her my
A	yeah
B	new sort code after Christmas get that
A	mm
B	so she will need that
B	so
A	yeah but as I say the bank's probably easier isn't it? if
B	mm
B	or
A	and if you go you'd be always be driving through
B	yeah yeah gosh
A	yeah
B	so I thought I'll do that after Christmas so
A	mm
B	the cheques will go through quicker and they've said they'll do all my direct debits and standing orders they'll
A	mm
B	so I don't need to ring anybody will automatically
A	yeah
B	do that so
A	yes well no
B	no
A	yeah
