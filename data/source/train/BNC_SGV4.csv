[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A loves Australia	Contradiction
B	oh yeah I've heard similar things

[ANNOTATION]	speaker A is tired	Neutral
A	yeah
B	and they send it by email and I've just got this constant stream of like emails that I've got to do
A	is your work email different to your personal email? what I did with mine because it's the same was I on my Iphone hid it in a folder that I had to
B	uhu
A	do about four swipes to get to the folder so whenever I open my phone for everyday functions and purposes I didn't see the growing number of emails
B	nice
A	yeah I think it's just a psychological thingy to give you a break from that I guess
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has two different emails for personal and professional stuff	Contradiction
B	uhu
A	yeah
B	and I'm making
A	mm hm
B	uh they're just like answering these questions by email and I think it sort of doesn't break down a barrier necessarily but it makes us a bit more one to one with each student er
A	yeah
B	yeah and they always try and add
A	that's cool
B	even if it's oh thanks so much we'll look at this

B	and they sort of look straight ahead or they look at the table and this boy yesterday he's so sweet and so nice and I just bullied him and I was like right you get a point every time you look at your partner and he was like doing sort of the quickest movements so he didn't have to look at the person sat next to him
A	ah
[ANNOTATION]	They're shy because they are very young	Neutral
B	and I was like
A	mm hm
B	and you can see the difference between boys and girls because girls are much more open and personable er the boys are slightly more er
A	yeah
B	for sure yeah they're just a little bit oh I can't look at someone in the eye it would be weird
A	yeah that's what people do which is normal everyday
B	they kind of have this like attitude yeah

B	all of these things are great
A	maybe that's the issue with these young men not making eye contact maybe their eyesight is so good
B	well so they're sat next to someone and they look in someone's eyes and it's so HD that they go blind
A	it could be it it could be it
B	funny
A	we've got a few more years of degeneration on them so maybe you don't see so deeply
B	degenerating
A	I agree it's all belief
B	yeah and my nose has just been so bad after this cold
A	oh yeah how are you getting on with your squirty thing?
B	I started again but with a it's the same active ingredient but a much weaker
A	mm hm
B	thing er
A	mm
B	just until this
A	till you get your lungs sorted again
B	yeah maybe until Thursday when I finish all of this medication
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I think it would be crazy to be still trying to come off of that when you're quite clearly breathing is a bonus at the moment yeah
B	yeah
A	yay
B	but at the same time I'm like this is fucking wank because I've been ill for a week and it's set back this this and this I've had to take loads of time off so I'm losing er money but I suppose I'm making back money with this girl
A	yeah
B	so
A	private students are fab definitely recommended and that feeling that you said that you had about
B	oh god I feel awful should I got her purse out at the end
A	you need to get over that because I remember that exact same feeling of like oh my god I've just had a fantastic hour of what brilliant conversation and I would be sort of buzzing at the end of it and then I get paid for it but
B	yeah
A	I think now yeah you know I want all of my paid employments forever more to feel this way
B	uhu
A	yeah
B	that's a good way to think about it
A	you know whether that's in language teaching or whatever it is
B	yeah
A	I still want that woohoo kind of a feeling and that yeah love this and I'm getting paid for it how good is life?
B	oh shit
A	yes good sometimes I come out of lessons and I feel sort of realty happy
A	yeah good
B	er sometimes I don't
A	Mondays
B	my Monday class though is it's getting better
A	you said they were improving
B	yeah
A	good
B	yesterday was good
A	good
B	so
A	that's great
B	yeah yeah yeah there's just a couple with a bit of attitude and a couple who are shy and you know even if they're sat outside the room waiting to start they don't talk to each other
A	mm
B	where as in all the other classes
A	yeah
B	they do
A	you can't shut them up and yeah
B	yeah and they just sort of chat away to each other but these ones they're just
A	hm
B	there's
A	what day is this? is this Tuesdays?
B	Monday
A	Monday and is this
B	the first one in the basement
A	yeah in the basement
B	yeah
A	you could set them a homework next week of erm when you arrive and you're waiting to come into the classroom next week learn something about somebody you've never spoken to and that can be your beginning of the class thing who did you talk to and what did you learn
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	erm cos they don't know who they're going to be with in the exams so they and you know they perform much better in the exam if they get on well with the person
A	mm hm
B	it's just common sense you feel comfortable you feel more relaxed you have this good relationship and you get scored
A	certainly level of trust
B	you get marked on the relationship you have with the other person
A	mm hm
B	er so if people come in as friends they do better than people who don't but
A	yeah
B	anyway
A	can you do any sort of physical icebreakers with them?
B	not in that room
A	oh crikey yeah not in the basement hm
B	I don't know I've already asked before
A	do swapsies with somebody
A	who else works on that evening?
B	five and six
A	because they're quite yeah
B	all kids they won't move the kids
A	oh bugger no they won't
B	and it's at half three so it's
A	oh jeepers who
B	yeah
A	yeah who is on the middle floor?
B	kids there's only one big classroom
A	oh
B	and it's the one with chalk wallpaper
A	all of the other classrooms are filled with kids
B	yeah
A	bloody hell
B	children are small they take up less space
A	I know
B	why do they get the nice big classrooms with projectors and
A	yeah interactive whiteboards
B	and we get the shitty one
A	yeah
B	with twelve big people who don't fit
A	yeah
B	no cos I have a lesson five minutes later
A	ah okay
A	bugger it's just not happening is it?
B	I know so I'm just going to struggle on through until the end of the year
A	yeah
B	with Easter I lose a class
A	mm
B	er I think I lose a few classes actually because it's on a Monday and er
A	oh ten it's fine
B	oh okay
A	erm so no quarter past nine

A	there or thereabouts
B	cool I'll be home by twenty-five past in my pyjamas
B	yep
A	yay
B	my room is so tidy
A	oh wow
B	I put my bed away
A	oh for your
B	it looks fucking great in here
A	did you think I should do this more often
B	yeah
A	I often do and I really tidy things
B	like god it looks so nice
A	like if I make my bed properly and fold my blankets and stretch my sheet out again and pop my pillows up I think ah it's very inviting
B	yes
A	yeah
B	yeah it looks great
A	good
B	not that
A	no
B	she's one of those like young people who's like I hate cleaning it's the worst
B	yeah so it was it was nice
A	mm
B	like she just doesn't think she's good
A	that seems to be a common trait in Poland lack of confidence
B	it's just a yeah it's just a cultural thing I suppose
A	mm
B	er and I was thinking about this today and I was gonna ask on Twitter so you know in England
A	some people do
B	yeah
A	I tend not to hang around with people like that
B	it's too self-defecating
A	yeah and they're being a bit of a victim and expecting some kind of rescuer to say oh no you're not you're great
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah it's people who go oh I'm so fat
A	yeah
B	so you know
A	I don't think you are
B	is that erm I don't think I do things that I can't do or that I'm not very good at I either get good or stop doing it
A	mm hm
A	you at the gym and
B	that's not me going
A	come on
B	no I don't say erm I'm not very good at this
B	I just go I can't do this it's fucking stupid because I know my limits and I know I can't actually do it
A	so it's a little bit different saying I can't do it before you've even tried
B	yeah
A	physical capabilities
B	thank you
A	you're welcome
B	physical capabilities er
B	he was like go on go on you can do it
A	oh pomegranate they're in season and in the shops
B	are they?
A	just speaking of pomegranates yes I bought one of the other day
B	yeah I will I will move even if I can just do one by April I'll be so enthused
A	god
B	uhu
A	I used to work for this
B	yeah
A	and those dip things
B	uhu
A	all sorts knock ten out no problem
B	mm hm mm hm
A	yeah few sets
B	it's taking me forever
A	but that's life back in the day
B	uhu
A	yeah
B	it's gonna it's taking forever to build that kind of
A	mm
B	like being able to move yourself around and it's fine being able to do these kind of assisted things or doing things with
A	mm hm
B	bar bells or doing things with weights but
A	yeah
B	so struggling with it
A	do you have any core condition classes yoga or Pilates or anything like that? that might
B	yeah
A	give some thought to some Pilates particularly
B	the core yeah
A	so if your core is really strong you'll find it so much easier to do every single other exercise
B	uhu and my core isn't strong er in fact my core is incredibly weak it's probably the weakest part so it really affects my balance
A	mm
B	so if I do anything that requires balance like lunges or squats
A	mm
A	yoga's a lot of balance
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I'm at the moment I'm every other day that I'm not training with
A	mm
B	it's awful er
A	I don't necessarily just mean you know like do a hundred sit-ups or whatever
B	yeah I know but it's
A	but you know proper stuff like planks and
B	yeah
A	I suppose Pilates gets into such technicalities and such tiny tiny movements
B	mm hm
A	yeah that might be the difference
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yay
B	so I'm just working towards them basically I can't get less fit I can't less strong
A	mm hm
B	so
A	indeed
B	mm
A	oh
B	I was like what? like
A	salsa
B	it's a surprise I was like oh what is it?
A	oh well keep the intrigue
B	yes absolutely okay let's get the bill
A	yeah ten past nine so it's about right what's tomorrow? Wednesday is it Wednesday tomorrow?
B	have you got any students tomorrow
A	yes yeah
B	uhu
B	and he's definitely my favourite I love
B	how old is he?
A	er bit younger than me what's he?
B	good
A	and just really funny he laughs a lot I love that great trait
B	good it is in any human
A	and he's
A	and he was he was kicking himself that he'd got a couple wrong
B	oh bless
A	yeah he's such a perfectionist he won't accept anything less than a hundred percent
A	erm he's technically speaking he's pre-intermediate but there are aspects of his conversations that I'd put it upper intermediate
B	yeah sure
A	he's really is pretty fluent he's got a pretty big vocabulary erm falls down on prepositions particularly
B	uhu
A	and particles sometimes but I can see an improvement just in the time I've known him and idioms that he likes he tends to remember and it's delightful when he just throws and idiom into the conversation I really like that
B	uhu uhu
A	good
B	it's just yeah really great
B	it just really make me chuckle some of these these er things that they say
A	cool
B	okay bye
A	right there we are yes nice talking again
B	bye
A	oh no find the off button now
