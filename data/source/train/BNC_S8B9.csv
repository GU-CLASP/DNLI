B	it's your house
A	yeah I know I just wanted to make sure it was still here well someone's scratched
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	yeah
B	cos
A	sure mm
B	and she said oh I'm really sorry I said well it would help if you watched your children she goes oh I'll clean I said yeah please do she hasn't
A	bitch
B	yeah it's only pencil it's actually not scratched
A	no
B	made your lists had a productive day at work
B	uhu
A	erm
B	do you want something to drink?
A	mm I'm okay are
B	mm
A	yeah
B	we both shouted at each other but
A	mm mm
B	to be honest I think you deserved because you're messing me around
A	okay well I I think I did as well and I don't think that you did and I'm really sorry
B	well it was reactionary but I'm not sorry I shouted at you because that is exactly what you deserved when you treat people like that
A	mm okay
B	you need to be
A	I'm sorry I shouted at you
B	it's okay
A	and I'm sorry I said that so that's out it's
B	okay it's always good to see people's true colours at times like this
A	I know have you got the AC on?
B	is it hot for you?
A	it is a bit hot yeah it's hot out there
B	yeah it doesn't bother me but
A	mm I mean it doesn't bother me either er actually AC
B	it's quite high now
A	AC in my room's too cold so I just put put it switch it off
B	yeah
A	it's too erm
B	mm
A	it's perfectly fine because the place is so AC
B	no I'm angry with you
A	I know yeah
B	after yesterday I'm upset but maybe that was a good thing for writing the list
A	yeah I think that
B	it was er I haven't held back
A	yeah
B	just get on with it
A	okay okay well basically erm
B	yeah it is
A	yeah
B	I wondered what you were up to
A	yeah so I would rather not do that
B	okay good
A	okay but but it was
B	you've already done it now though
A	yeah I know I've done it for myself but so I'm I'm not going to go through the items but I
B	it sounds like you just want an excuse
A	no I don't want
B	to end things
A	no I don't want an excuse to end things can I just finish?
B	in which case
A	let me finish one second
B	this is pointless
A	no hang on one second I where it is helpful is in organising my own thoughts and just getting to the bottom of how I feel which is obviously a problem for me erm because on Saturday I was
B	exactly
A	you know and and doesn't doesn't want to compromise and
B	yeah
A	there's probably and there's
B	like that first week I was here that was really obvious when I wasn't at work
A	yeah
B	and you didn't want to move your schedule even for one week
A	yeah
B	with your gym and football and this and that
A	or compromise yeah
B	you know it was really kind of like obvious you didn't really want me as part of your life you just wanted to
A	do my thing
B	do your thing in which case why did I move here? we could have just
A	yeah
B	carried on what we were doing before or just ended it
A	yeah well I so what this has led me to conclude
B	mm this is part of the problem
B	that unfortunately you get stuck in your ways
A	yeah I've been alone so long and I've been not involved in a relationship for so long erm that I can't really do it and I all I know is and and it's made me selfish in a way
B	mm
A	because it's made me less
B	I put that
A	yeah cognisant of other people's wants and desires
B	I put that too
A	erm but by the way you know no matter what you think and no matter not withstanding that conversation yesterday I do love and I do care about you and the reason this is difficult for me as well as you is because of the upset that I'm causing you and the reason that I felt like shit for two weeks this is what I wanted to make clear was because I've made you you feel like shit and I knew it and my enduring memory was just seeing you
B	mm
A	so that's
B	mm
A	that's the what I think the
B	I'm always alright
A	I know you're resilient I know you're resilient but I also know that you're very you know er more than you'd like to admit you have got feelings and emotions and
B	mm but I'm much stronger than other people I've realised a lot stronger
A	oh without doubt you're
B	I am
A	yeah well anyway that
B	not that you can't hack it it's you're not prepared to try it's this black or white there's nothing in between for you like it's gotta be like your ideal little world
A	mm
B	perfect relationship which of course doesn't exist for anybody anywhere beyond a couple of days
A	mm
B	or there's nothing there's no in between stage and also that you can't see that things are temporal that you can go through really really good times with someone
A	yeah
B	and then you can go downhill because something's happened
A	mm
B	maybe not even outside maybe just complacency making people lazy and then it can pick up again and that's
A	yeah
B	normal in a relationship it's not like a straight line a relationship
A	I know that
B	it's not even just you start really high and then you go downhill and then you plateau it's not like that if you drew a graph of it it's much more variable
A	mm
B	mm
A	in one way or another in this list whether it might be specific to me to to me and you an incompatibility between us underneath that we've both really glossed over on the way because of the way we are
B	so you're prioritising you need to spend more time alone
A	well the one of it's alone one of it's some of it's with friends some of it's you know meeting new people and doing stuff
B	but this I've already told you so many times
A	yeah I know
B	like cos I can see you're not making any effort
A	I know
B	you haven't made any effort to make new friends in this whole year
A	mm
B	you've met no one
A	mm
B	and you haven't tried
A	that's true
B	and I've asked you over and over again so many times
A	mm
B	for several hours you put aside time to go to football that's not a social event that's a sporting event that involves no talking essentially other than pass the ball oh you dickhead
A	yeah
B	that's a that's not a social activity so that's three nights a week gone
A	yeah
B	and then
A	I know but that's
B	we spend an evening or two together
A	yeah
B	and then usually we see one of your friends you know which have sometimes become mutual friends now
A	mm
A	yeah I know
B	you you didn't make an effort any effort in a year I can't believe it and you say you're really sociable
A	you're right
B	but yet you've even when I've asked you you need to do this
A	yeah I know
B	and it's abnormal you don't know very many people here
A	I think the reason is probably deep down that I don't really feel a connection with
B	but this is a
A	I know
B	counterproductive thing
A	it's exactly
B	because you don't make
A	it's it's
B	friends and you don't they don't invite you places
A	people I don't feel happier
B	and then you don't
A	absolutely
B	have new experiences
A	you're absolutely right
B	then it just becomes like work
A	a vicious cycle
B	gym
A	yeah
B	home
A	and also part of it
B	maybe see
A	yeah and it's
B	you're not doing anything new
A	no
B	even though they're nice people it's not that
A	no
B	they're lovely it's just
A	it's meeting new people it's making the connections
B	you know them and
A	yeah and they
B	yeah
A	live in
B	and they live in
B	and you can't see them every week
A	yeah no I can't well the other thing is erm
B	yeah
A	and seeing this place as a temporary thing
B	yeah I think I felt that too here
A	I
B	that I haven't made a made a lot of effort in
A	mm
B	so
A	yeah
B	in the Middle East that was great that he likes the
A	yeah
A	mm
B	we'd found somewhere completely new and off the beaten track but it was because I made the effort to meet enough people
A	to have that
B	that I ran into people who
A	you liked
B	I got on with and
A	yeah
B	they were fun and we had a lot of fun together whereas here I know my I was kind of thinking six months a year but that's not really excuse like
A	no it's not
B	I had really good fun the other night
A	you've got to enjoy yourself yeah
B	because I was just out meeting new people and it was a nice environment beautiful place they're nice people
A	yeah
B	and I could just do that more it doesn't matter if there's any future in the friendship or not that's kind of irrelevant it doesn't even matter if we meet them again
A	no of course
B	just
A	just get
B	a bit of fun
A	have a chat yeah of course that's how I feel
B	and it was nice to have a drink and relax
A	that's I I enjoyed it
B	yeah
A	that's I I talked to those Korean dudes that were
B	mm
A	working on the project and we just had a really a really good laugh I was getting tipsy very tipsy very quickly
B	mm
A	and I just kept saying things like you're all called
B	I know you told me
A	yeah so this is this is
B	and it's all unilateral again it's like
A	I know
B	we discuss in the caf√©
A	I know
B	for quite a long time a couple of hours there was plenty of time for you to say things it's not like we were shouting at each other and you couldn't speak
A	mm
B	and we discussed things and we analysed and we talked about it and we come to you know at the end of two hours we've come to some kind of agreement and then the next day you had actually changed the date and brought it forward which I was kind of surprised about cos I thought we'd agreed Tuesday not that
A	yeah
B	it mattered it's your flat I mean of course
A	I I think I
B	you're welcome any time
A	I worked out the dates wrong cos I don't
B	so
B	and then the next day you were saying something completely different without discussing anything again
A	oh well I I'd thought about it in myself and I and I was fully intending to discuss it
B	but this is what I'm saying
A	but I was fully intending to discuss it with you it's not like I was gonna announce it suddenly the reason the only reason I told I didn't wanna say anything when I
B	no you said about the cleaner in the morning
A	I know I I said because I didn't want you I
B	but you were the one in the morning saying oh I slept really well I had a great night's sleep
A	because I did I did
B	oh I might bring forward my my time home a day earlier I hope that's okay
A	yeah that's how I started the day now I can explain all of that the sleep I did sleep better and er like is said it was because I was reassured that you were okay that that was the big reason why I felt like shit because I knew that the impact that I had on your emotions not not not mm mm you know not out of spite but because of what I'd
B	what do you mean in my view we didn't discuss it? we didn't discuss it
A	no we didn't discuss it okay we didn't discuss it
B	it's not my view
A	no I know I mean no but you
B	that that's just a statement of fact
A	okay fine we didn't discuss it erm other than you know the breakup conversation
B	well that wasn't really a conversation that was you informing me
A	well and I informed you and then you er you said
B	it was already announced
A	I know it was announced
B	there was no conversation about breaking up
A	I know but I know er
B	we broke up and then there was fallout
A	I know
B	there was no discussion
A	let
B	at any point
A	let me just explain the good night's sleep was because when I saw you on Saturday evening
B	mm
A	your life was going on
B	yeah of course
A	yeah so that that is where that came from and honestly I think that's the the big part of the reason why I felt like shit the the other thing when I said I might bring my was a combination of factors A because earlier in the day I was buoyed and that clouded my judgement about the the fact that my guilt had gone that was the real reason that I felt better it was because I felt less guilty but it wasn't because
B	desperate no why would you
A	no no
B	feel desperate?
A	not not desperate
B	this is an odd word
A	no not desperate not not desperate but because
B	you shouldn't feel desperate
A	mm not desperate but I should feel that I miss being here with you right? that's how I should
B	don't you think it's going to if we move back in together it would be difficult for a while and it's natural that we all feel apprehensive when we knowingly walk into a difficult situation and set ourselves up for that? whereas avoiding stuff
A	I know
B	like you're doing
A	yeah I I
B	is obviously easier even though we feel guilty about it so maybe in the long run the effect is the same you can't get away from these negative feelings if you have any kind of conscience
A	I I agreed
B	so it's not so much that you should feel desperate
A	no
B	to get back here or even excited as you said on the phone
A	no I
B	walking into a difficult situation?
A	but your your heart needs to be in it and my heart
B	well yours obviously isn't because you just said then
A	no
B	I need to pay for oh
A	yeah
B	yet again
A	I
B	decided
A	yeah
B	before the conversation even though even last night you were saying
A	I haven't
B	I haven't decided
A	no
B	I need to talk them through you've already decided
A	no I have yeah I have and and
B	so
A	let me explain so let me explain why
B	again this is pointless
A	hang on no let me explain what I've
B	really it's a waste of time
A	no one second can I just talk?
B	yeah you
A	because because er you know for a relationship to continue it takes two to tango
B	yeah and you clearly don't want to
A	mm not at the moment no
B	there's no at the moment I told you I'm
A	okay
B	not waiting forever
A	fine
B	for you
A	no not forever I I'm not asking for forever
B	not and er yesterday you were like oh we could wait for the summer
[ANNOTATION]	Not all relationships are between 2 people only.	Neutral
A	no yeah well that's
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A mentioned they should be patient until summer.	Entailment
B	come on don't keep
A	that's that's the
B	don't be ridiculous
A	okay well er
B	you expect me to put my life on hold for months for you because you can't make up your mind?
A	okay well
B	you've had six months to think about it already you said
A	yeah and
B	and now you're asking for another three?
A	no that's fine
B	sorry
A	look if you can't wait that's your
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is stalling because he/she needs to decide which work to chose.	Neutral
B	I'm not going to
A	okay well
B	because you obviously don't care and you're making
A	no
B	all these decisions on your own anyway
B	there's no discussion you've just come in having said this discussion is open ended and you haven't decided anything you've now come in and said
A	I
B	the exact opposite
A	I know I'm
B	you've just tripped yourself up
A	no no hang on I mean
B	no you did
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is really angry.	Entailment
A	believe me
B	you just said
A	believe me
B	oh I need to pay oh I only paid up till tonight and
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A asks from speaker B to have faith in him/her.	Entailment
A	yeah I know I have decided
B	I need to pay oh
A	I have
B	but then
A	I
B	on the phone yesterday you said the exact opposite
A	what?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is a non trustworthy person.	Neutral
B	you said this discussion was open ended and you needed to weigh things up and see and blah blah blah
A	yeah I have
B	so
A	yeah but that happens in relationships sometimes one partner wants something that another doesn't
B	yeah so you don't want a relationship so why are we having this
A	no
B	conversation? what is the point?
A	well
B	why don't you just
A	the the point
B	end this conversation?
A	okay well this is what I was gonna propose because ultimately it what what it boils down to is the way forward
B	the way forward is there is no way forward
A	okay so
B	we've just you've just established that
A	yeah er look
B	you don't want to have a relationship
B	you want me to wait indefinitely
A	the reason
B	but actually you've already decided
A	no not indefinitely not indefinitely not indefinitely what I was gonna propose is that both of us
B	mm
A	and to decide that that you don't want it but what I was gonna propose was
B	okay that's weird
A	no but it's not weird
B	it's very weird
A	I need I need but I need thinking time
B	well you're not just gonna have thinking time you've got the rest of your life
A	no but
B	just just draw a line there
A	okay well it's either it's either that
B	there's no
A	what okay well all I'm telling you is I need space I can't make a decision now
B	well you can have all the space for the rest of your life that's fine
A	okay well er or that we end it now and and if we end it now then we
B	end it now
A	okay but
A	well what the the benefit of it is
B	for who?
A	for well for both sides
B	what you keeping me hanging?
B	the benefit of that?
A	that's one way of looking at it but the other benefit of us being apart is that we get the chance to really reflect on what it's like to be without each other and I think
B	mm
A	I haven't
B	I don't need months
A	okay
B	to know that
A	well I haven't had enough time I really haven't because my judgement has been clouded by things like guilt at having that effect on you for two weeks and the reason I don't wanna come back here is that you should take it as I don't want you to take that personally it's not because I don't wanna be you know I don't enjoy being around or
B	but don't you think you're you're when you're on your own your mindset is very unhealthy you get into a very odd thought pattern a not very healthy thought pattern
A	no I
B	most people aren't if they're even a little bit
A	I I'm
B	mentally unstable then it's obviously gonna make them worse being on their own
A	I I've been on my own most of my life
B	yeah it's not always very healthy though is it?
A	possibly possibly that's possibly true but that doesn't mean that you you know you you enter into a relationship at any cost and you have to be
B	but we're not entering into one we were already in one
A	no continuing or or continuing a relationship at any cost
B	it's not at any cost any cost means you know one of us or both of us financially destitute and we can't get work here one of us is abusing the other
A	oh I know
B	one of us is
A	but those aren't the only reasons
B	I don't know stealing from the other
A	no but mm
B	or whatever whatever it is those are at any cost those are extreme circumstances where yes I don't think it is worth continuing at that point no matter how nice the other person is and how fun there is just no point
A	those aren't the only reasons a relationship can't continue
B	but this is the any cost thing if you're gonna go down
A	no
B	that any cost route
A	okay okay well well well well
B	because we're not talking about these big things we're talking about some differences some character flaws
A	the
B	but no one's perfect and
A	no I just
B	and some things that can be fixed and some things can't and that's what needs to be decided are there too many things that can't be fixed?
A	that's my concern
B	but we don't know that if we don't try this is what I'm saying you're not gonna know it by going away and thinking about it for six months
A	yeah I
B	or three months
A	well er
B	or even two months
A	in a way I am in a way I am because in a way that will give me the benefit of hindsight and I'll be able to look back and say how do I feel without
B	well it won't matter how you feel because I won't be there any more
A	okay well
B	you're stringing me along
A	okay well I don't want to
B	okay well
A	okay well
B	proposal over
A	because I at the moment I can't see a future with between us I can't
B	well then there's no point
A	and the reason the reason why I don't know I don't know if it's the selfish me being alone all my life not being able to adjust to a
B	this is what I mean you're just saying these things without trying to fix them that's how you've been approached this whole issue you've just been like oh there are some problems I'm gonna run away and stay in a different place okay I'm just gonna talk about the problem but I'm not gonna do anything about it
A	I
B	this this to me is like it's like research
A	mm
B	but you only ever have a hypothesis what does that prove?
A	I
B	nothing
A	I agree
B	would you do scientific research like that?
A	I
B	oh I've got this great idea for a drug
A	I know but
B	you test it
A	I know
B	then you refine it
A	I know
B	then you test it again and then you refine it this is scientific inquiry and then you might find at the end you know what? this drug quite clearly doesn't work or it doesn't work well enough to make onto the market it's not different
A	yeah
B	you've got a hypothesis
A	yeah I
B	but there's no you're not problem solving with it
A	let me let me just say first of all that I agree with you that I shy away from the difficult emotional issues like I don't confront them that's not really been built into me because my parents are not
B	so what are you gonna do? just repeat that all your life?
A	no I'm
B	where's that gonna get you?
A	okay that's fine er don't be a victim you're right
B	mm
A	okay secondly I have a real fear and I'm just gonna tell you what that fear is that if I move back here now even if it's to er to
B	doesn't matter
A	in the sea
A	it does to me because maybe you don't care about being
B	not really
A	okay well I well that's your right to to that's your right
B	I don't think you've treated me very well so
A	and I can
B	just to remind me of that?
A	and and and and in my and I I'm gonna acknowledge that in my plan to minimise hurt and sugar-coat everything in a bid to hurt you less what's wound up happening
B	but was it
A	no it was
B	to have a chance to reply?
A	no I was always I was always going to
B	to
A	I was always gonna
B	to see that you'd upset me
A	well
B	was it really about that?
A	well it could be well it could be
B	you say it was about me but I can't help wondering was it really about you?
A	whether it was about me yeah but
B	it was just you being selfish again
A	it could well be and and and
B	yeah
A	rather than
B	can you not see how much worse it is?
A	I know
B	that you've strung me along for six months?
A	I know I know
B	and you told all your friends about it and then you told me last how humiliating that is?
A	how how do you know I told all my friends about it?
B	because you told me you did
A	yeah
B	how humiliating that is?
A	yeah I know
B	how hurtful that is?
A	yeah I know
B	and you say you did it to hurt me less it doesn't feel like that
A	and it had the complete opposite result
B	it doesn't feel like that at all do you think it's better to break up with me now? is this a better time? my sister's still got cancer it's gonna get worse not better I
A	I know
B	I need surgery now I'll be on my own
A	yeah I know
B	was it gonna be was it better
A	no it's not
B	waiting six months?
A	it wasn't better that was that was a lesson
B	I could have resigned
A	a big
B	months ago if I'd wanted to do and now I'll have to do a runner if I'm gonna leave
A	that was a big
B	but I'm still on the three you see until September so I could still resign cos I'm on probation still
A	well
B	so I've still got that as a get out option it's just it's not a September it should be a July finish it would be easier for me but these things aren't insurmountable
A	well I mean it's sounding like we've led to down a certain path you don't want to wait at all I
B	I don't want you to string me along any further
A	okay
B	I think you've strung me along enough
A	mm
B	don't you?
B	you can't keep doing this
A	no
B	and messing me around
A	I'm sorry
B	and it's hot cold hot cold it's not fair so
A	no it's not fair
B	that's that and I'm not sure I could ever trust you again anyway given how you've behaved yesterday was the last straw you give people chances
A	I I didn't do that
B	you talk about open and honest
A	it's it wasn't out of malice I wasn't
B	you say all the right things
A	yeah
B	and then you do the exact opposite the next day
A	but it wasn't
B	without discussing things further you just repeat the same thing
A	no but
B	the same behaviour
A	but it wasn't malice it was because I didn't
B	and then you blamed me I pressure you into it I force you that wasn't even true that was just an outright lie
A	yeah
B	no you asked me
A	yeah
B	what do I want? you asked a very open question
A	I did yeah
B	you said
A	I did
B	what do you want to happen next? that's very open
A	yeah yeah
B	it's not like I forced my opinion on you
A	I know but at the time
B	you asked
A	at the time
B	and then you were given
A	but at the time I was in the euphoria of first of all seeing you and secondly in the euphoria of seeing that you were okay because that's a big part of why I've not I've had sleepless nights for over two weeks because I feel like a a perpetrator of crime that's how I feel because of the effect that I've had on you even though I know I've not intended to hurt you but I have
B	of course you have
A	yeah I have
B	and it's been so much worse like this
A	exactly and often in these situations
B	and I feel deceived
A	I know
B	you've deceived me for so long
A	yeah I know but I I I mean no
B	well I don't know with you I don't think you learn
A	I've definitely learned a lot from you that's for sure there there's no doubt in my mind about that I've learnt a
B	yeah she's a terrible person actually
A	mm
B	she's really an awful person at heart that's what she
A	it was
B	it was like a caricature of a person
A	and I've had to deal with that all my life
B	she's a joke
A	the tempers yeah
B	and she's a no good person
A	no and and
B	but
A	that's my mum's fault
B	you guys have created it
B	so
A	and and
B	you're a part to blame
A	you're right
B	your father's created it through his behaviour
A	he has
B	your mother's created it by being weak and not
A	yeah
B	standing up to your father and protecting her daughter and then spoiling her ever since
A	it's true
B	you've created it by spoiling her
A	spoiling her as well you're right
B	she's never ever had to think
A	well
B	where's my money coming from?
A	what do I need to do for myself?
B	how am I gonna pay the bills next week? and that actually would have shook her out of it earlier on it might be too late now
A	yeah you're right
B	I mean she's been doing it for fifteen years
A	and she's
B	never
A	thirty-one
B	she's thirty-one there isn't a whole lot of hope for her I wouldn't say it's impossible
A	no you're right
B	but while she's under the
A	the
B	oh while she's under this environment of you know this unhealthy environment she's living in with your parents there's not much chance of her breaking free and she'd have to be very strong and motivated to want to break free
A	yeah
B	and you're creating it too
A	you're right
B	you pay all the bills and do everything
A	I'm changing things though well I'm changing stuff and it's thanks to you that I'm changing it
B	well it might be too late anyway but anyway
A	yeah it might
B	she's not a nice person
A	no you're right
B	she's poisoning everyone around her
A	you're right
B	so she's dragging them all down and making them all as bad as her
A	suffer with her yeah
B	yeah
A	you're right well
B	she's not someone I want to ever speak to or see again but then I don't have to so that's all good
A	do you feel like that about me?
B	no I don't think you're like your sister you're not the evil stepsister in the
A	no I mean er do you feel like
B	in some Cinderella
A	you never want to see me again?
B	Disney film
A	do you feel like you never want to see me again?
B	I I just don't really feel in love with you after how you've behaved
A	I hope I hope that
B	no I guess the writing was on the wall with you with the trust a long time ago
A	you mean about the
B	yeah you lied to me quite seriously but you said I didn't tell you an outright lie it's the same thing
A	yeah I
B	but you did tell me this won't ever happen again
A	well I was
B	and obviously it has
A	I was a bit shocked by the your reaction though
B	why?
A	that actually I shouldn't have been because
B	it was serious
A	that's that's a that's a normal part of being in a relationship with someone is you plan together again that's something that I didn't register with me cos I've never really been in this situation before
B	but we had planned together
A	I know
B	I was looking for jobs we'd agreed that and we'd
A	I know
B	a course on action and then you were going behind my back
A	I know
B	and you know I'm going
A	I'm not I'm not defending
B	it was all me coming into your camp but you couldn't even respect that you were just off doing your own thing
A	it was about a year ago just over a year ago
B	mm
A	do you
B	no I mean
A	yeah
B	you've messed me around
A	I know
B	you've wasted my time
A	I know
B	you've strung me along these are really bad things but no not in the sense that you were abusive or you didn't care about me in your own way
A	in my own fucked up way
B	no you did really care and you supported me with the doctors and my sister
A	I do really care about you
B	you know those things you've done really well
A	yeah I'm sorry
B	if you did then you'd fight for it but you're a quitter so you don't
A	no it's not that I'm not it's not because I'm a quitter that's not how I see it anyway I know you see it differently but the way I see it is is I feel that there is I mean you know it shouldn't have taken two years but I guess it has I feel that there's a fundamental incompatibility and
B	you feel it you're not prepared to do anything about it
A	but I think
B	this is what I'm saying
A	I I know but we we'd said you can change top five to ten but you can't change the bottom
B	go on let's hear this list what's in the
A	no I don't want to
B	other other eighty?
A	I don't want to do that
B	why?
A	no because it's not
B	you've already written it so you might as well
A	it's not fair
B	don't you think it's worse now that I'll always wonder?
A	you want me to tell you?
B	yeah come on you wrote it
A	let me can I just go to the toilet first? I need to need the toilet
B	are you going to change it?
A	no I'm not going to change it just need to poo and piss that's
B	why don't I read it?
A	no I'll tell it's cos it's not decipherable okay? I'm not
B	tell me
A	okay but let me just okay?
B	sure
A	you really want the
B	you wrote it you brought it
A	only if you give me yours then
B	oh sure you'll be reading a while
B	and it's not very nice but you deserve it it's true
A	it's shit
B	oh yeah I wouldn't have done it if you hadn't insisted yesterday I didn't want to write these lists
A	yeah I didn't want I I didn't want to but only after I thought about it afterwards because I thought why is this?
B	well you did want to you were insisting yesterday
A	yeah I know on the phone
B	on the phone
A	I know I on the phone
B	and I was like I didn't write it
A	I know
B	because I didn't want to
A	well shall we just not please?
B	I want to
A	why?
B	you can't make me wonder all my life
A	okay fine but
B	it's not like I'm planning on staying in contact with you anyway
A	no no because it doesn't make
B	mm
A	we both needed to work on is we both
B	of each other?
A	yes because we're both
B	mm
A	even though we might not
B	mm
A	so I am in dominating everything and being really jealous and possessive and when you and do and stuff you know wanting to know where you are all the time which probably feels quite oppressive to you
B	mm
A	and I feel that you are with me examples
B	mm
A	you're always like who are you texting? you always ask me this question
B	yeah cos you do it when we're in bed together
A	yeah I
B	and that's kind of rude
A	well when am I gonna do it? you know what am I gonna do? get out of bed and do it?
B	yeah but sometimes you do it
A	okay
B	so I am gonna ask you who are you texting
A	all I know is I've felt a little bit constrained by
B	but don't you think that's a normal thing to ask?
A	I've just felt a bit er constrained
B	but don't you think that's a normal question to ask?
B	but it's not about trust it's just
A	I
B	isn't it?
A	it's felt a bit like a lack of trust to me
B	but I reckon you're
A	no but there's others as well
B	yeah but I just think that's a normal question
A	yeah
B	don't you think you're reading a bit much into that?
A	well anyway I'm just all I
B	I just think that's a normal question if you're in a bed with someone and someone starts texting to say
A	but I can't
B	who are you texting?
A	but I can't make up how I feel
B	no I'm just saying
A	okay
B	that maybe you're interpreting this in a weird way and if you're in bed with someone texting
A	yeah
B	it is kind of normal
A	yeah well there's other situations
B	it's not like I'm saying don't text
A	no I know okay then I felt you know the gym thing for example that's just part of my lifestyle
B	yeah but you are inflexible about it
A	I am because it's part of my lifestyle it's not something that I see as
B	and sometimes I really don't see you in the week because
A	I know
B	you don't compromise on the length of time
A	I know or
B	or even moving the day sometimes
A	I know
B	when there's stuff on sometimes we can't move the events you could move your gym
A	I'm sure I have moved
A	but maybe not as often
B	not much
A	anyway
B	so then I asked you once could you not cut your gym session short sometimes so we can maybe eat together or go out to this event together or go for a swim together?
A	mm
B	I've asked you to come to the gym here with me
A	yeah
B	and you've made excuses every single time how many times have we been to the gym here together?
A	probably hardly any
B	once
A	once yeah
B	in a year but you won't compromise at all you see
A	yeah you're right
B	and you're like oh it doesn't have the right weights
A	I am
B	come on
A	I am
B	this is uncompromising
A	no I don't my no but I it's true
B	but this but it's about compromise
A	but for me I know it is
B	if the your reason you have to go is to mentally
A	yeah
B	you won't compromise at all on your
A	I know
B	routine it's just you and that gym at that time it doesn't really feel like I'm in a relationship with someone sometimes
A	mm
B	like it's not I don't understand the needing to mentally switch off and
A	well for me
B	keep fit
A	it's not just switch off it's also yeah I mean it's it's stay sane mentally well stay less insane and in the UK there's all this incidental exercise when you walk everywhere
B	yeah I understand all of that
A	here there's none it's like just in
B	but that's what I'm saying that
A	yeah
B	once a week it would have been nice
A	to do stuff together
B	to do stuff
A	mm
B	go for a cycle ride
A	yeah
B	I mean we've done it so rarely because you insist on doing your way it's always
A	yeah
B	your way it's not like I'm asking you to stop exercising to stop
A	you're right
B	exercising or to exercise less often
A	I am uncompromising
B	very
A	that's like my father
B	yeah very uncompromising
A	yeah and that doesn't lend itself well to relationships
B	no not if you're not prepared to change
A	no
B	anyway carry on
B	yeah this this really worries you that I don't keep in touch with friends very much
A	no not not just worrying you about you
B	oh I see about you?
A	mm yeah it's just that I need time to do that
B	but you can
A	yeah I know but I feel sometimes like I can't
B	why?
A	I don't know it's like the texting
B	sometimes you say I want time to email at the weekend and I say
A	yeah
B	okay and then we both go off on our laptops for a
A	and we do
B	couple of hours
A	yeah that's true that's true no it can be done that can be worked around
B	yeah
A	that that's how
B	that can
A	that's more workable but
B	that other thing you can do is like not come home like you know stay at work and an extra half an hour so that you can make some calls
A	do emails that's true
B	and do emails you know there are lots of ways around that if I'm if you feel interrupted at home because you know I start talking to you and you can't really focus and
A	yeah
B	that's a way around it there are ways round like things like that like staying at work to do work and that's something I could do not bring work home
A	yeah
B	is stay at work an extra hour and finish it off there
A	and then there's things like and this is where it gets to the fundamentals
B	mm yeah this is all kind of nonsensical so far
A	okay
B	it's all kind of superficial stuff you know
A	the the stuff
B	you stuff that could easily be worked on
A	yeah the fundamental is is for me that night at the at the Garcia Marquez event
B	mm
A	which first of all I have to be grateful to you for because I wouldn't have been there unless you'd found it
B	yeah
A	erm I really enjoyed it
B	yeah it was a nice film
A	and and and then at the end I wanted to chat to people and I and I'll do and I could tell that you didn't and I think that
B	well I was probably talking to
A	no I know
B	well we talked to him for like twenty minutes
A	I know
B	while we ate that was nice
A	yeah I know and then when it became more generalised
B	and then after that I thought we were gonna go
A	yeah I know
B	I didn't want to stay till we were the last people there we were literally the last people and you again you wouldn't compromise because I wanted to go you know just have something to eat and then
A	well I mean
B	and that was fine that was nice and we know
A	yeah
B	but then you know it started to thin out and I wanted to go and I told you that
A	yeah
B	but I wasn't allowed to and again I feel like
A	mm well yeah
B	it was uncompromising
A	you felt constrained yes you felt constrained by me
B	you felt constrained and I felt constrained
A	and I felt constrained you we both felt constrained
B	yeah we both felt constrained
A	but this is this is
B	is this fundamental?
A	I think it is
B	is it?
A	I
B	that you wanted to stay an extra
A	no but it's not the extra
B	twenty-five minutes?
A	it's not just the extra
B	and I wanted to leave at that point?
A	but it's more than just that event and the leaving
B	yeah because neither of us
A	it's an outlook
B	can compromise on this
A	yeah
B	but don't you think there is
A	there are
B	there are solutions?
A	yeah well one of the things I was thinking that could have could have potentially worked was
B	exactly
A	or or you getting getting your cab but still for me I'm just telling you how I'd feel
B	and also for me we didn't plan that as a social event
A	I know we didn't plan no
B	so then for me
A	you weren't mentally prepared
B	I wasn't really mentally prepared I was tired
A	no
B	it was an after work thing
A	that's where you're
B	I thought is nice we can watch a film have a bit to eat
A	that's how your mind prepares
B	yeah and you see I like to prepare for things
A	but mine doesn't
B	but you know that
A	yeah I know that about
B	I've told you that before
A	I know that about
B	like it's I'm when I can
A	I know
B	prepare for things I'm okay about it it's when people like force situations of me and I did feel
A	right
B	forced
A	and I felt forced
B	to stay
A	I felt forced to leave
B	but by that stage there were literally two people left
A	no there were a few there was a
B	there were no more than five
A	there was a group no well yeah but I was talking to them
B	and five and four of them were people who'd organised the film
A	I know but I was talking to them and they
B	yeah because you won't compromise
B	I already had compromised
A	I know
B	I thought you'd see at that point
A	yeah
B	that yeah we talked to
A	I had yes
B	up until that point we were all wanting the same thing
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	this is where the compromise started
A	yeah
B	now I thought we'd already compromised cos I hung around
A	but I didn't
B	another fifteen minutes
A	it didn't register in my I know
B	and I'd said to you oh can we go now? and you were like oh
A	now
B	no mm
A	now that now that you now that you put it in that way from your perspective and based on how your mind works I can see it as a compromise at the time my mind didn't
B	but you heard me say can we go now?
A	yeah I know but I couldn't I don't know
B	but you ignored me
A	it's not
B	so then that was the compromise
A	well this is where
B	for me was stayed fifteen minutes and then we left but no you wanted to stay until everyone had left
A	well this is well this is
B	and it and you might might
A	no
B	diplomacy for you
A	no there were others er as well it wasn't just
B	but they were they couldn't leave before everyone do you not see what I'm saying?
A	yeah
B	like until everyone left then they couldn't it was probably a very long day for them too
A	yeah
B	and they wouldn't have minded going home and
A	I but yeah but
B	having a drink and
A	but it isn't it's
B	just chilling out for a couple of hours
A	but this is not just about that event
B	no I'm just saying if you you don't really see this from my perspective you're seeing it all from yours that
A	but it's er
B	you weren't allowed to have entirely your way but what you couldn't see was that I had already made a compromise and I was expecting you to make
A	I know but I
B	some kind of compromise
A	and I
B	but you didn't
A	but I did I left earlier I could have stayed longer
A	I'm telling you
B	anyone left
A	I'm telling you how it felt
B	yeah and then you make me feel bad about it
B	but you did
A	I know well I'm sorry then I don't wanna make
B	I'm sorry too but
A	I'm sorry
B	you didn't really try
A	no
B	to be honest
A	but I legged it out of there
B	but you'd made me wait for so long already by then
A	I know I'm sorry
B	that's how it felt
A	okay well I'm sorry
B	and that's where the compromise was that you know when I said can we go now? you sort of said do you mind if we just stay fifteen minutes? and then stuck to it
A	mm
B	instead you were like no
A	oh well I
B	that's not very
A	I know
B	no no and no timeframe nothing
A	yeah
B	so I felt I had to walk out cos it was the only way to make you go so I stayed like fifteen minutes
A	yeah
B	and you made no sign of
A	I
B	any move or saying are you okay? or checking up on me in fact it got weird cos you started telling really inappropriate anecdotes about
A	yeah sorry
B	which weren't even correct
A	yeah that was
B	you actually made stuff up to make it sound like dramatic so I got to feel even more uncomfortable
A	sorry
B	because I was like it wasn't even correct it was actually a lie and it was really inappropriate to talk about that with Columbians how do you know
A	I know
B	that woman hadn't lost her family to
A	that's true
B	people in the Farc?
A	yeah that's true it was
B	I mean god it was awful
A	totally
B	it was like
A	yeah I know and I
B	the one thing you know about Columbia and you
A	yes you never bring up that stuff
B	yeah
A	I know I'm such a fucking
B	I felt really awkward and it was really inappropriate anyway even
A	I'm sorry
B	if she hadn't been Columbian which she was though we didn't know her
A	her background
B	her background and her thoughts on that but probably weren't very positive
A	mm
B	and then you said they were friends
A	yeah
B	it was a business thing
A	yeah
B	so it was completely wrong
A	sorry
B	and then
A	sorry
B	it was really odd even if she hadn't been Columbian though it would have been weird because it was a story I told you in private
A	yeah I know
B	a private anecdote and then you
A	just
B	come out with this stuff to random people
A	and you were uncomfortable in that situation anyway and then to it makes it
B	so you made me feel really uncomfortable
A	I'm sorry
B	and even then you wouldn't leave you didn't care
A	I didn't know at the time
B	you did know
A	erm
B	as soon as we went to the car park you said I shouldn't have said that should I about the
A	I I no all I
B	and I said yeah because it wasn't even correct and it wasn't even true
A	but I just saw that you were really annoyed and I
B	but you knew cos you said it yourself
A	I knew the I knew the bit about the
B	so
A	hey erm but the the the this is
B	I know this is one issue but I'm just explaining it to you from a different perspective
A	I know
B	and you obviously hadn't even considered it
A	I know
B	from another perspective why
A	yeah
B	that I might have been annoyed
A	but I don't think you
B	that you hadn't compromised
A	well I don't
B	at all
A	but you didn't seem
B	like you didn't seem to care
A	but you it's
B	and then you told this weird inappropriate story
A	I know I'm sorry
B	that made everyone feel uncomfortable
A	I'm sorry
B	that wasn't even a true story
A	I that's putting my feet
B	you just
A	foot in it all
B	exaggerated and made up stuff
A	I have a tendency
B	to make yourself look good and it didn't it just looked terrible and
A	I know
B	you know possibly made that woman feel awful as well
A	true
B	how do you know she didn't lose her brother?
A	you're right
B	or cousin?
A	you're right
B	I mean she might well have done
A	that's true I I have a tendency like my father unfortunately of putting my foot in in it in social situations and basically ending up offending people but but you didn't see what happened after you'd left which was
B	no
A	no I know but erm I mean no I'm not saying it literally I'm just just telling you what
B	yes so you had to leave
A	what what happened
B	yes
A	no no so so I was there one minute chatting to people and then I was looking around for you at the same time I was caught between the social situation and trying to
B	mm
A	make sure you were okay and where you were and then we you know we moved onto another group of people and
B	that's okay I mean there was hardly anyone
A	I know
B	there
A	but
B	it's not like you left
A	but
B	at you know it's not like you walked into a party
A	no I know
B	said sorry gotta go after just eating the free food
A	I know
B	I mean you know what I mean?
A	I know that but the way I felt
B	it it wasn't like that
A	no but the way I felt what I felt as opposed to the way you felt and we feel very differently about these situations is I felt like I was I was being pulled away
B	well the no but you didn't even when I told you I wanted to go
A	I know
B	you still er wouldn't
A	I know
B	compromise
A	I know
B	this is what annoyed me
A	but this is
B	that you didn't seem to care
A	this is where this we come to the crux of it this is where it's the fundamentals it's not about
B	but then that's you
A	about
B	it's all your way can you not see that? that there was a middle way it didn't have to be all my way
A	yeah
B	and it didn't have to be all
A	all my way
B	your way it had to be in the middle
A	somewhere in between
B	we had to say
A	but
B	let's go within fifteen minutes and then mean it
A	I know but I
B	what? this is what I mean
A	because that's how our social life is
B	this is
A	no
B	of you
A	no but
B	you shouldn't be in a relationship then
A	no well that's how I am maybe maybe what needs to happen is that maybe you need to be with somebody who has
B	well I need to be with someone who cares yeah
A	no I
B	because it doesn't seem like you care
A	no I do
B	I that's what I felt that night you really didn't care about me it was only about you and you wanted
A	no that's not true
B	it is true you just said it
A	that's not
B	I need to be with someone
A	hang on I no but
B	who actually cared
A	no it's not cared can I finish my sentence? you need to be with somebody who has a
B	no
A	it's gonna minimise those situations yeah
B	you're I need to be with someone who cares enough to compromise on what they want and meet someone halfway that's what I need I don't need someone identical to me
A	no not identical
B	that's boring anyway
A	but it it
B	and it's not good for you
A	no I did
B	I need someone who is prepared to compromise
A	yeah to
B	to meet me hallway
A	but
B	not to have everything his way
A	I know
B	and you do and it's unfair
A	I know
B	you say you don't want people to you know be a complete pushover with you and you don't respect them but the truth is they do have to be a pushover for you they have to do everything your way
A	you're probably right
B	what kind of relationship that will you be happy really?
A	so in that case
B	will you ever be happy?
A	I'd better not be in a relationship
B	well I think no the better thing there is to realise that you're going about things the wrong way
A	but I can't that's my personality
B	you can't no can't
A	it's my personality
B	can't that's not a real word
A	it's my personality
B	can't is something like you can't fly it's physically impossible
A	I know you wanna use this the you variant of that word
B	no
A	I'm
B	but you can't change? that's really defeatist these are only little things we're talking about that and it's it's how you were brought up your mum really spoilt you as well she did that
A	well I don't
B	Arab thing where she let you have your own way you know
A	possibly
B	take
A	it's true
B	look what she's done to you as an adult
A	she's turned me into a lunatic
B	well she's turned you into a selfish
A	bastard
B	man
A	yeah you're probably
B	who can't compromise and realise that he can't have everything his own way that's what she's taught you
A	you're probably right
B	with er Arab parenting
A	how's that how's that gonna change after thirty-three years?
B	consciously
B	a victim all your life?
A	no not a victim no
B	because
A	no I'm not but I'm not
B	are you too?
A	no I'm not a victim
B	but you are with this you're saying it can't change it's impossible of course it's not impossible
A	no but but
B	it's about recognising situations like that and analysing it and then thinking what should have happened there? what should I have said what should we have said? and next time when someone says it I'm going to try and remember okay I'm gonna say fifteen minutes I'm gonna say half an hour I'm gonna say whatever but I'm gonna say a number and then I'm gonna stick to it and not have a go at the person
A	I know but
B	afterwards
A	I know it's
B	for coming to a compromise and dragging me away no and realising that
A	but that's how I felt
B	but this is what I'm saying
A	so
B	I know we don't always put it as as a time but don't you see that sometimes we need to?
A	I see it as open ended yeah well you need to
B	or fifteen minutes twenty minutes half an hour whatever
A	you need
B	I'm just saying fifteen minutes but
A	if we'd done the timer
B	I'm saying a number
A	if we'd done the timer and agreed it the fifteen minutes and then I'd found well I'm actually still enjoying this I so you know what why don't you go home? but then it was my
B	I think that is rude
A	yeah but
B	yeah
A	yeah but then but then I can't deny how I felt I was
B	but yeah you can
A	enjoying being there
B	but that's okay I'm
A	yeah
B	you had enjoyed yourself for let's say twenty minutes half an hour whatever the timeframe was we agreed
A	mm
B	and at that point you think great I've had a really nice time you think about it that way
A	mm
B	not I had to stay you know another half an hour and do you know what I
A	yeah but I still
B	I'm going out to a bar tomorrow I really wanna meet people
A	but yeah I know I know I know that's one of the things is that we need our definitely needed to have our own social lives
B	yeah
A	that involved meeting new people and not being there together
B	yeah true
A	I think that was important for both of us
B	yeah and I did tell you to do that a lot
A	you did but I didn't realise its importance until now
B	yeah that's a pity
A	and then
B	cos I did tell you that you need to do it once a week
A	yeah
B	away from me and you didn't
A	the other thing is I did feel like we were around each other too too much like we were too
B	yes
A	did too much together
B	I agree but this is
A	we were forced
B	again and again I told you you need to go out once a week and you never did
A	no I know this is really important
B	and I knew this
A	I'm gonna learn I'm gonna learn the lesson but
B	I did know that
A	yeah I didn't
B	that I need to make more effort too but not cos I really needed to but I could see that you needed to
A	mm and then
B	I really did ask you a lot of times to do that
A	I know you did and I didn't really I didn't realise and then erm you know erm sometimes there's
B	yeah I think that's healthy actually
A	that I didn't have time to do when when when we were together
B	but you say you didn't have time but again it's
A	or I didn't make time
B	exactly not having time
A	I didn't make time yeah
B	is
A	yeah
B	is not true not making time so and also that you need to do those things on your own like you hardly ever went fishing did you? you've been like three times in a year you could have done that a lot more
A	yeah
B	or drawing or whatever you could have
A	yeah
B	just driven yourself somewhere and
A	I know
B	started to draw
A	but
B	but don't you see that this is you?
B	you didn't make time
A	yes
B	you didn't take make the effort
A	you're right
B	I encouraged you to go fishing
A	you did
B	to hang out with your friends
A	you did
B	and also we both needed a wider circle cos you hardly know
A	we
B	anyone here and I knew more people than you
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b did everything they were saying	Entailment
A	yeah you did
B	but not not really as like close friends cos I'm hanging out with the wrong people you know the walking group's nice cos it's here and
A	yeah I know
B	but
A	I think all of it
B	I needed a a wider group you know to go out in a bar with people I actually liked and well maybe I wouldn't like them but the point is a a wider group so there was a higher
A	yeah
B	percentage of me finding
B	a probability of
A	of finding people that you like
B	finding people I
A	yeah and and I think that all of these issues could have been made better if both of us weren't the deferential type that would would you know kind of put up with things and not raise doesn't wanna er you know avoids conversations to
B	but now it's come to a head
A	yeah I know
B	what's amazing for me is you're just gonna go that's enough
[ANNOTATION]	they agree that, the more people, the more chances to find someone you like	Entailment
A	no but there are
B	that's amazing for me cos to me we just kind of gone through that list and said I'm sorry but there's nothing there really
A	no there is
B	that couldn't be
A	no
B	worked on go on
A	there is
B	well you haven't got to it yet
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a wants to contradict speaker b	Entailment
A	that's it it's that for me it's the
B	because all of this seems to be kind of like you haven't had enough time to do things that's not actually true you haven't made enough time to do things
A	okay
B	solution you make enough time to do it
A	yeah
B	you don't compromise on your things that's quite serious
A	no but it's the character trait
[ANNOTATION]	it's not about having time, but about making time	Entailment
B	and it's a problem
A	it's a character trait
B	well you say it's a character trait not being able to compromise
A	no no not the
B	but I don't think that is actually a fixed character trait
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is afraid of commitment	Neutral
A	no it's not not no that that's not fixed but it's also just the difference between us socially okay? that's how it is it's
B	mm
A	sometimes I get a real buzz
B	yeah
A	from being around other people and I I
B	yeah I can see that but again we didn't have to do everything together and that's actually a problem doing everything together so I think you could have
A	yeah
B	done some of this stuff on your own
A	I could have
B	and
A	although although although I did
B	that instead of trying to do everything together
A	but I did there were
B	did you?
A	yeah there were occasions
B	when?
A	when when I'd meet friends that er at events that I'd invite you to such as
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah but other situations as well where I felt I did feel like
B	mm
A	but
B	maybe a bit too much?
A	well
B	that's not actually that healthy to be
A	yeah that's true
B	bit too much in each pockets
A	that's true I and I think that's the problem with
B	but actually it would have been good at least once a week for us not have been doing stuff together
A	I mean
B	and I don't mean the gym I mean
A	yeah I know
B	socially
A	I you're right but er the way I felt about it at the time was I've invited her I know along I know she doesn't like these events so I have to respect what she wants but I feel like there's something missing here
B	mm
A	and I'm wondering how she is feeling even though that that wonderment wonderment was unfounded because you were perfectly fine but it it does it I still felt like there was something missing for me
B	mm
A	and I I and I think that
B	yeah
A	he sometimes and she doesn't get it she's she sees it as
B	but I did get it with you
A	you did get it yeah I know
B	I said it to you so many times
A	no you did get it you did get it
B	I did get it and then you didn't do it
A	yeah you do get it and I I know but
B	it wasn't like I didn't get it
A	but that but that doesn't change how we're underneath as people
B	you seem to want us to do everything together and you've just said that that's not healthy
A	it's not healthy but you did too
B	no I didn't want to do everything with you
A	that's true no you didn't
B	I would rather you had done some of those
A	other
B	stuff on your own so that I didn't have to go to those events like you know like
A	no
B	what what was the point? you would have liked it
A	that's true
B	and you would probably have liked it more
A	but you but there was a
B	had I not been there
A	there was a talk though
B	yeah I know the talk was really interesting
A	no it was interesting
B	no I'm I'm just saying things like that we didn't have to do those things together
A	and I'm really grateful and you know and I'm really grateful at the er for the events that you got me involved in
B	yeah I wish you'd done more of the things that I'd suggested
A	yeah
B	there was so much stuff that we could have done
A	there was
B	that would have been fun and we would have met new people but you just always were like making excuses not to do it
A	yeah I know
B	every time I suggested
A	yeah you're right
B	er something other than a talk or a film you would like make an excuse
A	you're right
B	they are the only things you wanted to do and they were not good events for meeting people I enjoyed them but
A	yeah you're right it had to be the premise had to be meeting people
B	yeah or at least we had to alternate not always do the same thing
B	yeah that was nice
A	I thought it was great and you really
B	that was really nice
A	got me involved and it was
B	yeah no I enjoyed doing that
A	me too erm and I enjoyed the events that you got me to go to erm
B	yeah they were nice
A	the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	that's been really good
A	and you spotting all the
B	I think there's nothing on your piece of paper that can't be solved but you've already made your decision
A	there's well there's
B	so
A	there's two options
B	I don't really understand
B	this stringing me along
A	no okay well that's the thing
B	thing
A	cos there's there's there's two options there's we don't have contact
B	I'll just think I need to move on
A	yeah
B	I can't hang on
A	I know
B	any more
A	I yeah I know that exactly
B	that's not fair
A	yeah I know it's not
B	so I just to just draw a line
A	I know
B	at least by the end of this month and say but there's no point waiting until the end of this month because I'm going away for seven weeks like if you're gonna try and sort things out it needs to happen in the next month and it's a good trial period it's perfect weather and a month is about right
A	I can't do that
B	and if you can't again
A	I can't do it
B	you see? this word
A	well I can't I don't feel ready to do it and I I honestly I'm really and it's not just
B	it doesn't matter
A	it to me it does
B	it doesn't
A	I
B	why?
A	because I love you that's why and and and I value
B	if you loved me then you would try
A	no and I value the friendship you
B	but there isn't gonna be one
A	well
B	because you're not a fighter and you don't really care
A	no
B	this is how I feel if you cared about me really instead of some lovey-dovey nonsense that you seem to be giving me then you would fight for it at least try
A	yeah well maybe that's indicative then of
B	maybe that is
A	that
B	true
A	that
B	but I think your language
A	that much is clear
B	is is like indicative of that
A	well
B	yeah
A	that much is clear what's not clear is
B	I think it's you
B	honestly?
A	but but in but in either case in either case whether it's me or us erm no one is to blame here you're not to blame the language I've heard from you recently and and the language I'm still hearing from you is is almost as if to assuage your guilt about about feeling that you might not have done enough nobody's no one's done anything wrong here well you know there may be differences of opinion about that with you but you've not done anything wrong I don't want you to feel like
B	oh I'm very capable of moving on don't worry
A	yeah I know and
B	so this is it like you can't keep stringing me on for months and months and months you've already done it enough so this is it there's a month to sort it out don't leave it till the night before and say the night before my flight and say oh actually I want to sort it out now no if you want to try and sort it out this is it
A	I
B	it seems to me like you don't want the relationship to carry on because you don't see a future that's what that really comes down to
A	it it it's
B	whatever the reason is
A	I wouldn't I wouldn't have broken up if I if I didn't if I felt
B	and why you seem to need to to plan this future ahead so carefully I find odd
A	what future?
B	exactly
A	I'm not worried about it
B	it's well
A	I'm not worried about it but I'm worried about stringing you along I don't wanna do what
B	stringing me along is
A	but
B	if you don't love someone
A	no but can I?
B	and you don't care about them
A	it's more
B	and
A	it's more than that no it's more than that it's more
B	in
B	and he's gonna stop her having children
B	and he's two-timing her come on I mean if that's not stringing someone along
A	two three four yeah he's
B	then I don't know what is
A	yeah
B	but are you like that?
A	yeah
B	yeah you're not like that so
A	and that's why
B	don't you think that's not a fair comparison to yourself?
A	no
B	that he's the
A	no but
B	you know
A	I don't wanna be like that
B	he's stringing her
A	don't want to
B	along in the worst possible
A	yeah
B	way
A	he is he's a selfish bastard and fundamentally after everything I've done to support him when his grandma died who do you think was the first person he called?
B	yeah I know
A	cos he's got fuck all else
B	but I told you this that he's a good friend while you don't need anything
A	yeah absolutely
B	and you just
A	I haven't spoken to him
B	if you want someone to have a laugh with he's your man
B	he's gonna be
A	something serious don't don't go for it
B	don't don't bother
A	yeah
B	that's not what he's for and if you need someone
A	you're absolutely right
B	who's a better friend then that then make someone who's a better friend
A	yeah
B	but
A	you're right
B	that doesn't mean you should drop contact with him you just needed to recognise who he is
A	yeah
B	er what you're dealing with and that he's not gonna change for you just because you do it for him mm he's not gonna reciprocate
A	you're right
B	he doesn't feel any need to
A	yeah you're right erm the
B	but that doesn't mean you
A	yeah you're right the other thing
B	well yeah clearly
A	yeah we both have problems with trust and
B	but I think mine have been quite justified in this relationship to be honest
A	I
B	oh come on
A	causation and look at who's
B	you applied to
A	no I don't wanna
B	jobs in a different country
A	yeah
B	without telling me
A	fine
B	when we'd arranged a plan
A	but
B	that I would
A	the
B	move here and and the only reason I found out is cos
A	okay but your trust
B	it's the same with stringing me along for six months
A	I know
B	the only reason I found out is cos I asked you outright
A	yeah but I told you I was always planning to explain to you why I'd waited that long
B	six months is a long time come on
A	yeah it is a long time but you're your mum was here you didn't break up with
B	no but that was
A	for the same reason
B	that was a week
A	fine
B	not six months
A	your mum was here a week no fine but then there was your sister's news and I felt it felt like the wrong time and I spoke
B	but there was never gonna be a right time
A	and I suppose
B	when someone gets cancer
A	I know
B	it
A	I know
B	she was gonna get better all of a sudden?
A	no she wasn't but but it first broke and
B	yes that would have been insensitive
A	yeah
B	but again but I mean again a couple of weeks or a month but not six months
A	I know yeah
B	it's been going on and on
A	I know that was
B	yeah
A	that's what I'm learning from this whole experience
B	but you don't want the relationship to continue so it can't
A	did you wanna give me my list?
B	but the point is you don't want to work on it
A	I I don't feel that now is the time to work on it no that's how that's how I feel
B	this is the perfect time to work on it how
A	no
B	how can it not be?
A	because I don't want us to I don't want us to end what's been a very fulfilling and enjoyable relationship
B	are you scared again?
A	yeah I'm scared yeah I'm scared I don't I'm
B	it's easier to move on if you don't like them actually
A	I that's how you view it
B	well it is trust me
A	to me to me because you don't
B	but don't you think I already have?
A	yeah I know you've lost respect for me
B	I've lost respect for you for not fighting
A	yeah well the the but this is how I
B	so if you fought for it
A	okay but if I felt
B	I'd actually respect you more
A	but if I felt differently then I would be fighting for it but you you what you need to recognise is this is indicative of how I feel
B	but you are saying you love me on the one hand and you
A	I do
B	and you care about me
A	yes
B	and there were
A	and I do
B	so many things that were right about the relationship
A	there were so many things
B	but you you're not prepared you were able to then go through and see how things can be different on that list
A	yeah apart from apart from the fundamentals
B	well what you
A	no the reason okay what that means is I find I mean you know I find myself I found myself looking forward as a as a taking the Columbian thing
B	but that's because we spent too much time together
A	possibly er possibly I don't know that's
B	but don't you think that's normal in a relationship too?
A	all I know is my judgement about things
B	none of those were very powerful reasons
A	not to you but they they are to me
B	none of those were very powerful
A	okay not to
B	they are all things that could have been sorted out and they were all things nearly all of them were things I'd already suggested and asked you repeatedly to do
A	if I mean if if you plan
A	to come back to
B	yeah
A	if your plan is to come back then what's wrong with
B	I think I've been strung along enough
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
B	don't you?
A	well that's how you view it then then we have to end it we have to end it because
B	yeah
A	I don't wanna string you string you along any more
B	yeah that's that then
A	I just hope I just
B	we've got to draw a line under it
A	yeah I just hope I just
B	you've already pushed me around over the last twenty-four hours
A	I'm sorry
B	this way that way
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	I'm sorry
B	I'm not gonna wait
A	I know
B	until September
A	I don't want I don't you to intuit
B	well August and erm
A	okay I don't want to you to intuit
B	you know kind of hope and then you say oh actually
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about month	Neutral
A	well this is the thing no no no this is the thing it would be wait with no guarantees that the position will change but it's to just give allow us both of us
B	I think you should know to be honest
A	but
B	you've thought about it for six months if you don't know by now I don't know what's wrong with you
A	okay well maybe there's something wrong with me
B	you should know
A	yeah well I I
B	and you've also now had on top of that six months where you just didn't tell me
A	I eighty
B	and you were planning to break up with me
A	I eighty to ninety percent know but when you
B	you sound like we're we're committing our
A	no but look it's the hardest decision I've ever had to make it really is if I if it wasn't I wouldn't have this all this shit going on
B	well what's annoying me is you won't even try and fix these things that's what annoys me you're able to
[ANNOTATION]	person B is annoying because they don't try it	Entailment
A	well because
B	articulate some things that aren't right I agree with you
A	yeah but
B	those those are valid points but what you're not prepared to do is try that's what annoys me
A	couldn't couldn't yeah but
B	and when you're not prepared to try then there's no hope
[ANNOTATION]	they don't have enough hope	Neutral
A	the way I see it though is is that the fundamental incompatibility thing about how we are socially is something that can work
B	well let's give up then
A	can be well hang on can be worked on to an extent but can't be resolved that's how I feel
B	can't but won't try
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about socially something	Neutral
B	that's the what it comes down to
A	no it's not that and I also don't wanna have a little bit of a go like this for a month when I'm
B	mm yeah that was kind of inappropriate of you
A	yeah but that's how I felt I couldn't help it that's how I felt it would be wrong of me to come back here even though the timing you as you say would have been great and blah blah blah it would be wrong of me in that state of mind to come back here with my judgement clouded about things and really knowing that I'm eighty to ninety percent feeling that it shouldn't continue to come back try and give things a go still have those same reservations that I've
B	why is it wrong to try?
A	no hang on at this time because I feel I feel like I'm still I've still got the reservations in my head I've still got a lot of complex stuff going on and I don't want I don't wanna do that to you I don't wanna that would be
B	this is worse
A	negligent
B	what you're doing
A	fine in that case we have to draw a line and I don't wanna if you feel like taking time out from each other for three months
B	don't string me along even longer
A	fine fine that's
B	you've strung me along long enough
A	okay let's not do it then let's not let's we the
B	that's not fair
A	okay I
B	and you can't behave like that
A	and by the way the
B	I did
A	I know
B	up to a point once you did that thing with the jobs I never fully trusted you again
A	okay
B	because you really deceived me then
A	okay
B	so to be honest yeah I never fully trusted you again
A	well I'm sorry
B	that was a really big deal but I guess it was good that
A	there was some
B	I didn't trust you fully
A	there was stuff that was a big deal to me though
B	like what?
A	which like
B	like
A	no okay alright let's leave that now for for now
B	and I don't know how many times I can tell you
A	okay
B	tell you the same thing and I told you
A	okay I'm sorry
B	speak to him
A	okay I'm
B	but you think we've got some kind of conspiracy theory going on
A	I'm sorry okay I
B	where we've worked out some story that
A	okay can I just
B	we'll
A	can I just say what I was gonna say?
B	go on
A	which is which is that that when I erm when I erm first told you how incredibly unhappy I am at
B	mm
A	the reaction I was expecting this is this is this is the truth the reaction I was expecting was oh you know sorry to hear that
B	mm
A	what do you think you can do to make things better? the reaction I got was oh for fuck's sake you know you know oh
B	I still do feel like that
A	yeah
B	about it because
A	okay
B	you never spoke to them about the problem what the issues were
A	it couldn't
B	you never you never gave them a chance and some of it was quite minor stuff that they could have fixed like there was an issue with where you were placed in the office
A	it was it
B	it was so noisy and it was awful
A	well let me let me
B	and you can't possibly
A	no
B	do your work like this was
A	I'm really
B	kind of fixable
A	I I'm really no it was not can I just explain?
B	the office thing was fixable
A	can I just explain that I'm so glad I left that company?
B	yeah I think
A	I would
B	you did the right thing
A	and I would never have been happy there
B	but I still think they had a right to know
A	and he did er tell me my boss's boss he said you should have told somebody we would have made
B	yes
A	yes he said that and then I said but
B	mm
A	it's how a
B	yeah
A	if
B	and they couldn't have changed that
A	and so I feel a lot of parallels with the current situation
B	I'm just saying you didn't give them a chance and like you are not giving me a chance now this seems to be your MO
A	giving a chance
B	that you
A	giving giving a
B	giving them a chance to respond
A	yeah but giving no okay
B	giving at least
A	I wanna give you
B	they have a right to know
A	I know you have a right to
B	and I had a right to know
A	yeah you did have a definitely have a right to know
B	and I I didn't know
A	you did you definitely had a right to know and and that's something that I
B	and really I feel
A	I regret
B	deceived
A	do you feel like you've you've had six months of your life wasted?
B	yeah
A	I'm sorry
B	I thought one thing
A	no we were getting on well
B	you just said
A	yeah I know but but but I know
B	so it was all an act it was all a waste of time
A	what I wanted to get to was when you said I trusted you before and I felt that the implication there was I can't I'm gonna struggle to er ever trust anyone or
B	oh it's not anyone it's you
A	I know yeah it's me I know but
B	because you've been really deceitful actually not just once but twice in the relationship
A	yeah
B	it's not fair on the other person
A	do you wanna give me feedback then about how shit I am?
B	not really
A	cos it will help me
B	you're can if you want
A	why don't you tell me? holy shit you've written a fucking
B	I wrote pages okay so the first
A	you you've written a fucking
B	the first one we've already we've discussed a lot of this okay so it's not being supportive when I suggest networking events like where we meet new people
A	mm
B	like
A	can I be devil's advocate sometimes?
B	blah blah blah but yet you expect me to support you at your events
A	can I be devil's
B	okay go on
A	you keep saying you know that about me and stuff it's true but sometimes
B	about this?
A	no yeah about this this yeah
B	this point?
A	yeah this point
B	you didn't know that?
A	no I did know that
B	oh okay
A	yeah but hang on I'm just being devil's advocate
B	mm
A	you keep saying that you should know that about me or
B	no it's not that you should know it's that
A	yeah you do know
B	you did know
A	yeah I did know but then there are still you assume that I'll know exactly what's going on in your head all the time and I don't
B	no I know that but in this particular case this one you did know about this
A	so definitely
B	and we did discuss it
A	compromise and
B	yeah
A	and being a bit more considerate towards other people's feelings
B	but also that you would have enjoyed these things
A	yeah but let me just say
B	you would have met new new people
A	that's true
B	you would have liked that
A	oh for sure but can we?
B	it would have made our relationship better
A	it would have being more considerate towards people
B	yes
A	it's
B	supporting them
A	supporting them and exactly and understanding
B	and meeting them halfway
A	where they're coming from exactly is something that I need to work on what I think
B	cos you didn't do anything social that I wanted to do
A	you're right what I think I need
B	we had
A	it was quiet she's lovely I really like her
B	she is lovely but we didn't do any of these things these group things ever
A	this is true
B	I think I did say that
A	no I I know but what you do is you get upset or you know you internalise it and then you walk off where you with with whoever it is you have your next relationship with I think you need to be a little bit more bold and a little bit more direct about how you're feeling inside so that that there's no doubt as to
B	mm
A	as to how you're
B	okay can we move on?
A	that person that person has no doubt
B	cos this all about me now and
A	sorry
B	this is supposed to be about you
A	supposed to be about me
B	erm number two accusing me of lying about supposed
A	I'm sorry about that
B	relationships and
A	yeah
B	repeated accusations about the same person or people or situation it's not just once you say it it's repeated
A	this is true
B	over like more than two years now
A	it's insecurity
B	it's weird er getting angry or upset if I don't explain where I am every minute of the day
A	mm
B	and then making insinuations
A	I'm sorry
B	like when I say I was at the supermarket
A	that's an
B	you then make insinuations that perhaps I was with some guy that's weird
A	mm I know the insecurity again
B	that's very odd okay er four is related to this phoning repeatedly when I don't answer instead of waiting for me to call back again
A	yeah
B	because you are so insecure I mean
A	that's true
B	obviously I can see on the phone that you've called so there's no need to call me another five times
A	this is true
B	cos I can't either I can't answer the phone cos I'm in the middle of doing something or I don't want to but either way I know that you've called and you've already sent a message to say whatever can you call me when you're free? that's it you don't need to do it again it's annoying and so all of er
A	and oppressive
B	so it's annoying and it's oppressive and it means you don't trust me which doesn't make me feel good about myself er five is related to
A	or about trusting me
B	these are all about trust I've put that together
A	or or about trusting me
B	trusting yourself
A	yeah no or
B	mm I didn't really see it like that it was just you don't trust me
A	okay
B	refusing to give me the internet password or see the bills for the house erm not letting me pay the half bills half the bills as a result again it was about trust you don't trust me to have an internet password you give me various excuses
A	no the the bills thing
B	about it
A	the bills thing was chivalry it wasn't trust the
B	but don't you think it I wanted to pay them? but I
A	I know you did
B	asked you a lot of times
A	I know
B	and it wasn't a lot of money come on look at the part of the world
A	I know you did
B	we're in where
A	I know yeah
B	you know water's dirt cheap
A	exactly that's exactly
B	I didn't mind if
A	well that's exactly right
B	I I paid half
A	yeah I didn't mind
B	and I would've felt more comfortable
A	I didn't mind if I paid it all
B	paying all of them
A	I didn't mind if I paid them all
B	I know you didn't mind but there was an inequality there and it wasn't very much money was it? but anyway refusing to give me the internet password and not letting me see the bills
A	yeah
B	never mind paying the bills
A	yeah the
B	it's a trust thing
A	phone on my mobile phone
B	you can email them
A	I check the
B	there's an email
A	no it's not it's a the banking app so I log in I go into the the little
B	it doesn't matter you can just show me
B	this is the bill when I ask it's not a big deal
A	I know but like it was
B	okay but the internet password thing
A	that's not a one
B	is weird
A	but that's my password for email and I think it's
B	okay but again we established that you can just
A	I could have changed it
B	change the password
A	okay that's minor
B	so that's not
A	it's not a big deal
B	mm it doesn't make me feel
A	but the other stuff
B	very comfortable in the house though when I'm not allowed to to see these very basic things related to household
A	true
B	normal household running I don't really feel I'm part of the house
A	mm
B	I feel like I'm a visitor in the same way you wouldn't show your mother the gas bill because she's visiting I felt like a visitor because of that
A	yeah I'm sorry
B	it's okay erm and the next one is the last one on the trust thing sticking to me like limpet when we do socialise
A	yeah
B	and refusing to leave me to socialise when I ask
A	yeah
B	we would both be happier doing that but
A	but you didn't tell me this
B	I did tell you that
A	when?
B	and you said I can't I can't leave you
A	when did you tell me leave you?
B	I told a couple of weeks ago I remember discussing this for a start
A	couple of weeks ago?
B	yeah and you said
A	that was when we broke up
B	and when I asked you okay
A	that's when
B	three weeks ago I don't know
A	where were we?
B	here in the house I think and you said I can't though I just can't do that I feel really bad and I said what do you mean can't?
A	no I thought you
B	of course you can
A	I no but I thought that was meant as in you leave me at home and then you go off and do your thing
B	no
A	you meant at the social
B	yes
A	okay I didn't know that
B	you're like a limpet
A	I didn't maybe I am yeah you're right
B	anyway all of those I've put in a group called
A	trust
B	you don't trust me
A	yeah that's
B	and there's quite a lot of things
A	that's true
B	so if you don't trust me then
A	have you got a contents page?
B	no I put those together to make it easier though okay these the next ones are all related to socialising so that was the first of the socialising one but it was also the end of the trust so on the socialising front dominating conversations when we socialise instead of allowing me or others to speak
A	I agree
B	you do that quite a lot and the when you don't get to dominate the conversation you complain you're not allowed to talk
A	yeah
B	but actually
A	I am the domineering
B	you are allowed to talk
A	but you do that too
B	you know when we did that
A	when you talk
B	taping the conversation thing?
A	when you talk it you it I think we can't talk to the same people at the same time
B	no but you know yeah that's true well I'm nervous
A	unless it's
B	I talk too much
A	yeah
B	as well
A	it just keeps going it's like a way of filling the void
B	yeah that's overcompensating when I'm nervous though
A	but we doesn't well it doesn't happen with people like
B	no it doesn't happen with
A	yes
B	or
A	yeah exactly
B	that wouldn't happen okay discussing inappropriate and embarrassing topics in front of other men with me
A	yeah that's true
B	they are all people I don't know well for example
A	yeah like the prostitutes yeah
B	prostitution porn
B	wanking your
A	yeah sorry yeah
B	previous sexual encounters
A	sorry
B	so those things make me feel very uncomfortable
A	I know it's horrible
B	and when I'm already feeling a bit awkward you then make it a whole lot worse
A	mm
B	cos you don't show any consideration
A	mm
B	er nine sharing inappropriate anecdotes I told you in private with random people this is like the the Farc one with
A	it was
B	erm and okay so those are the socialising ones that I've lumped together
A	yeah
B	but you know talking about sharing inappropriate sexual things now you know going on from inappropriate anecdotes and talking about your previous sexual encounters discussing our sex life with your friends that's very offensive erm okay
A	don't you discuss our sex life with a close friend sometimes?
B	er it's inappropriate especially if you expect me to meet them afterwards
A	no not meet them I mean I mean you know for example you know now
B	no the breakup
A	what was this
B	that's okay
A	oh that's the breakup yeah
B	that's not sexual
A	yeah that's true what was the sex one?
B	no you telling
A	yeah that was yeah
B	and then saying oh I'd like you to meet him
A	well
B	why would I want to meet him now? it's embarrassing
A	he told me stuff about his girlfriend
B	okay but as we've established
A	that doesn't two wrongs don't make a
B	he's a wanker
A	he is a wanker yeah
B	so
A	yeah he is
B	yeah anyway okay so the next one I've starred as very important
A	mm
B	dishonesty and yet claiming to be honest as you didn't tell an outright lie for example applying to your jobs abroad and not telling me and the breakup so you say
A	this is
B	I would never lie to you you told me that
A	well
B	so many times in the relationship I'd never lie to you I could never lie to you but you're lying all the time to me you're
B	you're lying by omission
A	I can't argue with that
B	that's really serious that was one that put all of those
A	I didn't see
B	other things
A	I didn't see them as lies
B	they're kind of like
A	at the time but they are
B	but they are they're very serious
A	yeah they are
B	they're very serious lies
A	they are
B	okay er twelve allowing your family and friends to disrespect me and steal stuff from our home and then assuming that money can just fix it
A	well what do you
A	I know yeah but
B	your uncle was very rude to me as well
A	yeah but I couldn't I couldn't if I'd if I'd
B	and your family friends were very rude to me as well
A	do you know what would have happened if I'd? it's
B	with
A	but with
B	no I'm serious
A	I would have exploded with
A	shouting
B	is mentally ill so I would have left that one
A	she is
B	myself
A	yeah
B	but your uncle was very disrespectful to me
A	what did he do?
B	going on about asking me inappropriate questions about
A	yeah he well he's he's he's
B	sexual relationship and stuff
A	yeah but this is the same
B	that's very inappropriate
A	yeah it is inappropriate
B	he knows that he's an Arab he
A	yeah
B	he knows that's very inappropriate to ask
A	it
B	a woman
A	it is inappropriate and he's the same guy who
B	yeah
A	two thousand six hundred rial
B	yeah
A	sorry two thousand six hundred dollars
B	but also you assume when things like that happened and the family is stealing from us same uncle that's weird you let them get away with it
A	but that was small that was small things it was toilet paper
B	it wasn't all yours
A	well
B	no the toilet paper who cares?
A	I couldn't I mean
B	he emptied the entire tea cupboard
A	yeah that's alright it's not a big deal
B	it is
A	I'm not bothered about that
B	it wasn't even all yours
A	I know
B	some of that was mine
A	fine
B	I brought it here
A	I'll compensate you for it
B	but this is what I'm saying assuming money fixes it it doesn't
A	okay it's the principle of the stealing
B	I don't care it wasn't you who took it
A	yeah that's true
B	if you had took then you would have paid for it
A	yeah
B	it's the principle and therefore that you don't stand for it you don't stand up for yourself and you don't stand up for me and this was my home too
A	yeah you're right
B	and he's just wiped out a cupboard we knew he had and we knew him before he left the house
A	I didn't know I
B	you did before he left the house
A	it's
B	I went to make to make you a cup of tea
A	it's when we discovered it in the yeah then I found out
B	and then
A	but before
B	you said where is it? and you said I've taken it all and you said oh that's alright then it wasn't alright
A	mm you're right
B	he'd stolen the whole cupboard
A	yeah you're right
B	he would he could have just asked and you would have always said yes
A	mm
B	of course you would have or can you just take those?
A	yes
B	because that's actually
A	it it's probably indicative of his underlying dishonesty
B	yeah and your family friend was very disrespectful as well
A	which one?
B	that old woman
A	oh there that that woman
B	and got away with it
A	when we went to their house?
B	yeah
A	she was a fucking bitch
B	that was awful yeah but you let her get away with it anyway
A	the one that said grab him by the tie?
B	no the one who said
A	that one
B	what's your relationship? the second we walked in
A	yeah
B	that was awful so embarrassing and awful
A	it was embarrassing and awful
B	but you let her get away with it
A	I should have left
B	we should have all left we should have just said I'm we're not staying with this it's none of your business
A	yeah
B	okay er
A	it was uncomfortable for me
B	it was awful the whole thing was
A	it was just unexpected
B	awful after that
A	but I put it down to her being mentally ill
B	but you you said she was rude to you before asking about your salary
A	yeah that was
B	but you let her get away with it
A	that was rude yeah that was rude
B	you should have just said to what's-her-name afterwards
A	I
B	I'm like
A	it's not her mum
B	I'm not gonna come round
A	it's her mother-in-law she can't stand her
B	no but you should have told her why you're not coming round in future say look I love you you're a great person you've cooked so much for me I think you're great but I'm sorry but your mother-in-law is so rude not you know
A	yeah
B	I'm not blaming you in any way I just want you to know why I'm not coming round again
A	mm that's true but I didn't I guess
B	and if you if you'd like to socialise anywhere else you'd like to come to my house if I can get you dinner any time I'm going to invite you out in fact
A	true
B	because I definitely you know I owe you dinner
A	need a break from that place
B	and I owe you dinner you've done so much for me
A	but
B	I'd love you to come out have a coffee
A	true
B	any time call me
A	that's true
B	when you're free er half an hour
A	yeah but
B	that's fine
A	but the way I did it
B	near your house
A	the way I the way I saw it was I'm not letting that woman get to me she's a fucking
B	but she got to me she disrespected me
A	mm she did
B	and embarrassed me
A	yeah
B	as a guest in their house
A	yeah she did
B	how awful
A	that is awful
B	and you didn't protect me you didn't do anything
A	I didn't realise that you felt that bad
B	of course I did
A	it was rude we talked about it afterwards
B	we did and that guy came and said sorry for her which was nice of him
A	which guy?
B	one of the sons
A	yeah
B	I think it was a son I don't know but a son in law but anyway
A	yeah yeah
B	you you should have stood up for me
A	yeah
B	erm yeah this is a weird couple that I've put about belittling me these I've lumped together when I lived in
A	when you were a manager at
B	it was really patronising
A	sorry
B	it was like you wanted to put me down
A	no that's not I wasn't
B	and belittle me
A	no hang on no that
B	why would you change my job title?
A	no it as more that the sector and the profession that that is what your
B	but why would you say I was a completely different job?
A	okay well what I
B	I didn't teach then
A	I know that I know that but no no this this is that is okay going to have to strike it off the list because
B	why? it's weird
A	no that was not a conscious effort on my part to
B	why did you do it then?
A	because what was I gonna say? a
B	what's wrong with that?
A	I know mm
B	sorry what is wrong with that? why would you change my job title completely?
A	you you think it's some sort of erm you know
B	you want to put me down
A	chauvinistic
B	yeah it's really weird
A	that's not
B	cos
A	that's
B	why would you change someone's? it's not like you changed it a little bit like you know I'm a team leader of you know so I only teach sixteen hours as opposed to twenty it's not like that
A	yeah
B	I mean this was actually a job where I never taught there was no teaching involved
A	no
B	that was really weird it was like you wanted to put me down
A	well I'm sorry that's not I wasn't I
B	and you did it not just once but lots of times
A	yeah but that no but that wasn't a
B	it may not have been conscious but you did it
A	I know
B	a lot of times and I found it really really weird
A	well
B	like why do you want to change my job title?
A	I never had that that
B	but you did
A	intention okay?
B	and it's really odd
A	it was just easier than saying manager
B	really odd why?
A	a manager of what? yeah
B	why is that easier? teacher of what?
A	true
B	odd very odd it's like okay so
A	maybe it's cos I knew you as a teacher when I first met you than I knew were anyway I wouldn't er honestly that one
B	so yeah the next one I've put together belittling me and putting me down for example over the job that's how I felt about that that you wanted to put me down
A	okay
B	okay so the next one erm is about generosity where I've said you were very generous financially too generous but that's a a compliment not a an insult not a bad thing but you never you're not generous with your time or help around
A	yes
B	around the house
A	that's true
B	for example you never did a weekly shop you very rarely did
A	never? no that's not mm
B	we did it once at the beginning in the first week together together and after that you never did it you very rarely cooked and only then when I called you on it and said it wasn't fair er you never replaced like the booze you take for friends then you say well I don't drink it
A	no but I did no not not never
B	but you made a point of taking it
A	no never is extreme I did go buy a vodka I remember
B	yeah because I insisted that time and I went on and on and on about it
A	oh yeah
B	didn't I?
A	maybe I needed some guidance
B	and you said if it's about the money do you want the money? I said it's not about the money
A	it's about the principle of replacing it
B	it's it's never about the money you were very generous financially I I would never argue with you about money
A	it's about the active replacing
B	it's the that time and help can't be bought with money
A	it's true
B	you've taken something and used it all I don't mind though the expectation is
A	you replace
B	you replace it
A	this is true
B	and also that you took something of mine
A	this is true
B	so yeah you think that money can substitute for that it doesn't
A	and it can't
B	it can't and it's not
A	you're right
B	the same thing okay and next we're back to socialising er again I thought of new ones you force conversations into other languages for example that time we met
A	yeah
B	by chance er without even
A	yeah
B	bothering to check if it's okay with me and he felt really awkward and he was checking with me and you just carried on regardless but you didn't think about me
A	yeah
B	you didn't ask and it's not the only time
A	and it made you uncomfortable
B	it made me uncomfortable
A	I'm sorry
B	excluding me from conversations socially by for example talking about your work or sexual exploits prostitution etcetera I'm not gonna be able to join in with these things so you're gonna make me feel really awkward
A	like what where?
B	talking about your work like with
A	yeah but a bit of that is
B	twenty minutes
A	but a bit of that we can't help
B	but no you need to be
A	we hadn't seen each other for a long time
B	considerate who is in the room
A	I know
B	you can't just do that
A	yeah
B	you have to say to her oh I'm sorry this is really boring for
A	I think we did that
B	you didn't you talked about work
A	the whole time?
B	no I'm just saying for the twenty minutes I felt really awkward cos I had nothing to say
A	okay
B	and you made me feel really bad
A	sorry
B	and I had nowhere to go
A	I'm sorry
B	what could I have done? walked out? it would have looked so rude
A	I'm sorry
B	or with guys talking about prostitution
A	yeah that was
B	for god's sake
A	that was bad that was only one occasion
B	that was horrible
A	it was only once
B	that was only once with him it's happened with other times with other people
A	like who? like when?
B	I don't remember
B	look you do this okay?
A	yeah alright that's only two occasions
B	talking about work no there's two that you remember
A	no the work the
B	no it's not there's more I just don't remember them all okay?
A	well I don't remember them either
B	I'm just telling you I remember these specific occasions
A	okay
B	okay the next one we're off erm back to the beginning one complaining when I'm not at home when you get home and then expecting me to change my plans even though you don't change your plans
A	yeah
B	like that's not fair like I'll be going on a walk and you'll say oh do you have to do that? oh
A	yeah one sided you're right
B	yeah and er isn't it good for me to go and see these people?
A	it is good
B	inappropriate sexual contact in public well I've asked you not to do that like the kissing and the touching too much like it's different in the house but
A	well I didn't realise
B	not in the street
A	it bothered you
A	yeah I know
B	it wouldn't bother me if we were in any other country
A	mm
B	er so the next one is all about sex imbalance in sexual favours it's eighty percent about you so of course you're very happy with that
A	no that's not true
B	isn't it?
A	well it's not eighty percent
B	what percentage would you say?
A	no
B	is it fifty fifty?
A	it's definitely the majority for you it's more sixty forty
B	the majority for me?
A	the
B	mm
A	but sixty forty I'd say
B	I reckon it's more at least seventy
A	no I would
B	yeah
A	no let's bring it down to sixty-five
B	no it's way imbalanced anyway and it's imbalance and you know that so
A	I thought we both felt
B	you're happy
A	fulfilled
B	and I'm sometimes happy that's not really great is it?
A	I thought you were really
B	oh I do but there's give and take
A	yeah
B	it's not just take
A	yeah
B	there was too much take er not experimenting enough with sex not being interested in trying
A	that's true
B	when I've tried stuff so you're fine about it so therefore I must be not necessarily I might be bored
A	yeah
B	all about you again you're happy so you're fine
A	that's true
B	okay I'm I'm off that one erm refusing to listen this is er a general guy thing I think
A	yeah
B	most men would have this for example the windscreen wiper fiasco
A	no I mean
B	erm behaving very patronisingly towards me at times like not listening just
A	yeah
B	yeah it's patronising
A	it is
B	this is patronising like that you just decided to break up and not give me a chance to say anything just disappearing
A	well it does happen
B	er being inflexible we talked about this one ourselves before
A	yeah
B	being inflexible with your gym football schedule but expecting me to change mine for yours so general inflexibility with that and we we mentioned that
A	like when?
B	like your grandfather
A	yeah
B	you didn't bother to change your schedule at all that's why I've put it next to the gym and football one
A	yeah to spend time with him
B	to spend time with him
A	you're right
B	and that wasn't fair on him or me
A	no
B	and what's he gonna do? go off on his own and explore
A	no you're right
B	and he was here for a long time and you didn't treat him well
A	no he wanted to spend time
B	he came cos he wanted to spend time with you
A	you're right
B	and then you didn't
A	my mum and sister
B	your mum your sister
A	no my mum didn't treat me like shit or use me
B	I dunno I think she's taking advantage
A	no she
B	of your generosity
A	she
B	I don't mean financially
A	no she didn't
B	your sister treated you like shit your mum
A	no
B	lets her get away with it
A	mm yeah but she didn't she
B	your friends sometimes treat you like shit like
A	no
B	and you let them get away with it
A	mm
B	you shouldn't you shouldn't let people treat you like that your uncle treats you like shit both uncles actually
A	no not
B	everyone's very rude to you
A	well yeah the one here
B	the one in
A	the one here I can't stand yeah
B	the one
A	it is rude
B	and the one in sorry but the one in
A	in
B	is taking advantage of you
A	he's deceitful
B	financially he's deceitful he's not
A	yeah
B	a particularly nice person
A	no
B	that doesn't mean you shouldn't you you should cut these
A	mm
B	you just need to tell them
A	mm
A	he he would keep lying all the way
B	going to wouldn't matter he needs to be told
A	and he wouldn't
B	and you'd feel better for it yourself
A	he wouldn't accept he wouldn't
B	doesn't matter if he accepts it you know
A	mm
B	he knows deep down it's right inviting your relative to stay longer than agreed er and either not ask and or not asking at all like your grandfather's second visit
A	yeah
B	we agreed about the first one you never ever asked me about the second you just told me
A	no I did tell you
B	that's what you had agreed
A	yeah we didn't discuss it
B	in the car with your uncle you never asked
A	we didn't
B	that was really rude
A	mm
B	I live here and you're not even looking after him when you're
A	mm that's true
B	that wasn't fair
A	the second the
B	it was pointless cos you weren't prepared to
A	spend time with him
B	spend time with him so then
A	and I don't want him
B	he felt bad
A	and then when we talk to each other on the phone
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B wants to see him	Contradiction
B	yeah but you've
A	I've gotta get on with
B	again it's about
A	I've gotta get on with my life

B	to be honest
A	so I can't do it again

B	you've seen him a lot or at least do it in six months
A	I don't wanna have him over
[ANNOTATION]	speaker A has seen him this year	Entailment
B	mm I don't think you can do that entirely he is your grandfather he's not gonna be around forever
A	I know he's not but
B	he's not gonna be able to fly forever
A	exactly
B	so six every six months you can have him for two weeks
A	yeah but that's not how it works
B	you don't have him for longer
A	cos he gets a visa for three months
B	mm
A	and then he spends time with my uncle and then I have to see my
B	you don't need to you can drop him off downstairs there's a lift
[ANNOTATION]	the grandfather is dying	Neutral
A	I'll get him no I'll get him to erm get him over er in a in a taxi I'll pay the taxi fare
B	yeah or just drop him off literally outside the house you don't have to go in
[ANNOTATION]	the grandfather wants to come here	Neutral
A	yeah exactly
B	there's a lift
A	yeah yeah there is a lift
B	you can go to the you can actually go in the lift with him
A	yes
B	and put the bag right outside the door and then say sorry I've got to run

[ANNOTATION]	the place has an elevator	Entailment
A	yeah
B	so he's not shocked
A	yeah
B	okay anyway this erm about relatives that's finished
A	mm
B	disrespecting my friends like
A	er
B	that wasn't very nice
[ANNOTATION]	the grandfather wants to stay	Neutral
A	I know we just didn't get on
B	but you still don't have to call her a slut
A	I didn't call her a slut
B	you did
A	okay sorry
B	and some other nasty words which
A	sorry
B	were unpleasant so no wonder she doesn't like you she knows not that I told her of course but she's a woman
A	breaking up breaking up I can't accept because that
B	it was unilateral
A	it happens
B	this is the problem
A	I know but it happens
B	no but we don't make unilateral decisions
A	when you
B	you discuss it
A	when you left
B	that we talked it through and I didn't run away and I gave him plenty of opportunity to respond over the next two weeks I didn't go anywhere er then I said I have to go I'm gonna be looking for somewhere to move he had lots of time to talk it through with me
A	mm
B	and he might not be able to the second I tell him he was so
A	yeah that's true
B	so you know he needs a bit of time you can't just say oh oh
A	yeah yeah
B	well what do you think?
A	next
B	what do you think? next
A	yeah that's true
B	running away this is related running away instead of facing up to things
A	no I won't
B	this is the first time in this whole breakup that you've came here of your own volition and sat down and talked about it so that's good you've done this
A	yeah
B	agreeing to something then changing your mind and blaming me twenty-four hours later
A	sorry
B	take responsibility for yourself
A	yeah for sure
B	don't blame me it wasn't true then yeah this is getting a bit nastier now general weakness of mind this is like the thirty changing your mind and blaming me er paranoia
A	yeah I am a bit
B	like I'm seeing other people that I have relationship with people that I haven't told you about an overreaction like if you don't know where I am every second
B	like thinking the worst like not that it's an accident's happened but thinking
A	possessive
B	oh you know she's off with someone
A	yeah
B	so that's
A	I do
B	needing your boss to fulfil your father role
A	yeah
B	and we've discussed that before
A	that's cos I've had a shit
B	but it's not helping you're an adult
A	of course
B	you're an adult you don't need a father like that any more
B	avoiding
A	yeah
B	you didn't you assumed
A	I mean I felt he was pissed off and he left early
B	if you paid for everything yeah that it was okay it's not okay
A	no
B	he didn't come because he's trying to get freebies from you
A	no
B	any reasonable person wouldn't do that
A	yeah
B	and he's a nice person and
A	yeah
B	you made him feel bad
A	yeah that's true
B	that's just one example
A	yeah that's true
B	avoiding difficult conversations er or working at things dishonesty as a result for example with me
A	yeah
B	moaning all the time about
A	mm
B	you'll never have enough money this is life
A	it's true
B	you can't have enough money so leave you have enough you've bought your place in
A	but I've only been at this company ten months nine months and I can't er it just doesn't look good on my CV I've got a plan you know I I'm planning to go
B	okay but stop moaning and make the most of it
A	true make the most of it and stop
B	you've got
A	moaning
B	there's good things about being here
A	there are
B	and you can go away a lot more if you want
A	yeah
B	with you know weekends you can usually get away a lot further
A	you're right
A	yeah
B	like you tried to tell me the other day that Isis were just making it all up this slavery thing they weren't they got it straight out of the Koran
A	okay
B	but
A	no I do
B	the thing is other scholars take it as a with you know a religious context that it was written in
A	mm
B	rather than that you know prophet is saying well you should all have slaves now
A	mm
B	and therefore you can do what you like with them
A	mm
B	that well yeah you need to read up on that it's it's your culture anyway that's a minor one
A	not my culture
B	you are Arab
A	yeah
B	so it's part of your culture
A	but I'm not a Muslim I'm not Muslim no it's not
B	it's still part of it
A	you can be Arab and Christian
B	but you're not
A	yeah I know but I'm but I'm an atheist
B	you're an atheist but you defend the faith do you see what I mean?
A	yeah I have a different
B	we had a conversation the other day where you started defending it
A	yeah
B	er and you know were all uppity about it
A	well because
B	and then
A	because I just look at my family
B	you don't know anything about it
A	I look at my family
B	yeah this is what I mean
A	that are Muslim
B	it's part of your culture because it's part of your family background
A	yeah
B	I'm not saying it's your religion
A	no I know
B	it's part of your family's culture
A	yeah
B	and therefore yours so you should learn a bit more that's a minor point
A	yeah
B	telling everyone else this is a major one I've put three stars telling everyone else about the breakup months before me and failing to see how hurtful that is
A	yeah
B	that was very hurtful
A	yeah I know
B	thirty-eight failing this is also three stars failing to see that I have been through and am going through an extremely trying life event since I moved here and not allowing for that just because I'm not crying my eyes out doesn't mean I'm okay
A	yeah
B	I've been through some of the biggest things that can happen to someone since I moved here
A	yeah
B	and you think cos I'm not cry er and sitting around bawling my eyes out and talking about it all the time
A	that it's not
B	people cope about with these things in different ways
A	yeah
B	and one of the ways that I've coped is by shutting myself away more than I would normally
A	you mean about
A	yeah
B	stress
A	yeah
B	there are other things that measure success not that those things are bad but they're just two of a big range
A	more profound things
B	yeah so
A	mm
B	often mentally ill abusive some of them or weak the two tend to go together and you want me to spend time with them
A	with who okay?
B	anyone
A	mm
B	look at them I mean look at that
A	oh I'm sorry
B	you couldn't even put that on TV
A	it was
B	I mean you wouldn't be able to sell a soap opera with that kind of behaviour
A	it was awful
B	yeah you know it was awful and your mum doesn't do anything instead
A	no she did she told her before they travelled here she told her don't you dare talk to
B	but she didn't do anything
A	yeah
B	while she was here
A	yeah
B	so you know I just walk into that off a flight and
A	yeah I know that's er
B	it was awful
A	well it was awful I felt like shit after that
B	yeah it was terrible and I mean I don't want to spend time with people like that
A	no
B	awful
A	yeah
B	er your disapproval over alcohol and eating brunches means that social life has been a lot more boring than I'd want and you've been more controlling
A	mm
B	it's been about you doing it your way and I
A	it's true
B	that would have been a lot happier the next ones I've put big stars for cos we're on the last page you're a quitter not a fighter you are more afraid of having a difficult conversation than losing someone you claim to love
A	you're right
B	you inform once you're asked outright
A	no I was gonna inform you anyway but
B	at some point
A	no yeah I was gonna inform you and I had a date in mind I had a week before you were gonna go but I realise now
B	it's not good enough
A	that that was yeah that was that was actually a mistake and erm
B	you're emotionally illiterate you are unable to see things from others' perspectives
A	it's true
B	example you think I'm jealous of friends like
A	mm
B	ditto your other friends who don't always have your best interests at heart not all of them but some of them
A	mm
B	I just know she doesn't have your best interests at heart like what she said about you at the opera house that time that made me realise
A	you didn't tell me then
B	I told you saw her
A	I just remember that you came back after that event and said yeah I don't not sure I like her or something like that
B	yeah this is why
A	I didn't
B	I said she said something about you and you said what? and I just kind of said a little bit of what she said
A	you didn't say
B	but I didn't tell you about the the USP thing and you know
A	what's the USP?
B	just really undermining you unique selling point
A	yeah
B	that she said basically the only reason you've got a job at all is cos you speak Arabic
A	even though
B	not because you're actually
A	even though ninety
B	any good at your job
A	even though ninety-eight percent of my job doesn't involve any Arabic
B	of course she's just jealous
A	mm
B	and therefore you wouldn't be able to get one at home because you don't have a a selling point any more whereas she has
A	what a what a cow
B	yeah really er and then I the this one not a star I mentioned it before though I hate it when you text in bed for example right after sex or even during
A	mm okay
B	like answering the phone you make me feel really cheap then you complain when I ask what who or why you're texting that's why it's rude
A	mm
B	er and the last one three stars you strung me along for six months and still are today and I can't decide is this a control thing or do you are just completely indecisive? either way it's not good enough
A	mm
B	there
A	mm
B	that was my work day
A	most of it is
B	what wasn't true?
A	well I kind of the prostitutes talking about prostitutes and that it was definitely wrong and shouldn't have been done but it wasn't a regular feature of the relationship it was only twice
B	prostitutes maybe it was only twice
A	no well
B	but then there was that weird time at
B	that was weird and I had to like stop you
A	that was weird yeah that was weird
B	that was weird like
A	that was weird
B	it just makes me on edge
A	yeah I know
B	cos I feel like I can't relax
A	I know I'm sorry
B	cos you're gonna say something really inappropriate
A	I'm sorry
B	and then with my parents you said weird things on the phone
A	yeah that thing about the the
B	that was really weird
A	about the way the the
B	it's not just once
B	and then the Jewish thing like
A	yeah oh yeah
B	and then to my mum when she stayed you said about having sex with a you know some people are so Jewish they have sex with a sheet and just a hole
B	there's lots there have been lots of
A	yeah I know
B	what else wasn't true?
A	mm
B	it's kind of by default
A	no she didn't
B	she didn't do anything
A	yeah but she didn't she didn't
B	she didn't care
A	no she did that's why she brought her here she wanted us three
B	she didn't care about me I was saying
A	no my mum
B	she cared about
A	no she did
B	you making up with
A	no she did care because
B	didn't seem like it
A	you know she didn't she had words with her what in
B	but shouldn't have brought her here
A	yeah
B	it was wrong
A	well it was
B	and I certainly shouldn't have have been
A	it was too soon
B	subjected to that
A	no you should not you should not
B	you should have fixed the flights that I didn't even have to see them
A	and by the way I may not have done something at the time but erm
B	you did afterwards you
A	yeah
B	you sent her an email
A	yeah
B	yes you did afterwards but it's not just that saying er the family friends
A	and I not only didn't
B	you didn't stand up for me
A	yeah yeah that that I that oh yeah
B	it's so bad you don't get
A	it is bad it's
B	it's it's really rude
A	it is rude but er but I put it down to her being er just bonkers and batty
B	no it's not she knows
A	she's
B	why do you think she asked you about the salary? she did it deliberately she's not bonkers and batty that's just an excuse
A	yeah she is rude
B	she's just deliberately offensive
A	she is offensive she is
B	we should have just left
A	we should have left
B	you should have stood up for me shouldn't make me sit there for hours
A	we should have left but grandad was there wasn't he?
B	too bad you should have just said that's really rude of you
A	yeah
B	and you know that's rude that's offensive that
A	I need I
B	yeah
A	cos I I think there have been a few situations
B	just tell people that's really offensive
A	there have been a few situations where I've needed to up and leave
B	yeah and I'm not gonna stand for this
A	mm well today today
B	how dare you invite people
A	today
B	to your house and then insult them the second they arrive?
A	like today
B	it's terrible
A	this guy at work this American guy who's switched off and doesn't give a shit and doesn't do anything cos he wants to leave
B	mm
A	and he he just is physically there but mentally absent and lazy like when he I give him something to help with he just comes and say yeah so how do you do this? and he did that today oh how do I? I said look it's just in that document go and look at it and he could tell that I was not my usual self
B	mm
A	cos normally I'm like oh you know I'm I kind of explain and I just got frustrated because all the work is piling down on my boss and I
B	mm
A	and there are others are just
B	and me
A	twiddling their thumbs my boss and me
B	well that's that then
A	at least you've got a clear idea how things weren't rosy
B	yeah
A	it's helped
B	but I'm not a quitter
A	I might I mean you know I might feel differently when you come back here but then it might be too late
B	it will be
A	yeah well anyway erm but
B	you don't have to stay in the apartment by the way you can just stay here
A	mm no
B	why?
A	cos I would rather do that
B	why?
A	because because I like I said I don't want us I don't want things to descend
B	it's not going to we've done it it's over
A	but yeah I know we have but at the same time
B	cos there's no reason
A	I
B	I don't need it I'm fine about it
A	I'm quite and I'm quite enjoying it
B	you can just be a housemate
A	no it's
B	really
A	no it's okay
B	we'll have a housemate we don't spend time with each other
A	I don't want to
B	it's no I'm fine about it honestly
A	I know you are I don't
B	I'm okay
A	I don't I'm I'm not
B	why?
A	cos I just don't want to
B	but it's your house
A	I know it's my house I I er I want to I wanna I wanna just make sure you have somewhere to stay and you're okay until you go back to the UK
B	no I am fine
A	I know you are
B	I'm fine living here
A	I know you are er but I'm not
B	but you're well you won't be fine wherever you are so you might as well save some money
B	I'm just saying
A	no erm I'll be fine I'll be fine I'm I'm gonna put
B	how much is it there?
A	two hundred and fifty-eight dirham a night
B	yeah that's quite a lot
A	no that's actually quite it's extremely reasonable it's the
B	yeah my my colleague was saying that
A	it's twenty
B	he's actually saying
A	yeah
B	he when his lease is up on the flat
A	that's what I'm gonna do
B	he's gonna go and live in a hotel apartment
A	that's what I'm gonna do
B	because you can get them for as little as five thousand a month and he says my rent's way more than that
A	yeah that's what I'm gonna do
B	and it includes all the bills and internet
A	yeah
B	and sometimes a five star hotel
A	it's five star quality almost er the room
B	yeah
A	there's wi-fi
B	yeah
A	there's TV satellite TV I worked out that in rent alone
B	mm
A	cos here I pay one one five
B	yeah it's probably cheaper for them
A	here I pay ninety-four it's twenty plus thousand dirham cheaper that's
B	it's madness isn't it?
A	two thousand rial a year but that doesn't include the savings that I'd make on bills I pay
B	but are you including the tax? is there a ten plus six tax there?
A	mm none there's no tax
B	are you sure?
A	yeah yeah
B	cos there's normally a ten percent and a six percent on hotels here
A	mm yeah well
B	you'd better check that
A	let me work it out well because two five eight times seven days it came to one thousand eight hundred and something is what I paid but let me just see what the tax is
B	but yeah that's what he was saying he's done the maths and it was way cheaper to live in a
A	hotel apartment
B	hotel apartment he could go and
A	wow
B	yeah you know the ones where your dad stayed?
A	maybe I need to look into that the ones on the side yeah
B	yeah it
A	maybe I need to look into that
B	weren't great they were very
A	yeah
B	basic
A	my dad said that or the guy?
B	no he said I mean we saw them remember?
A	yeah
B	cos it's not really a kitchen you have there but the facilities are amazing
A	yeah two five eight
B	and he said
A	times
B	there isn't really wi-fi in the rooms there
A	no
B	but there's wi-fi in all the public areas
A	no tax that's the two five eight includes the tax and everything
B	yeah that's good
A	it is good so it's ninety-four thousand it's over twenty thousand dirham cheaper a year
B	yeah madness
A	and and it's then when you start counting things like electricity and water bills
B	exactly
A	and internet and TV bill which is four hundred and
B	yeah it's not cheap
A	fifty dirham a month or something insane
B	yeah
A	it's it's actually more like thirty thousand
B	yeah
A	and things like cleaner costs
B	and then you wouldn't need to pay for the gym
A	cleaner costs they clean every day
B	yeah you wouldn't need to pay for the gym you've got like a five star gym usually
A	yeah the only downside is the hob is only two
B	yeah
A	I've cooked twice
B	yeah
A	the hob but you can't really there's only a
B	you can't really properly
A	you there's no oven
B	yeah
A	yeah you can't cook properly I've cooked the first weekend I've just been
B	mm
A	on a weekend because I'm not I
B	no
A	and there's loads of restaurant options nearby
B	yeah yeah that's the good thing there
A	there's a Lebanese
B	there's loads of cheap restaurants
A	yeah
A	yeah and so the the
B	yeah but you could still do salad and stuff like you could have your evening meal there
A	yeah
B	if you wanted right? you could just you know make a salad you've got a fridge
A	yeah you could
B	and everything haven't you?
A	yeah I've got a fridge yeah
B	so you could do actually quite a lot of stuff
A	yeah I've cooked
B	just with that
A	the first weekend I cooked erm a pasta sauce
B	mm
A	courgettes
B	uhu
A	onion garlic tomato and with prawns just
B	mm
A	just from the
B	mm right
A	with gluten-free pasta came out okay
B	yeah that's good
A	not as great as the last one was this weekend just gone was erm basil pesto with garlic crushed garlic
B	oh okay
A	er or chopped garlic cos I
B	oh yeah when I saw you yeah
A	which was delicious
B	it was really nice
A	you can
B	yeah you can do a lot of stuff
A	it's fine
B	on the hob
A	yeah it's amazing
B	I mean a lot of people in the world that's all they have
A	yeah
B	and they're fine er
A	they are fine
B	is there a toaster and things?
A	no toaster
B	oh why don't you take that spare one?
A	but there's coffee no it's okay I don't need toast I don't really cos I'm gluten-free
B	you don't really eat it ah that's true
A	yeah I mean I'll I used to
B	kettle? have you got a kettle?
A	a kettle yeah kettle
B	yeah
A	coffee tea
B	oh you could drink quite a lot
A	I haven't really used it yet
B	yeah
A	in two weeks cos I'm not a big drinker of coffee and tea
B	that's true
A	as you know
B	yeah you could take your tea with you your thyme tea
A	yeah that's okay I don't really need it but what and they've got Animal Planet on TV
B	oh nice
A	this channel that I really like
B	yeah no it's not a bad option
A	but the
B	yeah he was saying this guy was quite financially savvy and he was just saying it's
A	I'm gonna do it
B	there's absolutely no point me paying for the rent again next year
A	yeah well I what I
B	it's not any cheaper and you could always
A	you know
B	look around I mean I'm sure there's loads of good ones and a lot of them don't forget they do er a government rate
A	yes
B	even if they don't have a
A	they all have government rates
B	so yeah my
A	yeah
B	you pay for it but it's not very much like a thousand a year
A	I'm gonna flog
B	but then you get twenty percent off the bill
A	I'm gonna
B	it's huge
A	I've decided that when I cos er my lease is up in December
B	yeah it's not a bad option at all
A	that when I move back
B	and also that you can move around quite easily
A	yeah
B	in the city you just say oh after a month oh I'm gonna try out the
A	and then when you leave the country
B	yeah there's nothing to cancel
A	so so
B	so easy yeah
A	and and the only thing is the furniture so I my lease is up in December
B	ah yeah the furniture
A	and I'm gonna I'm gonna start
B	you can sell stuff
A	flogging it yeah
B	yeah
A	start flogging it and erm
B	yeah
A	and then just move cos I'll I know I'll I'll I know I'll be on the home straight then anyway cos I'll be moving back
B	it's true no I was thinking that if my housing allowance is okay
A	mm
B	and will cover either a one bed but there isn't anything in it cos a one bed here is expensive
A	yeah
B	it's like seventy thousand
A	did you look at?
B	for the cheapest
A	I saw at the back of erm The Week there's like adverts for places
B	yeah and the other thing is there's like
A	rooms
B	agency fees
A	five percent
B	so you yeah it's huge
A	it is a lot
B	a lot
A	three percent? I think it's three percent
B	oh I know so then you've got to add that in as well
A	yeah but hang on when I looked The Week the back of The Week
B	mm
A	once I saw that they advertised a room
B	mm but I don't know
A	and you can you just
B	if it's like Indians and that kind of stuff you know
A	but these are worth investigating
B	I'm not sure I want to live in
A	it's too far away
B	it's so horrible even though I've got that awful commute in the morning
A	yeah
B	at least you can have a bit of a life
A	it what you could do is live near
B	yeah exactly that would be ideal
A	like a little a little kind of tiny place
B	yeah
A	that's not far from there
B	it's true
A	where you don't have a commute effectively
B	yeah
A	you just walk there and get in on
B	that's right
A	get on the bus
B	that would be nice
A	but the trouble is the noise like where I am I'm on the eleventh floor but it's noisy
B	mm
A	I cos I'm I'm overlooking
B	oh
A	a rural road
B	yeah
A	and up the whole
B	but can't you ask for like a the other side?
A	I I can but their suites are like the lux
B	oh
A	I'll I'll come to an arrangement with them
B	yeah
A	erm when I when I negotiate my bit my long term deal
B	well look you can just stay here we're fine
A	no I don't
B	I really do think we are
A	no I I
B	we don't have to you know
A	I I I'm not comfortable with it
B	why?
A	because I just do not want to incur the risk of what we've managed to to end so I've never had I I mean you know
B	it's
A	a
B	you know again
A	in such a civil way
B	you're more you're scared of what could happen
A	yes I am
B	all the time
A	I am I don't want you
A	I know I can't I know I can't but I don't want you to I don't want us to you know
B	do you think we're gonna be great friends after this anyway? does it make any difference?
A	I I'd like to retain the possibility is how I
