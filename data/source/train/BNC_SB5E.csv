A	I don't even know if I'm allowed to do it on this like cos I didn't wanna tell them that this
B	mm
B	I mean do you know how to write your like erm?
A	no
B	have you got like
A	I have no idea
B	the body of the essay?
A	no not at all
B	okay okay
A	I just don't know
B	don't worry we can fix this
A	mm
B	what you can do is to actually do this essay you could
A	the Daily Mail?
B	not the Daily Mail
A	yeah
B	but read like
A	no like from I know what you mean
B	read
A	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	very basic rather than oh shit hitting everything
A	sorry
B	oh that
A	on that shitty bed
B	automatically makes it
A	I hate those beds
B	your fault
A	is your bed like this? with the wooden thing?
B	yeah yeah it's annoying
A	yeah they're annoying those aren't they? I hate them
B	cos you can't like
A	you just feel like they're cots or something
B	oh my god they do
A	yeah erm I don't I don't know it's like the thing is it's just the writing bit like I just don't have the right it sounds stupid but I literally like when people write essays I don't know how to do that anymore
B	mm
A	you know? er
B	I know yeah I mean cos you
A	I just don't
B	kind of you kind of get out of the habit of writing essays don't you?
A	yeah
B	like you? like you just don't
A	the last essay I wrote was the one
A	and so I don't know why it's
B	that's probably why you're struggling so much because I think you're
A	well I dunno
B	I think maybe you're
A	mm
A	yeah
B	but you don't
A	but I'm not gonna be able to
B	yeah
B	maybe you've got like an idea in your head of what it should be like but that's completely like almost unobtainable
A	mm I dunno
B	like
A	I don't feel like it's unobtainable
B	it's
A	that's how I would want mine to sound in that kind of
B	that essay wasn't very good though
A	yeah but it no
B	mm
A	understandable and
B	cos that that wasn't even a
A	yeah no no no
B	cos I couldn't even express myself
A	yeah
B	properly
A	not the structure but it's like
B	but yeah
A	more the words and the
B	oh yeah
A	the language
B	the words
A	and stuff just I I just don't know how to make mine sound like that cos I'm so shit these days that it like I can't do it
B	I mean mine didn't sound like that straight away like you have to read through it a few times
A	yeah
B	and try and like make words sound a bit better and you
A	yeah
B	vary your language a bit and make it a bit like juicy but and like to be honest
A	mm
B	cos I think the more you worry about it the more it builds up and the more unable you are to do it
A	yeah
B	so maybe if you get a piece of paper and then just write down maybe even write down some just some facts that you find out and then write just write good lists of just random points bad
A	yeah
B	like just
A	oh see the annoying thing is it's it's not even this one that's the hard one
B	no
B	cos you've still got
A	I mean
B	you've still got the other essay you have to do
A	I've still got the big one
B	in the back of your mind
A	yeah
B	so
A	oh I just wish I could get this done you know?
B	mm
B	I know you will be able to get it done
A	oh I dunno
B	mm
A	was the thing that made me leave last year and it's the thing that's made me like worry all of this year
B	mm
A	and doing that and like actually getting something done would be like a massive massive massive like achievement
B	exactly
A	but that that's what makes it so difficult
B	exactly
A	such a stupid little essay and it'll be such a massive thing oh
B	er
A	erm before three o'clock
B	Wednesday before three o'clock
A	so I really wanna get it done on Tuesday which is like
B	okay
A	tomorrow
B	yeah
A	the other one you know I don't wanna have to worry about that cos I'm still gonna have like I'm only gonna have like three days to do the other one
B	okay mm
A	and that's really scary that's not enough time
B	I mean I made I I'd plan your essay like make a plan tonight maybe not even like write the essay out but I mean like plan like what points you're gonna make like just like

B	one away
A	dippers these were extra special

B	oh I'm sorry
A	lightly dusted
B	I'm sorry
A	chicken goujons
B	oh goujon okay
C	oh did you do you want er
B	wow
C	is that why you only had two? it's cos you dropped the rest of the
A	cos I dropped one
C	the oven gloves are right there
A	I know I what happened was I opened the thing dropped the tray the chicken lightly dusted goujons fell onto
B	mm mm
A	er the lower oven tray thing and then one of like went underneath it
C	mm
A	cos it has like a window and then it's got like a kind of gap
C	mm
A	so one of them went under there and I couldn't get it so I had to tip it back up after I'd got the other two put them on the baking tray erm and then I just chucked that one away cos there was like a hair on it
C	oh so you only lost one?
B	mm
A	so I only lost one but I only had three in in the first place cos I eaten the
B	that's cool
A	and then I just picked up the tray with my hand and realised what I'd done and then dropped it
A	and now I'm probably gonna have a blister somewhere
B	oh yeah cos you burnt yourself
A	not really that bad actually
C	yeah cos I erm
A	I do have quite a high tolerance to be honest to like to pain
B	burns and stuff yeah
A	or just pain in general really
C	yeah cos I erm I was just taking some stuff out of the baking tray
B	mm
C	and
A	I'm so clumsy
C	get it on my plate and I and I my hand met the edge of the thing for like a second but it was already
A	no I probably like had it in my hand but was holding it like just I'd just forgotten that it was hot
B	mm
A	and I was like oh hang on
C	yeah well
A	it wasn't good
C	mm
A	we should go Christmas shopping
C	yeah
A	when it's Christmas
B	in
A	like a weekend shopping together
B	yeah
A	presents for everyone
C	oh yeah
B	that would be
A	they've already got lights up
C	oh I'm really excited erm cos like er Christmas time
A	oh I'm so jealous
C	fucking
A	for Christmas
B	they do it really nicely
A	they do
A	we've never been there during Christmas I've always wanted to go
C	decorated like the John Lewis thing it's like they put like huge displays up
B	mm
C	it's really cool it's
B	it must feel really Christmassy in
C	mm
B	you know when sometimes you just don't feel like Christmas happens?
A	yeah
B	like did you feel like Christmas came last year?
C	yeah I did yeah I definitely
B	yeah
C	I I prefer the run-up to Christmas to Christmas
B	yeah rather than Christmas Day
C	erm more purely because I'm not in
B	where do you grandparents live?
A	do you go there every year?
C	yeah
B	oh okay
C	we have to go they're too old to travel we never used to we used to erm like take turns so I've had Christmas at my house a couple of times but now it's not possible for my grandpa to like go anywhere
B	mm
C	really so and I just don't like going my parents and my mum hates it I mean like mm I see where she's coming from
B	oh yeah you said this yeah
C	and yeah we don't get anything kind of back on the same sort of level and I don't like you know you can't really give someone a thirty pound gift and expect a thirty pound one in return if you don't have thirty pounds to spend her argument is is why don't we get them some cheap crap like when they get us cheap crap? erm
B	mm
C	some of the presents are like really excessive
B	I mean how much how much do you spend on them?
C	well one time I bought my cousin a camera I mean so I dunno how much that was probably about fifty quid or something but erm
B	yeah yeah
C	and like I got like a pair of like earrings like from Claire's Accessories and I mean I think it's that kind of like I feel like it should be closer
B	mm
C	kind of
B	yeah that it should be less of a gap
A	well I mean no one wants earrings from Claire's Accessories
C	it wasn't well actually
C	from Claire's Accessories like erm like you know if
B	mm
C	on the cushion like not that kind of erm just like some drug store generic things
B	mm
C	but erm
B	are they very well off?
C	my parents yeah but not them
B	oh yeah
C	no no no not them
B	yeah
C	erm which is why I think my dad spends so much I think he kind of has this weird guilt about being kind of like us being like the
B	the richer family
C	rich extended family and they're not like his sister like literally shovels horse shit for a living and she makes like ten grand a year
B	is she a farmer?
C	shovelling crap
B	oh right she works at like stables and things?
C	yeah
B	that's what I meant I didn't mean a farmer
C	no no no well you know
B	cos farmers are well they don't make loads but they make a alright amount of money
C	mm
B	I've always been a bit wary of horses myself
C	I've always been cos I went horseriding when I was younger like I
B	you've been safe around horses
C	I'm not yeah I'm not kind of
B	yeah
C	er
B	cows you you don't see much of cows probably do you?
C	no
B	cos like you know when we were doing about the evacuees like they'd never seen a cow
B	that's like you
C	what fucking idiot's never seen a cow? but like well to be fair now I have seen cows like you know obviously you do leave London occasionally go on holiday to places where there are cows
B	whereas in my school it was like who the fuck's never seen a cow before?
B	basically
A	where would you go on holiday somewhere with cows?
C	I dunno if erm
B	Wales there they have sheep and cows
A	or like
C	we used to go on holiday to Wales
A	like France you know Spain
C	there's lots of cows
B	it has sunflowers
A	yeah
C	if the
B	and fields
A	oh yeah I suppose it does yeah
C	oh yeah no everywhere everywhere pretty much farms cows
A	mm
C	all the Nordic countries do cos nothing
A	mm
C	actually grows there so
B	isn't it?
C	no
B	what is it?
C	mm I think it's French or something something I dunno generic and it's erm European
B	I was gonna say Spanish because it's a red cow
C	I think it might actually be Spanish
C	I dunno well I mean it's an on
A	well it's a woman isn't it I suppose
B	yeah it's a female cow
B	oh I love the adverts when we were younger
C	oh I remember going to
B	they're so shit now
C	a farm when I was we went to a farm in year seven and for our geography and it's like
B	nightmare
C	if you're like already kind of like grossed out out about like outdoors and like farms and things like being in
B	do they have farms in
C	no all this was outside of
B	oh okay
C	in
B	oh definitely
C	and I think I was too
B	I don't agree with animal farming at all
C	I think I was too grossed out about the animal shit to like actually I mean like maybe like a cow would have like it was it wasn't like the really horrific pictures that you see but it was like maybe from here this corner to halfway down this table like that corner was the size that a cow would have
B	mm
C	by itself and then all like separated as well so they couldn't like walk around and talk to each other or anything not that they would cos they're cows but you know what I mean
B	mm
C	really really gross but it was really fucking gross
B	how far away was the farm like from where you lived?
C	just outside
B	so like
C	and just like it was barely like it's almost in London
B	oh okay so you didn't have to go like two hours to find a farm?
C	er
B	it doesn't go like that no
C	yeah it it was kind of quite
B	mm
C	like you can cos it kind of like London has sort of like a lot of growths basically like little tumours of like places that sort of been er really like villages on their own and then that has gotten so close to London they even become part of London and then
B	mm
C	obviously that's kind of coming that way and that's coming out that way so you can be like not in London
B	mm
C	but you'd be surrounded by London on two sides or something so
B	that's cool
C	basically
A	hiya
B	hello
C	not crazy but like he doesn't really know where he is anymore and so that's kind of shit and then my grandma just doesn't like me
B	mm
C	and I don't really like her so
unknown_female	mm got to start cooking I don't want to
C	I'm so tempted to make chicken nuggets just because it's easy
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I don't think she likes me though
C	yeah
B	who's this?
B	is this
C	I don't think it's
C	well probably she probably hears all those shit stuff it was like you tend when you when you talk to someone about people you tend like if they're being nice or whatever you don't really say anything but when they're annoying you you do
B	mm
C	so like you tend to hear all the shit stuff cos I came in and she already knew about
B	oh really?
B	so now every time I see her I just kind of hear
C	I don't really hear her cos I'm not I've got er a little weird cupboard a boiler I think between me and
B	oh yeah
C	although I'm next to you
B	you're next to me
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
unknown_female	just have the
C	I've got the
B	I don't think anyone's next to you
C	I'm not next I've got a cupboard and then I've got you
B	oh you yeah you've got the cupboard
C	where's
C	I'm very like
B	he gets so he's
unknown_female	I
B	he's next to
C	no
B	is he not next to
C	no that's
B	no
C	that's
B	oh okay so it's
A	is
B	it goes
A	really?
B	no it goes me
A	no
C	no
B	I'd
B	I swear
A	yeah
B	but that's why
A	no no it goes it goes it goes
C	and
A	erm and you
C	no no
A	and
C	on the right
A	there's another two on that side and
C	oh
A	oh
C	and there's one there
A	also next
C	yeah yeah you're next to
A	yeah but no one's next to me
C	yeah okay but all the cupboards everyone's got a cupboard next to them
A	yeah but I have one either side of me don't I? or is someone like exactly next to me?
C	no no one's exactly next to you but I'm no one none of us are exactly next to anyone
B	mm
A	oh
C	apart from you and
A	apart from
B	yeah me and
C	I'm next to
unknown_female	or
C	exactly next to the person from flat one
B	mm
C	whoever's on that side but I think everyone else has got cupboards in between them cos I thought they were empty rooms sort of thing but I do think we have a couple of empty rooms
A	we have had a single empty room yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	cos no one wants to be in
C	is it?
A	of the accommodations
C	I thought it was
A	yeah those as well but like
B	mm
unknown_female	yeah
unknown_female	hiya
B	hello
unknown_female	hi
B	mm
C	ah okay ah
C	yeah
B	uhu
C	her name is
D	oh
C	she doesn't like me I don't think
D	oh
B	why why don't you think she likes you?
C	because like I was here chatting and I'd like turned around to like be at the sink or whatever and I can hear like I could see them in the window exchanging
B	I felt a bit like that when
C	that's not nice
B	like don't take offence like it's
C	no I'm not offended I just don't think she likes me at all I don't care
B	she was also being like a bit like funny when he was cooking his dinner like she was like rubbing up and down and I was like
B	it's like if you wanna have sexy time just don't do it by a hot stove because it makes me anxious
B	like cos
B	and it was like you know
C	I'm not a sexy
B	she was literally she was literally just like
B	she was just like
B	a bit like well not quite but it's like
B	literally that
A	there's good like er pelvic work going on there
B	yeah it was so good it was so funny but I was just like okay I'm just gonna go and eat my food
A	I felt really awful cos I really wanted to do my washing up but they were in here eating and I was like
B	yeah you feel a bit like
A	and then I thought you're the you're the only one in there and they're on the table like just yeah being
D	that's
A	well I washed up anyway
C	mm
B	you washed up anyway
A	yeah I wanted to wash up
C	I haven't washed up yet
A	so I thought I mean if I wash up I have to use it again
unknown_female	mm
C	I know
A	I hate being an adult
B	me too
C	I wanna dishwasher do you know how much better like how
A	do you think you're gonna move out next year?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	definitely
A	I thought you'd say that
C	I just wanna be in charge
A	me as well
C	our own
A	yeah
C	stuff like I wanna
B	mm
A	I don't think you'd get a dishwasher though you'd be lucky
C	oh no I don't I I'm okay with that but like
D	could buy one though or you can just ask your
A	you could buy one but
B	mm
D	ask ask your landlord
A	yeah you've got to ask the landlord
D	they've probably got a landlord here
A	if you want something like that
C	or but like say for example I would much rather
C	be in a flat with like say three other people and then all chip in to get a decent
D	mm
C	ironing board that's better than the crap that we have here now
A	I haven't used it but
B	it is crap to be honest
C	I haven't used it because it's crap like
B	mm mm
C	like I just don't have any like I purposely buy clothes that don't need to be ironed so I avoid ironing
B	how many contact hours do we have next year?
A	stupid
B	less?
unknown_female	yeah
B	I'm assuming cos there's
D	it depends what class you're in
C	you'll yeah fewer contact hours
A	well you'll still have like a seminar a week for your thing and then a couple of lectures surely because I don't feel like you have a lot
C	it means I don't have to go out in the rain to do my washing
A	mm
C	so like get really
A	yeah but you have to get the bus all the way up to campus whenever you have to come on campus
B	that's the thing
C	that's the maybe that's true that's true
B	and er that's what I'm worried out
D	to be fair I mean it
B	like missing your coursework
D	it doesn't
B	deadline and having to
D	it doesn't make any
B	run in but you couldn't cos you missed the bus or the bus
D	cos you think that it's even if it's ten fifteen minutes
A	oh I know yeah that's
D	and the sort of
C	I might get a car
B	yeah
C	I might I might learn how to drive in that case
B	mm
C	I can just take nick my mum's car she doesn't like it like anyway she'll get a new one I'll nick hers
B	cos you think yeah I always think about moving out but then again I feel like
C	well that's what I wanna do I just
D	it it it costs two hundred and fifty pounds for three
A	but then think about how nice it would be to have like a little flat family and have like
B	it would be nice
A	like TV
C	oh like be near a Sainsbury's
B	or like a lounge
C	so I can actually carry my Coke load
A	you could have a little lounge and it would just be
A	your house
B	mm
C	that I wanna bring
A	I think I would move out
C	eighteen cans is not that bad this time it was better than when I was thirty-two I think that was manageable
B	mm
D	like yeah I've got two of them
A	I
B	yeah
C	mm
C	along with everything else I was
A	is this all yours?
D	it it wasn't that hard to carry
C	mm?
A	is this all yours?
C	yeah I just I'm preparing myself
D	what are you making?
C	mentally to do some cooking
C	but it will be cooked I haven't done it yet but it's all out
A	no I don't think so
B	no you have to stay in your college
A	cos you have to reapply for this anywhere cos it
B	yeah
A	cos people first years would wanna get in there as well and they probably have first pick
C	well I'd say if we applied for like
B	er you have to stay in your college
B	you have to when you when you're assigned a college you have to stay
A	yeah
B	in your college
C	yeah no I would then I would rather the only reason I I would consider moving is if I was considered staying is if we moved college
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I don't want to think about
C	yeah I did think
B	I think that
C	I wanted to stay here next year but I'm not I'm starting to think like not sure cos I don't really feel like the campus offers anything that you couldn't get living outside
B	yeah
C	like
B	I mean the only thing
B	keeping me here is the thought of like lectures just being very
A	just being
B	like cos literally you
A	but they're not even that close to be honest
B	yeah
A	to us like they still take twenty minutes to get to like
B	mm
A	when you're walking
B	yeah
A	especially to like
B	cos I'm just thinking how early you'd have to get up in the morning like to get a bus and then walk from the
A	yeah
B	bus to campus and then if you missed the bus say rather than just you could just run to a lecture kind of thing
A	but then again like most people in second year like my sister like most people in her year she said didn't go to the lectures they just went to seminars
B	okay
A	cos lectures just weren't important like you could just look them up
B	mm
A	they just have PowerPoints
B	yeah yeah
A	I suppose that's
B	mm
A	you know you know
C	I mean there there are fewer of them and then if you had like a few for the whole day you would just stay on campus for the day to
A	well yeah exactly
C	kind of to work just
A	just stay and do your work
B	that's true you could just stay there
C	you'll only you'll only be doing
B	yeah
C	like three trips a day like how we do you would just stay
B	for the day that's true actually
C	I mean it
B	yeah
A	if you think about it there are people in our year who live in like
B	and it'll be cheaper won't it to live in a house than this?
A	oh so much cheaper like
B	mm
C	I want a nice one though
A	in England
C	with a dishwasher
B	a nice one with a dishwasher
A	I'm not sure I think dishwashers might
C	I want a double bed but
A	yeah you could get a double bed
B	some of them some of them have
A	my sister has a double bed
B	yeah some of them
B	yeah
D	I don't mind paying
A	you've just gotta get in really quickly
C	I would be willing to pay
B	mm
D	I'd want something really modern and
A	well what are we paying now? something
B	yeah state of the art
D	yeah
A	about two hundred and twenty? you'd be paying less than that in a house I reckon
D	you'd be paying less than this this is really expensive
A	yeah they're really expensive yeah
D	this is like you may not think
C	do you wanna know how expensive like a flat in
D	no
A	I don't
C	I saw an article about it
B	hundred and seventy
D	no
C	hundred and seventy pounds a month?
B	a week
unknown_female	a week
D	no no no you you can get something decent for about two fifty I think
A	oh no
D	something like this for about two fifty I'd say
A	two fifty a week you'd say?
D	probably yeah
C	it's about two thousand
B	a week?
D	a week?
A	fuck
C	a week
D	like here
C	no a month a month a month
D	oh right
A	I was gonna say two thousand a week?
C	no no no no no
A	I would have been
C	but like it's like it's like four hundred I think a week normally
B	that's
C	that's crazy that
B	what for students?
C	no
B	or just for living?
C	no well no just like an average flat
B	okay
A	that's what it's like in
C	well to be fair if you were if you were a student it's
B	it would still be expensive
C	it's quite likely you'd get special you would have to get whatever flat is
B	yeah
C	if I actually how do you do I don't think anyone does student housing I think people would probably stay on campus if they wanted to go to a
A	mm
C	I think a great deal of people that go to
A	yeah not many of them have like that much accommodation
C	most people most people will just
B	mm
C	live at home for the whole
A	yeah
C	that's what I would do
A	I know some people from
B	oh my god
A	and they were at one of the best universities in like pretty much the world like it was really crazy like
D	for for here like this area it's quite expensive already
A	mm
B	what in
A	I thought it was quite cheap here
D	one two six a week?
A	I thought it was like eighty a week or something
D	one two six a week?
A	no
D	one two six a week for
A	oh oh oh here?
D	what for what we're getting here?
A	that can't yeah
B	is ours
A	oh yeah that's a bit
B	one two six or one three four?
C	why is our one more expensive than everyone else?
B	because on
A	I don't think mine's one two
B	on
D	one two six
D	but I think they obviously
A	mine's definitely not that
B	it's what?
D	maybe do it
C	my one's one one eight
A	yeah so's mine
D	what's yours?
C	one one eight
D	one one eight a week?
B	one one eight?
C	yeah
D	one one
A	it's cos we have a lower a shorter lease and we've got a lot of disabled rooms as well
D	I think mine's shorter lease
B	is yours a thirty-six week? I think that's mine
C	I think it's
B	as well
C	I think yeah my one is for
D	but I'm paying
B	and the thirty-six
C	I thought it was
A	if you have to move out in
B	mm
A	then you've got a shorter lease as well
B	okay so it's one one eight? pounds?
A	yeah
D	yeah so is mine I've got a shorter lease but
B	okay
D	it's still one two six
C	but I've got a
B	I thought it was
C	I've got fourteen weeks on mine for one one eight
B	oh okay
A	oh
B	that's strange
A	that's weird I don't know how it works out
C	oh I just think that and like I've seen other accommodation and it is exactly the same it's like it is the complete
D	there's
C	like a
A	and a pin board
B	mm
C	no but like in their room a girl like a little one
A	mm
C	by where the coat hanger is
A	oh ah
C	yeah that is the only difference and she's got a really nice view
A	what colour's our carpet then if hers is blue?
C	purple
B	purple
A	oh god it is I hate our carpet
C	I actually don't mind it cos it matches my
A	I'd love to be higher up
B	mm
C	erm she basically opened it's like a like a very narrow carpark that's just got a load of trees in front of it so she just sees tree tops from her window
A	mm mm
C	and she that's so nice cos I see a path
C	I see a busy path
A	I just wanna live in
A	and like the townhouses in
C	mm?
A	I just wanna live in a
C	everyone I meet is in
B	yeah they are everyone's in
A	I wouldn't wanna live in
C	yeah
B	they look quite nice
D	yeah yeah
B	the houses
A	yeah yeah
B	but yeah
D	from on the pictures online of the
B	oh okay yeah
D	cos they do look a bit
A	I don't think they have enough online pictures
B	no
A	for accommodation
B	I can't remember what
D	it's exactly what
A	I don't know if I've got one at all
D	it's exactly what the like what my room looks like so
A	I think I applied to
D	three?
A	somewhere else
D	I've thought it was two
B	mm
C	yeah you can apply for two
A	oh was it two? well those two then
D	mine was
C	mm
C	yeah same cos I just I couldn't be bothered so I just put in superior en suite
D	yeah
C	and then just went for the first two and it was alphabetical so
D	mm
C	came up first and I was like yeah
B	mm
C	that's fine
D	I don't like
C	and then I I actually look on yeah
B	mm
D	it's not actually that far it feels longer when it's raining but it's
C	yeah but I was just thinking like
A	yeah you could have
C	just have
A	couldn't you? you could have
C	yeah
A	gone anywhere
B	mm
C	and I didn't I just
A	mm
C	didn't think I was just went
A	like with me I I applied for the superior en suite and I wish I hadn't now cos
D	well
A	I don't actually care now about en suite I think I would rather have a shared cos I did at
D	but it depends on your room yeah
C	well and
A	no there's was never a problem like nobody was ever waiting for showers or
B	mm
A	it was never like really dirty or leaking or anything like that and it's just like having a toilet in your room it's a bit of faff cos mine leaks all the time like the shower and it just
C	yeah I wish we had like proper cleaners and
A	and you have to clean and it's just like a bit annoying
B	mm
A	like cos they clean the toilets
C	someone cleans
A	for you when they're not yours
B	mm
C	no at at
A	yeah
C	er once a week and the cleaner cleans the kitchen and does all the like entirely like a proper clean and they come and clean the bathrooms as well
D	yeah they do it here as well in
[ANNOTATION]	they have someone who cleans the house	Entailment
A	but
C	they clean the bathrooms?
D	yeah
B	oh
C	why am I not in
D	well no
D	a lot it's our room they they clean them every day
C	wait are you in the superior en suite?
D	no like
C	no that's what I what I'm saying
D	it it's shared
D	oh right
C	he had a bathtub and a toilet and a cleaner came into his room personally and cleaned his own bathroom for him
[ANNOTATION]	speaker d is in the suite	Contradiction
B	mm
D	yeah that's nice
B	does
C	no it's completely en suite that's why like it's quite popular
B	mm cos I probably won't be able to afford this next year to be honest
A	mm
B	like if I stay here
D	yeah I'll maybe like just
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b doesn't have enough money to live there anymore	Entailment
C	I had to take this cos it was like
D	this
C	I was on clearing so I wouldn't have had another option but they said on the thing like it's
D	for what we're getting this is really expensive
C	it's
D	for a little room that I've got
C	no it really doesn't feel superior to me in any way
D	yeah
C	yeah it
[ANNOTATION]	they think they are being charged too much	Entailment
D	well you've got
A	well what is er what is the difference between this one and
D	is it?
C	it must be
A	yeah they don't have a
[ANNOTATION]	they are staying there for studies	Neutral
C	yeah
A	we do that's it that's the only difference I thought it meant we'd get a bathtub
A	wanted a bathtub
C	well didn't you
B	you were that's a bit ambitious
A	well no cos my only experience of student accommodation was
B	mm
A	but that's very rare
C	well I didn't know that
B	I've never heard of anyone have a bathtub
C	I literally know
B	I've never heard that that's crazy
A	I know there's this cool person at university and they had a bathtub so and literally
C	mm
B	mm
A	I mean I did try and lower my expectations cos uni halls in general are just shit they
D	I don't think this is as that bad
A	but it's not as bad as it could have been like we could have got you know
B	yeah like some people have like mould growing on the walls
A	yeah
D	do you know like that
A	well I have mould in my bathroom
D	like like the best for the last couple of years?
C	yeah
A	yeah I dread to think what standard accommodation
D	for our accommodation
A	is like if this is considered superior though like
B	mm
A	it must be really shit
C	but that's almost like
A	mm
B	it looks nice from the outside
A	no no it looks a bit like an old people's
B	no but it's
A	I I said it looked like very nice erm like a luxury housing estate in soviet Russia
A	it does it like
B	it does a bit
A	think about it
B	yeah yeah
B	like it looks very
D	it looks nice from outside I think
C	a luxury
B	looks like a
C	housing estate in soviet Russia
A	well we have quite a nice place like I like where our location is
C	cos it's all very samey and like communisty looking like all the
A	we have a good
B	mm
A	like this house is good in relation to where everything else is like cos just up there that's the way to
B	why do
A	and there's no cars here
unknown_female	mm
B	most people in third year move back then?
C	no I would have I would have prefer to
C	I would have preferred a building down there cos like
unknown_female	mm
C	you do not have the main path that goes with the uni ground outside your room like I see people moving to their lectures
C	every day like I I can't remember the last time
A	yeah that's
C	I opened my curtains I actually can't
C	yeah yeah you walk past most curtains will be closed
A	yeah I always have artificial light in my room
D	I thought you put a net up
C	er?
D	I thought you got a
C	can't even be bothered to put it back up again it fell down and I haven't
A	it would have been nice if we'd been on like the top floor cos you can see out to the other side from that side
C	oh yeah ideally I would have liked to have been on the top floor on that side
B	mm
C	mm closer to everything else
D	I wouldn't wanna live out there
C	no cos they go
B	no
C	all the way down and they go all the way down that way as well
A	mm yeah
C	really? I think
D	yeah that would
C	to me because it's all the way down there
A	yeah but the it's it's like it's erm it's actually one less bus or two less bus stops if you think about it
C	yeah yeah the bus never comes
unknown_female	mm
B	how come people move back here in third year then? didn't
A	I think
unknown_female	oh
A	cos he's a rep he got to but I'm not sure how else
B	he
A	how else you could do it really
D	third year can if you apply
A	you can?
D	yeah if you applied early
unknown_female	yeah
B	cos they say a lot of third years do
A	yeah
B	for some reason maybe it's cos you get a lot of contact hours or something
D	not a lot of work to be you would be in the library quite a lot
B	that's the thing yeah like
A	well I've got a printer
B	it is handy having the library there to just
A	I need to find out what printer you have cos my dad said that he'd buy me one and
C	it's a HP Pavilion
A	I wanna find one that has cheap ink
B	mm
unknown_female	I know
D	I've got an Epson
B	oh yeah I've got that one at home
C	I have an Epson at home as well but I I want like a particular one that I know will come with cheap ink cos sometimes you can get ink and it costs like forty quid or something
A	yeah mine was virtually but it was like thirty quid for the printer and the ink cost
B	that's really good
unknown_female	about twenty quid
D	is it a
A	yeah
D	would it be a
A	it's not bad actually it's got a scanner
D	it would be a
A	and a
