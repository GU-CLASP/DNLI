C	yeah somebody must make we need to search on the whole web
A	we do
C	now we know what we're asking for it's a one inch two three no three quarter to one inch adapter
A	yeah three quarter female
C	well I think if you put three quarter to one inch adapter it will pick it up won't it?
A	yeah but you got to know the how many threads it is
C	the lathe well the lathes are all the same aren't they?
A	I dunno
C	I would have though they were the same
A	yeah yeah yeah they probably would be
C	they're probably all the same
B	it should be standard shouldn't they?
C	yeah so its proper cream cheese here
A	oh yeah
C	and you haven't opened it?
B	that's alright I'll finish off the old one
C	why do you buy? oh I'll use that one
B	no it's alright
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think the old one is better for him	Entailment
C	do you buy Philadelphia rather than?
A	when it's cheap
C	when it's cheap? which it is sometimes actually
B	it was half price
A	it was half price
B	mm
C	was it? why do they do that do you know I?
B	I don't know the the the last it's to get the rid of the stock isn't it? that's the idea
C	oh it's getting near out of date
B	yeah
C	so they want to clear it up that's what it is yeah
B	they can't keep it there forever
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said because the date of expiration they could not keep it forever	Entailment
C	but but to actually do it as a promotion they must have a lot of stock
B	mm
A	they must do
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agrees with Person C about the promotions	Entailment
C	but I suppose they must have a lot of stock when you think of Tesco's as a whole
A	yeah
C	they must have oodles of stock
B	they must do yeah such a difficult thing to do isn't it? stock up a supermarket really hard work it must be
C	well
B	I don't like it
C	I reckon practically all of its computerised now
A	this is out of date next month
B	oh I see so that when you go through the checkout they know before
A	that's February January February
C	well you've got a Tesco's card haven't you?
[ANNOTATION]	Person C  was followed by the guy was taken picture by him	Contradiction
A	this is seventeenth of the fourth
B	I think mm
A	yeah so it's
B	that's April
A	yeah but it's ain't near nearly out of date is it?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said they have time to use them	Neutral
C	that depends how many they've got
A	yeah
C	cos at at the checkout it also it also cos you use your card your Tesco card it knows your shopping pattern
A	yeah
C	so it knows that you buy Philadelphia in June and July
B	clever oh yeah I suppose they do
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	so it knows when you shop at
A	that's right to accommodate us
C	yeah and if you stop shopping there you'll come off that
C	so I'm guessing they've got quite sophisticated computerised stock control
B	yeah I guess they must have
C	so I doubt that they would if that's effective then they're not going to have loads of stock lots of stock that's near its sell-by date
B	but when it comes to like seasons like like today Valentine's day
C	yeah
B	they've had to bring in loads and loads of flowers haven't they? red roses and things
C	mm well they know what they sold last year
B	they do but they don't know if Tesco's is doing a better deal than Morrison's or whatever
C	mm
B	or Lidl even
C	yeah
B	it's difficult isn't it? cos they're all trying to fight they all think they're gonna sell loads but it doesn't really mean that
A	the buyers have a heck of a job don't they?
B	they do don't they? it must be difficult
A	and if you're a good buyer then you're worth a lot of money at Tesco's or Morrison's
B	if you sell at the right price
A	but they must be I
C	mm it's what you get used to innit? those bank dealers that were
A	oh yeah
C	moving
A	moving
C	millions and millions around every day it's just a number
A	yeah
B	it is yeah
A	and they've been they don't have any conscience anyway so they didn't care anyway that's the whole point about being a a an entrepreneur type person all you've got is
C	oh yeah mm mm that's what you're doing you're dealing
A	never mind you
C	and I would argue that's one thing that the Eastern Muslims have got right and we've got wrong cos er a Muslims you're not allowed to invest the invest your money in a bank if it's not a risk
A	oh right
C	so you can't just invest your money knowing I get four percent return
B	right
C	you can invest your money in a business
B	mm
C	and if it does well you get a return if it doesn't you don't
B	like shares then
C	yeah exactly you're not allowed to make money that's usury in their mind
A	yeah
C	making money without any risk is wrong
B	mm
C	and I think it is
B	yeah
C	but most of our income in this country is done exactly like that
A	but if you are a Muslim in this country as well you put you get ten percent of your money to the church
C	of your income
A	yeah
C	no it's of your total wealth
A	is it your total wealth or
C	mm mm
B	wow
A	each year
C	I thought it went to charity
B	ten percent of your total wealth
C	mm
B	alright we've got we've got a house that doesn't mean to say we could afford to afford to put ten percent of this in
A	no we couldn't
C	yes but it's not income it's total wealth
A	yeah
B	that's what I mean this is this counts as total wealth though isn't it?
C	I suppose so I don't know
A	so we
B	so how would we afford to put in a percentage
C	you wouldn't
B	mm
C	mm I'm pretty sure it's not income it's wealth
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well the Muslims we we we knew they were they shared everything even the kids
B	mm
A	even the children
C	even the
A	the children
B	they all looked after everyone else's
A	they were all looked after
C	oh yeah
A	by the whole community
C	well that that's the same with er with the Jewish religion
A	yeah
C	the Kibbutz
B	yeah
A	they were lovely people with the kids
B	and any money that that's in the pool they have a pool don't they of money as well
C	yeah
B	not just religion is it?
A	they help each other out
B	if someone want to borrow some money
C	now erm you remember
B	mm
C	right when they came over when they were Ugandan
B	right
C	but Idi Amin had kicked them out
A	ooh yeah
B	right
C	right and what they did when they arrived they all agreed to put in so much per month into the kitty and then they had a raffle to see who bought their own house first
A	ooh yeah
B	oh I see yeah
C	right so they all paid in and it was luck of the draw who got the house first
B	right
C	erm er and so their joint money you didn't borrow money to get a mortgage right? you were borrowing it for each other for nothing
B	yeah
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	that's very similar to that er
B	it's good if it works
A	collective
C	well no money going out you see
A	yeah yeah there was a group of people who had the land they've bought bought the land and each of these people about ten pairs built each other's house
C	oh right yeah
B	they all had different skills didn't they?
A	they all
C	they're
B	opticians plumber bricklayer they they made sure they all had different skills
C	it sometimes doesn't work cos one of them is lazier than the others or
B	yeah cos as soon as one gets their house you tend to
A	they don't want to do it any more
C	no no
B	yeah and there's always someone that works harder than the others isn't there?
C	I don't begrudge it
B	mm
C	you know fair enough
B	it's good if it works mm
A	this is a massive gherkin
B	they are they're huge
C	cucumbers
A	mm
B	yeah they are cucumbers true
A	yeah
B	mm
A	they're a bit rougher on the outside than the cucumbers though
C	gherkins are always prickly aren't they?
B	mm we have grown them before
C	I have as well
B	mm never got round to pickling them really
C	well you don't get a lot of it and
B	no
C	perhaps they don't grow them well enough perhaps I should erm be more intense with the growth you know water them more feed them more
A	yeah with a cucumber you're only supposed to leave so many on the plant aren't you? just for like a a
B	mm after so many leaves you have to nip rip nip it out and it's difficult
A	well it the same with tomatoes you can nip em out when you got four
C	you mean four trusses yeah
C	probably should do cos the the young trusses never come to much
A	they don't know
B	I do me do but them off when they get top of the glass
C	right
B	I do chop them then
C	now why do you isn't this one expensive or do you get this on special offer?
A	no that is expensive yeah
B	no we try to get it when it's reduced at the moment
A	it go it used it used to be a pound piece now it's gone up to one pound
B	sixteen
A	sixteen
C	but you can make your own
B	you can we have as well
A	we have made our own yeah
B	that is nice
C	is that your your liquidiser?
A	yeah
C	your own could be nicer
A	but we're if you read the
C	yeah some tomatoes that are going a bit soggy in the fridge
A	yeah
C	er and then it says vegetable juice right okay so eighty-nine percent tomato juice
B	yeah I know
C	it's practically all tomato juice
B	yeah
C	and you can get that for half the price
A	and there's carrot and there's celery
C	and then there's ten percent of carrot celery beetroot parsley lettuce watercress spinach
A	yeah we have yeah
C	both of them
B	it's good value though there's an awful lot of tomato in here
C	eighty-nine percent tomato well you can buy
B	yeah but but a whole carton is a lot of tomato juice
C	yeah I suppose so
B	we we actually only have you've seen those little
C	yeah sorry I've had two glasses of it
B	tank tankards
B	so yeah so we limit ourselves here I reckon reckon that it takes two weeks
C	oh right well I just finished that
A	no but what we do now with this
C	you cut it up
A	well see that goes down and
B	there's plenty in there left you won't have to top it up again
C	you top it up?
B	we tip it up again to get it out again won't you?
C	no he's got it he's got it up so it's tipped up already
B	yeah
A	and you and you don't tip it right out you tip in on the side
B	alright
A	alright? that's how we've always done it
C	didn't you know that
A	well you're looking looking at me as though I'm daft
B	yeah when we when we think the whole thing is empty
A	well that's what I thought it was empty till we shook it and then at that
C	I thought it was empty yeah
B	yeah empty
C	cos passata now passata in if you buy passata
B	mm
C	you can get passata for thirty P
B	can you? that's cheap
C	it is isn't it? and it's really thick
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are in Italy	Neutral
C	and to be honest to turn it into tomato juice you would that
A	mm
B	yeah we did have our own tomato juice the other day didn't we?
A	yeah we did
C	erm do you think tomato juice is the bit that comes out? cos when you when you when I process my tomatoes I use processed tomato juice for a soup a lot of it separates out
A	it does
C	in the jar
A	yeah
C	quiet distinctly
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they want to make a pasta dish	Neutral
C	you know you get yellowy watery bit
A	that's right
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c uses processed tomato juice for cooking	Entailment
C	and the tomato so do you think when they make tomato juice they squeeze the tomatoes and the juice that runs off is the tomato juice and then they make passata out the rest?
A	they might do that yeah
C	mm cos passata is sieved tomatoes
A	yeah
C	so the pips and the skin don't get through
B	mm we think this is er basically sieved as well cos if you zhuzh up I don't know like how you could use this but if you zhuzh up tomatoes you still get the little bits can't get rid of them
C	not if I no not if I do it in the in the amazing bullet thing
B	really? it makes it really
C	yeah
A	oh you've got a bullet have you?
C	an amazing bullet
B	it that good?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c doesn't have a bullet	Contradiction
C	not a Nurtibullet
A	not a Nurtibullet
C	Nutribullets cost a hundred quid
B	right
C	my amazing bullet was less than thirty pounds
A	oh right
C	it's good actually I use
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c bought a bullet for a hundred pounds	Contradiction
B	is it?
C	yeah it's got two actually got more than two but it's got two basic you can use it as a liquidiser separately it's got a you know a a sort of mini liquidiser thing you can use it as a juicer it's got a juicer attachment
B	ooh right
C	okay and then it's got two different blade cutters one's for liquidiser doing Nutribullet drinks basically and the other one's for chopping up hard things
A	oh right
C	so I use it as a coffee grinder
A	oh do you?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c has many uses for their bullet	Entailment
C	I don't buy ground coffee any more I buy beans
A	yeah
C	right? and you just put a little bit I the bottom of the thing cos it's got little it's got little er not legs but little things so it stands when you stand it upside down
B	right
C	you unscrew the base put your beans up screw it up turn it round the other way it's because it's upside down that it works so well you see and then you just push and turn and twenty seconds I've got ground coffee
A	brilliant
C	and it's fresh ground coffee
A	we used to have a lovely coffee grinder and I found it one day and melted in the oven
C	in the oven?
A	mm
B	no you haven't
C	was that you then?
B	it was I put it in there to dry
C	oh right okay
B	in our little
C	now there was a guy who erm
B	I stupidly
C	didn't like his hamster any more he put it in the microwave
B	ooh dear
C	yeah? to kill it cos he obviously couldn't bare it any longer
A	right
C	no he he got sent to jail for nine weeks
B	really?
C	he was in prison for nine weeks
A	what did he tell people that he did it did he?
C	no somebody must have found out or
A	yeah oh gosh
A	yeah
C	but there are people who steal cars who get suspended sentences
B	they're
C	I think well
A	yeah there's a bloke who put his budgie in the microwave and that did blow up
C	what the budgie or the microwave?
A	that blew the budgie up
C	probably well it's the same if you put meat in there it it cooks doesn't it?
A	yeah and if you don't prick the potatoes that'll go bang
B	and an egg
A	and an egg who put egg in and
B	I don't know someone did and they
A	and that just exploded
C	and egg does yeah
A	the egg just exploded
C	yeah they're actually beginning to bring out I'm just amazed how slow they've been to do it erm microwave specific recipes now
A	oh right yeah
C	things like crème brûlée and so on and how to make them in a microwave
A	yeah
C	they never did microwaves have always been almost always been treated as a sort of a something slightly better than a food warmer
A	yeah
C	and nothing more
B	we use to make out steamed puddings and that in there didn't we?
A	well yeah the
B	two minutes for steam pudding
C	a a steam pudding is five five minutes isn't it?
B	yeah
C	whereas if you steamed it in a ah they have the same
B	they're about the same cos they go hard very quick if you eat it straight fresh it's lovely but you can't keep it
C	oh right okay
B	mm
C	erm
A	really?
B	that sounds different
C	it does yeah yeah twenty-five quid it is so it looks like a well it looks like a flat microwave
B	yeah
C	but it's made out of very rigid plastic it's still got a pressure valve and everything on it
B	mm
A	mm
B	mm
A	well that one it's supposed to be an oven a grill
C	yeah
A	everything you can imagine it's a combi whatever
C	yeah same as we've got yeah
A	and we've all we've done is use the microwave
B	basically
A	superb jacket potatoes
B	yeah but basically it's reheating you know old cooking
A	yeah making cocoa at night
C	scrambled egg I make in the microwave
A	yeah you can do that too
B	much much better than cooked
A	and custard it's easy to make
C	I do custard in the microwave yeah
B	it takes such a long time standing there in a saucepan
C	but I'm sure there are improved ways of cooking in the microwave
B	mm
C	trouble is its size you see really if you're going to cook a meal in the microwave you need four of em
A	yeah there there are new ones out now
C	like a hob you got to treat it like a hob and an oven
A	the new ones out have two two different levels
C	oh yeah
B	well I've got two different levels
C	you can put a shelf in
B	there is a shelf? it's a new larder
C	but you'd need more than that you need the different because it's so short time you need you need four of them to do it all at the same time don't you?
B	yes you do yeah
A	yeah
B	it's useless
C	and it's a different style instead of planning on cooking a meal over an hour you plan cooking a meal over eight minutes
A	yeah yeah
B	but if you're reheating so you've got stuff leftover you're reheating like five people's
A	yeah yeah
C	yeah because you're in and out and in and out
A	yeah
B	mm and then you're not all eating at once so you've got to
A	yeah yes
B	yeah they do go down don't he?
A	it seems to get colder quicker
C	well that's illogical isn't it?
A	it is it is but that's what it seems
C	the only explanation of that must be that it's not fully heated right the way through
A	well it could be
B	that's normally the case
C	microwaves don't heat form the out inside out
A	no they don't know
C	in fact
A	no
C	that's a fallacy
A	but we'll often go through there with our dinner which is steaming hot out of the microwave got through there start to eat it and think ah
C	I think it's because it at a certain foods absorb the microwaves more than others
A	yeah they do yeah
C	get more excited and hot whereas other bits don't
A	mm
C	the same in the one that you know polystyrene doesn't take heat away from your hands so it feels warm
A	yeah
C	that kind of
B	yeah you've got to
C	but yeah I I don't think people ever cook effectively in microwaves until there's you can buy a bank of them that's what they apparently in the real big posh
B	whoops
C	the real big posh restaurants all use a whole bank of they've got a banks of microwaves and they sell you know when you have a erm you know a steam pudding with a chocolate filling inside
A	yeah
C	well you can't be cooking those as they're ordered
A	no
C	they're precooked and the only way you can do it and I think it's because the the dense liquid absorbs the heat
A	yes yeah
C	is in a microwave
A	yeah
C	you have to you have to microwave at the bottom of the microwave cos then you get the warm sponge and the hot inside
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	hot liquid inside
B	it is great for warming things
C	now there's other thing that a a you know a posh chef would not dream of cooking in a microwave
A	that's right that's right
B	mm
A	I used to do
B	that's all they did really
A	tubs and that's all they did
C	it wasn't cooked
B	no
A	it wasn't cooked they'd bought it all in loads of that cooked
C	oh it was cooked
B	oh it was cooked
A	yes it was cooked
B	partially cooked yeah
A	partially cooked and all they had to do was heat it up in the microwave
B	mm
C	mm
B	just put it on the plates
A	and they had boxes and boxes of these all the vegetables you can imagine cos when when people are four people order dinner they order their dinner they all want their dinner at once
C	mm yeah
A	you'll see all the
C	mm I agree yeah yeah
B	mm
A	what are you up to
C	she's tidying up
B	just clearing it up
B	yeah well it's going to go straight in the recycle bin now you don't have to wash it
C	well I think washing actually wastes the total value of recycling
B	it does
C	the amount of water people do do you know lots of people put their cans to recycle in the dishwasher before they put them in the recycling
B	do they?
A	oh right
C	yeah
B	in the dishwasher we we'd always
C	they wash em
B	we always scraped ours out
A	well
C	we just put them in dirty
A	yeah
B	not with baked beans or anything you couldn't
C	what? baked beans can yeah? just goes in
B	I know it goes yeah
C	yeah if by the time I washed it any any value
A	but this is
C	has to have been lost by the water I've wasted
A	this is where we're different you see we we save every drop of water we can don't we? if we have any leftover see that little gel up there
C	yeah
A	that'll go in there
C	good on you
A	and then we rinse everything out with a
B	that's why you rinse with
A	with the with the gel with water
B	we hardly ever use the tap to rinse them
A	hardly ever use the tap
B	so we do save
C	mm
B	it is saved water really
A	use all all the water and if this washing up water left in looks fairly decent we leave the water in so that we can just rinse out whatever
B	and if we're washing up we always fill up a kettle or something first with all the water
A	mm
B	and and that goes on the fire
A	with that kettle in there
B	actually use that all the time
B	so we use that one first then fill up again from the hot tap before we get
C	oh you get and then put it back in the flask
A	yeah
B	saves a bit
C	mind you that still costs
B	it's only one litre
C	mm?
[ANNOTATION]	the kettle is filled from the cold tap	Contradiction
B	only one water litre
A	one litre no do you use as much as you like do you
C	yeah I do
B	mm we are extremely careful with our water
A	because
B	I think everyone should be around here
C	and how much do you pay then?
A	thirty-six pound a
B	a quarter
C	is that all?
B	yeah
C	but then you oh and you've got no sewage have you?
A	no sewage no
C	and no
[ANNOTATION]	B is very careful about not wasting water	Entailment
A	no rainwater no
C	where's that go then?
A	what? the rain water?
[ANNOTATION]	the kettle is nearly broken as it has been bought for cheap	Neutral
C	yeah
A	into the taps
C	mm?
A	into our taps
C	off the house though?
A	off the house down into our our internal
A	filtering
C	oh yeah so you don't have to pay for that
A	you shouldn't you should have got
C	oh we don't have any we pay a thousand or something a year water and sewage
B	oh
A	yeah yeah
C	something like that
A	oh yeah when we want our sewage empty
C	I think it's more than a thousand actually
[ANNOTATION]	A's sewage is full right now and needs to be emptied	Neutral
A	that that cost round about a hundred pound to empty the sewage
C	oh well there we go but
[ANNOTATION]	it costs more than 50 pounds to empty the sewage	Entailment
A	no
C	it's meant to be a it's not a septic tank it's a digester
B	yeah
B	but it does need emptying sometimes
A	but it does need emptying every now and then you see the trouble is we're we're on clay land so
C	once the clay is wet it won't
A	once the clay is wet that won't silt on it
[ANNOTATION]	sewage doesn't need to be emptied since the water is absorbed with time	Contradiction
C	no
A	but I'm not comparing
C	I know yeah yeah you you fertiliser the field next door
A	yeah yeah
B	that's only water really isn't it?
C	no it's not it's raw sewage
A	no it's not it's just water raw sewage there'd be lumps of everything
B	nice conversation at lunchtime
C	yeah
A	that are we doing now
C	you're taking that lather part
A	ooh yeah
B	mm yeah
A	yeah
C	well do you want more to eat?
A	no no I've finished
C	that goes back into there doesn't it?
A	yes that goes in the bag
B	ooh you've washed up
C	leave it in the bag I only have one slice you see I I eat too much here
B	one slice
A	you eat too much here
C	yeah yeah it's not a complaint
C	oh I see you meant to have three
A	god look
C	the hard cheese that went wrong pudding
A	well it didn't go wrong did it? you just put too much er too much er too much digestive on it didn't you? your pudding didn't go wrong
C	mm?
A	your pudding didn't go wrong
C	oh the pudding itself didn't the cheese did though
C	that's going in
B	why do you say the cheese went wrong?
C	well I don't know where that goes now
A	cos it soaked into the
C	where does your recycling go?
B	erm in
A	in the tub
C	in the tub
B	in the under the stairs
A	in the tub under the stairs
C	oh I thought that was the bin
B	no the box one
C	oh right
A	that one that
C	oh right I think he does
A	I think he does yeah
C	ah now now peanut butter probably goes in there doesn't it?
A	yes
B	yeah

A	no no
C	no it goes in the drawer
A	yes
C	forgotten where it is
B	bet no one else has got a red drawer have they?
C	mm?
B	I'll bet no one else has got a red drawer like that?
C	no they haven't no right so we're playing with that chuck are we doing that chuck out there or in here
A	well we'll do it in here if you like
C	we might as well mightn't we?
A	yeah
