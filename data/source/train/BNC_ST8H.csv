A	you used to do bubble writing yonks ago
D	yes
B	yeah that was good wasn't it?
D	yes
B	mm
D	so it goes longer quite easy
B	oh right
D	and quite fast
A	mm

D	and then
B	who's was that stuck the
D	oh yeah that's the teacher's writing saying how I could get it done
B	oh
D	and then that was my my map for my er new er idea cos you had to go and look into structures even more
B	right
A	oh right
B	oh that's good
A	that's nice I like that yeah
B	mm
D	and
B	oh dancers
D	because we did a proposal which I haven't stuck in yet erm

B	right
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	then you had to do your own pictures

D	er there's some experiments
B	mm
A	he
B	oh
D	and erm
B	mm
D	we did the process of it
A	oh right
D	and then that was actually my piece and it's really big and it's at school
C	it's a massive piece isn't it?
D	yeah
C	it's probably about as long as this table
A	is it?
D	mm
B	yeah?
A	well
D	so
B	mm
D	and then I had another artists for a different piece cos miss wanted to look at colour she said pick out colour and movement and stuff

A	yeah
D	so there's like five etching plates
B	right
D	work
B	mm yeah
A	they're very good
B	mm they are aren't they?
A	I like them
D	and then
B	wow
D	I looked at the different
B	mm
D	colours and how they well and then I do have process pictures which are actually here which
B	what are they?
D	they're process pictures cos you have to put pictures with your process so you etch them
A	oh I see
A	yeah yeah
D	and then
B	mm
D	I have
B	mm
D	and then they also had all the etching plates I stuck them all together so I
A	oh right
B	oh
D	I stuck them all together they broke in my bag when I was going to school not like the etching plates broke they just came apart so I was fixing them
A	oh what?
D	so then
B	what are they made of?
D	they're the they're the etching plates they didn't like split as the plates broke I mean the
C	she put some spaces between the
D	I did the
C	five plates to make it like a model
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	I had three of them
B	right
D	so you could see through it
B	mm
D	but yeah and erm
A	oh no
D	so then
B	oh
D	and then miss looked at them and she was like mm I love the etching plates more than the etchings and I was like yes saying that's why I put them together she's like
A	oh okay
D	okay
B	right
D	so
B	okay
D	I left them at school they need to mark them
C	if you bring them if you find out how thick the plates are I'll make you I'll laser cut you something so you can stand them up in it
B	mm
D	okay
C	and then you can
D	and I can slip them in
C	you can slip them in
D	yeah
A	well that would be good won't it?
D	yeah
C	and then you could put a light underneath the bottom
D	yeah
C	and it would come through the acrylic plate and it
D	mm
C	might just make it look a little bit different
D	yeah okay I'll bring them home tomorrow
C	cos this
B	they're acrylic?
C	yeah it's
B	is that easier to scratch then?
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	it is?
D	mm
B	oh
C	it's what we used to use when I did
B	right
C	and then
B	I've only done the metal one you see
C	you just
B	oh
C	scratch it and then you just rub the ink in
A	yeah
C	and then
D	yeah
C	put it through the press
B	mm
D	yeah so
B	mm
A	oh they're great
D	but the printing out room is not working and the one in the library wouldn't let me print off print it off so I was like
A	oh right
D	so that's how it turned out in the art room so I did show them and I was like I need to print them off but your printer's not working so miss was like oh yeah we'll get that working I was thinking
B	yeah
C	as long as you've got evidence to show that you've printed them off
D	yeah I printed them twice as well
B	yeah
C	then it's
D	because I printed them here as well
B	cos you're gonna get two things out of it
D	pardon?
B	you're gonna end up with two things out of the
D	yeah and that's what miss liked she was like I like how you used it
B	mm
C	but my printer's gone funny so
A	your printer's gone funny?
C	yeah
A	what's the matter with your printer?
C	it's just not printing properly
D	it's printing like this
A	has it got run run out of ink or something?
C	no
A	what is it HP?
C	it's an Epson one
B	oh I see
A	oh right
D	it's printing like that
A	oh I see yeah
B	yeah
D	so I did have to prove twice
B	mm
D	that I tried to print them off
D	so
B	our printer it
A	yeah and it's still printing
B	it wouldn't print something so we
A	yeah so we got the inks and it
B	and
A	started printing again
B	yeah
C	yeah right
B	we haven't put them in yet
A	no
C	I mean I it shows you how much on this one I can know how much ink I've got left and I haven't got much ink left now in them
D	mm
B	I'll do that
D	okay
B	very good that's a lot of work too
D	yeah it's really heavy
A	yeah
C	and I can buy another I can
A	yes cos
C	to replace it so I might as well buy another printer
A	yeah
C	but now it's gonna
A	work
C	work with a warranty
A	yeah
C	do that but er
A	cos the HP have now got a plan haven't they? for your inks you you can pay so much per month and have as much ink as you like
C	yeah
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	I think it's eleven pound a month
B	what do they keep sending them to you or?
A	well when you run out you get another one
C	yeah yeah so you
B	oh right
C	yeah
B	mm
C	so I don't know I might look
B	sounds a bit strange really
A	well you've got to
B	well they'll know they'll know that you you've run out of it
A	you've got to you've gotta use it a lot
C	I might look at the Canon ones
A	yeah they look good don't they yeah
C	I might look at the Canon ones so
A	yeah we thought about getting an A3 didn't we? and then we thought
B	a long time ago
C	mm
A	it was a long time ago
B	yeah
A	we thought oh
B	we thought how many A3s so we really want to print out?
A	and you've got to buy the paper haven't you as well
B	yeah
C	so that's what I need to do but I I've got to get some tyres for my car first so
A	you ain't got them yet?
C	no not yet
A	oh

B	us girls
A	but you don't count it at all
B	mm
B	oh dear
A	anyway
C	you know they're thinking about taking the three point turn out of the
A	are they?
C	they're thinking about taking the three-point turn out of the driving test
A	well cos too many people are
B	why?
A	too many women are taking it
C	why?
B	they're taking it out?
C	they're thinking about taking the three-point turn out
D	what's the three-point?
B	that's really important
C	where you have where you have to turn in the road without touching the curb
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	which turn the car round in three points
A	oh
D	yeah but satnavs are like everyone gets annoyed at them cos they tell you go through buildings and you can't there's a building
A	they do
C	no
E	you are not on a road
C	not not the new ones not the most up-to-date ones
E	oh
C	the most updated ones are are pretty good but you've still gotta read you've still gotta read the road signs
B	mm
A	you have yeah
C	because they because they change things unless you keep your satnav up-to-date
B	yeah still got to read the road signs anyway
C	you know
B	haven't you?
C	you know I made that mistake when I went to
C	my satnav was up to date in at Easter time
A	mm oh yeah
C	satnav was telling me I can't go that way but because I knew where I'd I'd always done that I'd always been that way
A	you wouldn't have been fined
C	I wouldn't have been fined
E	ah
B	mm
C	going in the a bus lane
B	yeah
A	well we we went on a followed the satnav and that said turn here turn there and we're going down this little track and you get down to the bottom and it said if you were following your satnav please turn round
B	you've come the wrong way
A	you've come the wrong way this is
B	mm
A	yeah and it didn't tell you until you nearly got up down to the bottom did it? so we had to turn round
B	huge sign
A	yeah a massive sign
C	yeah you
A	but as you say they're all been updated now haven't they?
C	you've gotta you've gotta read your little
B	but are they are they saying though the three-point turn that that you shouldn't turn in the middle of the road any more?
C	no that what
B	you should go back to a road or something?
C	no no what they're saying is they don't think it's appropriate any more to do a three-point turn
B	oh
C	and some organisations are saying it is because if you were in a cul-de-sac
A	yeah
C	you need to be able to get out
B	yeah that's right you do
A	yeah you do
B	yeah
C	if you're in a car park
B	they don't always provide
C	you need to get be able to get out of a car park
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	because if you're reversing in a car park you reverse out
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	you can't always do that in the way that you went in
A	no you can't no
B	no
C	you've gotta come out a little bit
B	that's quite a skill actually isn't it?
