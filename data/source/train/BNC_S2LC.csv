A	cos I like English language but I feel like I might be able to do English language
B	mm
A	I don't I feel like maybe I don't need a teacher for it I could probably
B	oh look there's where I work
A	oh mm
B	well not in there but
A	I could probably just read the books
B	yeah
A	and I mean you know like that that's kind of like the same with creative writing but like I
B	yeah
A	but like French I couldn't really carry on that by myself because I'm not a good enough standard
B	mm
A	so like it's my extra subjects I should probably pick something
B	yeah
A	cos there's lots of books on English language and I feel like if I read those I'd be alright doing it myself
B	yeah it would be good to
[ANNOTATION]	reading books is not enough	Contradiction
A	and if I was studying it myself when I'm in the English department anyway and I had some kind of a question that I didn't understand something I'm sure there'd be someone there to help me
B	yeah
A	and they have like erm you can do like world literature
B	mm
A	erm Greek like I don't know what they do like
B	what from like classics?
A	yeah I think so maybe not quite classics cos they do have a separate classics course
B	oh I thought it would be er more modern world literature
A	no yeah it's like that old stuff
B	oh right
A	it kind of broadens your knowledge of like yeah I suppose like classical things it's not quite classics though because in classics
B	well going back to older like
[ANNOTATION]	the course is about modern literature	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	literature
A	yeah in different countries because in classics you
B	yeah
A	I would have quite liked to do maybe something like philosophy but I don't know what I'd do with philosophy and again that's something that I could do in my own time really
B	mm
A	cos I could just read I could read there's lots of books on philosophy that I could do
[ANNOTATION]	there are book resources in philosophy	Entailment
B	you could become a full time philosopher
A	yeah cos there's lots of work for full time philosophers
A	philosophising all day
B	is there a lot of work for English literature students?
A	of course there is
B	is there?
A	because you can go into anything
B	like what?
[ANNOTATION]	there are book on philosophy	Entailment
A	like
B	well philosophers in theory should be able to go into anything as well
A	well yeah if you do a philosophy degree
B	yeah
A	but you said you could become a full time
A	like there's no there's
B	well if you're good at it and old books then
[ANNOTATION]	English literature students read philosophy	Neutral
B	I mean there's been somebody on TV who's a
A	yeah there's like one or two in like
B	yeah
A	the world
B	yeah
A	I don't think students who go and do a philosophy degree are planning to go into being a full time philosopher
B	well how do philosophers come about then? they must start somewhere
A	yeah well may may I think
B	just cos we're in the modern world and we think we know everything doesn't mean
A	no but yeah there are loads of modern philosophers but the thing is those philosophers probably don't just philosophise all day so like yeah they'll have a book but they'll also do like I dunno research and they'll probably
B	well they probably teach don't they?
A	yeah they probably teach they
B	that would be good that that would be a good job
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but you wouldn't be I don't think it would be very rare for someone to be able to live on that full time
B	mm yeah they have to do other things wouldn't they?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	in terms of like employability even though like English
B	yeah
A	but I'm doing it cos I like English
B	well I suppose it demonstrates your level of intelligence if
A	yeah
B	you have a degree in most things doesn't it?
A	well philosophy is kind of quite useful to have like a bit of a knowledge for it cos sometimes I've read books and like I don't understand them because they're like philosophical novels
B	mm
A	and they've got like theories and things in them and I'm just I just don't understand them because I don't know anything about them like I read some Camus and I didn't I didn't realise that he was like I just read it and I was like wow this is a weird book
B	who?
A	Camus
B	I don't know is he a philosopher?
A	do you not? yeah well he writes like philosophical fiction
B	oh right
A	I don't know if he's got any actual like the pure philosophy things but yeah erm he's quite like
B	sounds quite interesting
A	existential
B	oh
A	read it in French though
B	mm
A	cos it was really short and it was just really strange like well the story wasn't that strange but I don't know and I I didn't really understand it and I feel like if I read it again and read it up a bit more about like some theories that he was trying to employ I think I'd understand it better
B	what was he was he coming up with some philosophical ideas which was the theory of some philosopher which is a recognised theory
A	no I think it's like because there are like different types of philosophers and I think
B	mm
A	and he's quite existential so within existentialism it's erm
B	so do you have to understand a bit about that philosophy to understand the book?
A	I think so yeah because I mean I kind of like even now knowing a bit more about cos I did I did some research and I do know a bit more about the different branches and things but it's I mean I have to reread the book cos I can't really remember it that well now but even with knowing that I think I'm still kind of thinking about thinking back to the book like not quite sure what he was doing I think I'd have to read it again
B	I've read er Voltaire
A	yeah
B	one of his novels
A	did you?
B	and he's like a philosophical writer
A	yeah
B	isn't he?
A	yeah
B	yeah but going way back
A	did you
B	to
A	understand it?
B	no
B	so I didn't
A	and like yeah no I read erm
B	but like I I mean that was done as I think that's kind of I think I would enjoy more er er reading philosophy in a
A	yeah
B	er knowing that it is just
A	in in its purest form yeah
B	yeah well they they're
A	yeah
B	telling you about their theories indirectly rather than in
A	yeah
B	written in
A	it's quite good that
B	you you have to
A	yeah I've read like extracts and things from certain books
B	yeah although you
A	and they're quite interesting
B	having said that it probably is like anything of that kind of
A	yeah cos a lot of them as well a lot of them are erm
B	yeah
A	all this debate and I'm just like because it there was a bit that I read and then like sometimes I see quotes and I'm like I need to see that in context so I see it in context and I'm like well I've not read the whole book I'll have a look what other people are saying and then there's these people on this like forum or whatever like debating like no well this person says this then this person says that
B	mm
A	yeah I think especially some of the some of the newer ones would be okay to read I think like you can get like philosophy for beginners or like you know
B	yeah something like that might be more
A	or like quite erm they they like present it in quite like a
B	simple
A	a casual way you know what I mean? like you know
B	yeah cos I think to read any of your
A	or Aristotle or something
B	yeah or even or modern ones or something
A	or Plato
B	could be quite like
A	yeah could be yeah
B	erm be better to read a book that kind of explains it to you rather than reading it directly
A	yeah
B	er what have you ever
A	I've never read like a yeah I'd quite like to I'd like
B	on philosophers or?
A	cos I've read like extracts and I've read all these were quite academic though the ones I was looking at either extracts and then I've read like a critic writing about it or like a discussion on like erm a forum but these forums tend to be like quite high like you know what I mean? they're not just kind of people like discussing
B	yeah
A	like they are they do know what they're talking about like discussions erm and I I'm quite I I
B	yeah
A	I feel like I'd need the book with kind of someone's like notes next to me like don't understand that that's actually a reference to like you know whatever and I'd be like oh okay
B	mm
A	I'm not that hungry
B	no not at all really er cos this there's services here there's something about twenty odd miles I think
A	oh we can go to those ones maybe
B	erm cos after that well there probably is some further down this is the
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	I'm just trying to think
A	Tiverton service area
B	Tiverton
A	junction twenty-seven
B	and that's two hundred and thirty-one miles is it? is there a timing on that to the left?
A	ten eighteen
B	oh I think it's just timing in each section
A	yeah
B	so not an overall time there? er
A	no
B	each section
A	no I think you asked me this last time and there wasn't
B	oh cos I've not printed out the whole thing so that's about two hundred miles that we've probably done
A	that's like a bit further down the page there's Exeter so if you
B	well that's that's coming too
A	er Exeter is two hundred and forty-seven miles
B	yeah see that
A	and Tiverton is two hundred and thirty-one
B	yeah no we don't
A	so Tiverton must be near Exeter
B	yeah we don't wanna wait till that far down but it might be a bit soon yet I'm just trying to think cos I suppose we should have a little break some time but erm
A	we could always buy like sandwiches and then eat them later
B	yeah well we've probably travelled
A	yeah
B	and then we've got probably half of the journey after that it's just sort of to break it up a bit it's probably a bit too early to stop
A	yeah
B	erm whether we're hungry or not we'll see what you fancy at the time I suppose we should so say
A	yeah
B	er before before half three
A	uhu
B	and then we if we have dinner about eight or something that that's alright isn't it? it's not too late
A	yeah
B	it's it's a nice break a long break between it's not getting too late in the day to be eating at that time is it?
A	yeah
B	cos we we won't be eating six'll be too early we wouldn't wanna eat at that time
A	yeah probably not
B	check in you want to spray the whole place down with the
A	disinfectant
B	antibacterial thing or I think I'd better do that
B	unless I'm going out for a walk while you do it have you brought a special mask this time?
B	so we're the other side of Birmingham now
A	oh
B	the next next town we're gonna come to is Worcester
A	oh Worcestershire
B	yeah
A	or is it Worcester sauce? Worcester sauce isn't it? not Worcestershire sauce or is it Worcestershire?
B	I think it's Worcestershire
A	oh
B	you can
A	whatever yeah
B	Worcester sauce it think Worcestershire no I think it's Worcestershire
A	yeah
B	yeah I'll wait till I'm a little bit more tired I'm still not too bad driving on
A	what it's weird how Worcester is spelt isn't it? it's like
B	yeah
A	cester
B	yeah there's few place names like that
A	a few yeah a few counties like
B	yeah Leicester is really yeah where you don't pronounce it
A	yeah
B	as it's spelt
A	oh
B	but people who are from that area call it Leominster
A	oh
A	yeah
B	M I N S T E R and they say Leominster
A	oh
B	they miss out the O completely
A	yeah
B	well there's one just on the way just outside of
A	yeah
B	which you think it would they say
A	is it
B	yeah
B	they say
B	oh right so that's what it's called
A	it just seemed I don't know it just seemed like it would
B	yeah you always seem to miss out one kind of extreme
A	yeah
B	letter don't you in these words?
A	it's probably come from Latin
B	Leominster?
A	yeah
B	yeah they probably
A	a Gaelic kind of thing
B	go back to a long long time ago don't they?
A	but er English has erm all these silent Bs all over the place like silent letters
B	oh right
A	because of Latin because they had them
B	oh
A	so when people were like yeah we'll just put them in because Latin has them
B	oh right
A	and then you know erm also erm the reason why we have a H after G in some words like ghost
B	yeah
A	is because erm
B	oh they just decided
A	yeah
B	okay oh
A	because because
B	somebody went through the
A	no it it was
A	yeah it was the erm
B	because in English they used
A	the Flemish
B	be a lot more simple didn't they?
A	it was the
B	what was it?
A	the the there was a lot of Flemish people in the erm
B	oh right
A	printing whatever
B	oh it as the printing the wasn't it? yeah
A	yeah so they all put it in
B	yeah
A	but it's not been retained in everything
B	yeah
A	just in some words so like English is like oh yeah
B	yeah
A	cos Flemish has erm
B	that's right I know I heard something like that
A	yeah
B	cos er English it used to be a lot more see it is has you see it wasn't it?
A	well they they
A	didn't have standardised spelling or anything
B	no
A	so people just used to spell everything however they wanted to
B	yeah
A	and spelling only became standardised in seventeen fifty-five with the introduction of Johnson's dictionary
B	really?
A	which took him about eleven years or something to
B	oh
A	write
B	I know Johnson's dictionary I didn't know he was the one to standardise it
A	well he was the first dictionary
B	mm
A	so that's only when
B	yeah
A	but then
B	yeah and they thought oh why do we have to go with that?
A	and there wasn't and you know like local people who like
B	yeah
A	not a lot of education and like things like that so it did take a while for it to become like standard but the introduction of that was kind of like the beginning
B	yeah
A	of this is how you spell things
B	well it will do like from that kind of time yeah be a lot of differences so I guess that's as it is when you're when you're kind of alive during times you don't realise how language is developing but you know when you look at it down the ages you see you know so that was his dictionary yeah but language will change all the time
A	yeah
B	won't it?
A	well I mean he made a I think he made more dictionaries over the years well like the Oxford dictionary adds a new word
B	yeah
A	when it's been in use for ten years
B	mm yeah so you get like things that were considered slang and will be entered into it at some point won't they?
A	yeah
B	if it's still the common use
A	I really like etymology dot com and you can put in a word and you can find out its etymology
B	what does that mean? its history?
A	origins it's good it's a fun website
B	I don't think many people would say that but obviously has to who's interested in words and English would only say it's a fun website
A	dictionary dot com is good as well dictionary dot com is really good because it's not just a dictionary it gives you like all sorts of fun facts about language and words and like they have new articles and things coming up about words and stuff it's good
B	so do you sit in your room all night putting stuff into that saying oh look at that I didn't know that
A	and like I
B	do you?
A	yeah it's good
B	well I suppose you're putting your free time to better use than just sitting down and watching telly
A	I know yeah
B	or playing
A	it's good entertainment dictionary dot com is
B	why do they get somebody on singing and dancing on words
B	oh right
A	it's harder than it sounds
B	it sounds very hard to me
B	did you win?
A	yeah I was like first in the world
B	were you?
A	but probably nobody was playing like
B	oh somebody's took your crown now you'd better go back on
A	probably yeah I was like first in the world for like that month or
B	yeah but can you cheat and look it up?
A	well it's it's timed
B	I don't think you can can you? oh right
A	well yeah and how would you look it like you put the definition in like
B	yeah well you could google that definition and it would come up wouldn't it?
A	yeah maybe
B	oh right
A	and it's like I could have fit a good word in there but I just don't have the letters it's just annoying
B	who you who do you play Scrabble with?
A	online
B	oh
A	it was good I did play quite a bit of Scrabble for like a while but then I just got bored
B	who do you play against online? just a computer?
A	erm
B	or with other people like?
A	no they just pair you with someone round the world
B	really?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think it was through Facebook or something
B	mm
A	and you like put in a user name and then you just like you can play with someone
B	yeah
A	no
B	you just play?
A	I think you can like able chat if you want but
B	do what?
A	I think you can click like if you want to chat with people but you can just have an option to just play
B	yeah but er is it is it all in English though?
A	yeah
B	well how do you know it's a real word? is that checked by?
A	because the
B	oh right
A	yeah I was I was properly against people cheating as well
B	well there's not much point really is there playing if you're going to cheat against some random stranger?
B	it's not really what's the point in playing?
B	I beat that person if you just well I don't understand the satisfaction
A	yeah well they want to go up on the leader board
B	mm
A	I think cos like on the Facebook thing you can like invite your friend to play with you or you can just be paired with like a random person who also wants to play
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	oh right
A	no
B	mm
A	it I saw it in our college library and I was like oh what's this? so I went to have a look and it's basically a dictionary but it it tells you the pronunciation in erm English English and American English
B	oh right I thought all dictionaries do they not have a thing where it shows you how to pronounce stuff?
A	yeah it will yeah if you get a good dictionary then it does
B	mm
A	but this was just I don't know why they why that's what I was thinking you can you can get it in a normal dictionary as well
B	not American though it
A	yeah
B	I wonder why they have that combination
A	well because they're both English aren't they?
B	oh right
B	yeah but the two
A	they're the two types of English you can get
B	yeah but I suppose if you're if they if it's published in English in America I suppose but if it's just published over here you're not gonna need the American one are you?
A	no but you might want to for like purposes of having a look like get the change
A	no but if you're a linguist then you
B	if you're a linguist you should know already shouldn't you?
A	well not necessarily
B	you know you're not gonna need American
A	no
B	pronunciation are you?
A	I might like to look at it for the novelty though
B	unless when you go over there on holiday you start talking American to everyone
A	it's quite good for the novelty of it although dictionary dot com provides me with both as well
B	does it?
A	yeah so I don't need to learn the phonetic alphabet but I want to
B	is it something you use?
A	I think I would I'd use it when I'm when I'm doing my dictionary surfing and if I saw a word I could know how to pronounce it as well
B	dictionary surfing?
B	what's that?
B	do you have to go to the seaside for it?
A	I just made that up then like people surf the the internet don't they? I can surf the dictionary
B	yeah
B	I mean I wonder where that's come from it's a bit odd really isn't it?
A	yeah
B	pardon?
A	it's idiomatic
B	what are you calling the person an idiot who thought of it?
B	yeah
A	and in French we learnt some of them but I've forgotten most of them
B	what in French?
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	it's erm it basically means that like oh I'm fed up or bored
B	yeah that is quite interesting other countries' use of expressions I mean that's just weird isn't it?
B	why would anyone have a cockroach on your head when you're bored?
A	or er it's raining cats and dogs
B	well yeah
A	in England
B	yeah they're all strange aren't they?
B	mm
A	that makes sense but what what we would say like
B	I'm so hungry I could eat a horse
A	I could eat a horse yeah that's weird as well isn't it? why would you be eating a horse?
B	you'd think the French would say that though
A	yeah
B	they eat horses
A	yeah
B	we don't
B	we say it I guess cos it's quite a big animal isn't it a horse?
A	yeah
B	probably where it'll be coming from
A	I think the French one about the cockroaches
B	oh
A	and it it's like basically like I think where it comes from is like as though it's like oh I don't know it's so weird isn't it?
B	yeah
A	do you want some of these?
B	yeah if you're dishing some out no wonder we're not hungry
A	I know yeah
B	they are tasty
A	you can't taste them?
B	I said they're tasty
A	oh right
B	yeah I was riding my bike home in it
B	probably not safe to ride a bike in a thunderstorm really
A	no you could have been struck
B	does she scream?
A	no
B	so many people don't
B	some people do don't they?
A	she's like they're so dangerous
B	it's extremely rare
A	I know
B	more dangerous crossing a road
B	yeah you're supposed to turn off electrical appliances cos
A	yeah
B	cos
A	I don't think many people do though they?
B	no
A	I don't
B	cos it's quite a rare thing isn't it? it's like
A	I remember when we were at the country house and there was a like a big thunderstorm and they're I really like them over there because you actually get the forks of lightning and over here you only really get the sheet lightning
B	well you do you get fork lightning here it's just they're probably not as common
A	probably and it's probably behind the clouds
B	you can't see it yeah
A	yeah so I never really see the fork lightning over here and over there you do and I'm like looking it like wow and grandma's like got all the lights switched off and like all the electrical things off and everything and she's like
B	did she do that the other night?
A	no
B	oh did she not?
A	no but she she she did it in the country house I think maybe cos she's worried cos there's loads of trees there and a big forest
B	well yeah when you when it the sky is clear and it's lightning it's it can be spectacular and you do you people send photos that you get them showing them on the news of
A	yeah
B	er so you do see them the fork lightning it's just like you say it depends on clouds and where you are and
A	can they not er get electricity from storms?
B	erm
A	could they not?
B	it would be just so unpredictable wouldn't it?
A	yeah I know but
B	I guess you can
A	could they not sometimes?
B	but it's probably just not worth it is it?
A	yeah
B	what they would be able to get and store and the effort you'd put into something and what you'd get out of it
A	yeah
B	it's probably just not worth it is it? what are you thinking like of Frankenstein's monster when he
A	I mean
B	brought him to life with the lightning?
A	that would be good wouldn't it?
B	Ross-on-Wye it's not far from Hay-on-Wye
A	oh
B	people what?
A	aren't really doing like experiments anymore are they? well I mean if they
B	scientists are constantly doing experiments a lot of them are
B	experimenting for things like bringing a Frankenstein's monster
A	yeah no but he wasn't meant to be a monster though was he?
B	I think from that era when it's er like Victorian they did that have that kind of like idea or we'll
A	yeah
B	like and have that that idea of a mad scientist probably because they used to pick up bodies and things to
A	yeah
B	dissect them to understand your body
A	well I mean they still
B	I guess
A	like
B	well they use human bodies
A	yeah
B	just don't yeah
A	they just don't dig them up
B	just don't well yeah some
A	a legal way
B	well people donate their bodies don't they? science and
A	yeah well my my friend was like oh why don't you sign up for organ donation? and I was just like I don't really want to I don't I don't know I'm not
B	well in some countries it it's erm compulsory unless you sign out of it
A	oh
B	and they were thinking of doing that in this country because there are so few people doing it and it saves so many lives you know
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I don't know I feel like I want to but
B	so I've never signed up for it but I I'd be more than happy to give to donate any of my organs cos
A	yeah cos
A	it's good isn't it for like people?
B	well yeah if somebody's in need of a a
A	an organ
B	a liver or a heart or whatever if yours is good but I've erm I mean I think somebody once said oh don't do that cos maybe they won't try as hard to save your life or
A	they're like oh we can get all his organs oh
B	I dunno have you heard of like that I've I'm sure you've heard of like that exhibition you know where?
A	yeah that awful one
B	the
A	for yeah yeah if you say you donate your body to science then that could happen but if you've just donated your organs then they can't do that to you they can just take your organs
B	oh right
A	it
B	so they could use it for
A	yeah well I mean like supposedly
B	it's like a
A	it's a kind of
B	well yeah
A	educating the public but
B	not when he's posing and
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	playing tennis and cards that's doesn't stand up does it you know people just go out of morbid curiosity
A	oh I couldn't have looked at it like I'm so squeamish like oh
B	yeah
A	but if you just donate your organs I think all they can have is your organs
B	yeah
A	but it it yeah
B	they need to practise don't they?
A	yeah
B	the students on
A	like
B	they want
A	I'd rather them be practising on a dead body than like
B	yeah
A	but that must be awful like I don't know how doctors do that like oh oh
B	well everyone's different aren't they?
A	I couldn't even dissect a frog or
B	yeah it always seems to be girls that er
A	no there was a boy in my
B	yeah but they have that reputation of being more squeamish than boys
A	there was a boy in my science class who was like green in the face when we did the heart dissection I mean I just didn't look but he was like looking and it looked like he was about to faint
A	I think so yeah
B	yeah I don't see why not
A	I I was like so surprised I was like
B	it's not as though the whole body was there though
B	it's a bit probably harder to look at when the whole thing is
A	then again
B	is like
A	I'm the person who doesn't like touching raw meat so
B	well would you not be able to prepare it if you had gloves on or something?
A	no like even looking at it oh
B	shall we stop at the next services?
A	yeah
B	thirteen miles
A	yeah it stinks I hate the smell of raw meat
B	maybe it's gone off when you're you're
A	I don't think so
B	why when was the last time you were there? I don't think you go
A	well
B	that often do you? I mean obviously you've got the supermarket
A	no but even if you walk past even if you walk past no or like the deli counter
B	yeah I think there was something on the news a while ago saying oh there was a butcher and he was told by the
A	yeah

B	I think I overcooked it it wasn't nice when I had it
A	it's rose in popularity in like the western world
B	yeah it's meant to be
A	recently
B	good for you isn't it?
A	because it's supposed to be good for you
B	yeah
A	and everyone's been buying like you know all the health food
B	yeah
A	people are like oh it's really good and everything but the only problem is that in south America where they grow it
B	yeah
A	all the farmers that's like basically what their diet is made of
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a loves vegetables	Neutral
A	and because the demand has rose so high erm the prices are rising and everything and like the normal people there can't afford to eat it anymore
B	oh right
A	so like people are being encouraged to like not you know
B	not eat it
A	yeah because we're all buying it we could be eating anything and we're all
B	yeah
A	buying this now and the people over there who have literally like nothing er that's like what they eat
B	yeah
A	all the time that's like their rice
B	yeah
A	and
B	well can't they grow something else?
[ANNOTATION]	one of the products they refer to is avocado	Neutral
A	well maybe but
B	well maybe they're getting more wealth out of it if if it's such demand and
A	yeah but like the
B	charging us higher prices for it
A	but the the they're like the poor people
B	well no it probably doesn't go to those people yeah
A	yeah like the
B	mm
A	got nothing to eat
[ANNOTATION]	benefits probably don't go to the poor people who cultivate the food	Entailment
B	quinoa
A	yeah
B	yeah Q I N or whatever else
A	yeah
B	is in it
A	cos I saw I saw I see all these weird and wonderful things in Holland and Barrett's
B	mm
A	and I've seen people writing about it online and I saw this article and it's like yeah er I mean like obviously they do eat other stuff as well but like they're really like that that's where it grows for them really well
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has read articles about the topic	Entailment
A	and that's just what they eat and then
B	well it's like in
A	yeah
B	our kind of food
A	in that other place like we would grow potatoes
B	it's potatoes
A	yeah
B	and if people around the world started saying we want potatoes
[ANNOTATION]	these poor people cannot afford their food anymore because of its high demand	Entailment
B	farmers would sell it to the highest bidder
A	yeah
B	and er we'd just have to start paying higher prices although we we have so much variety here
A	yeah
B	we can eat anything
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a loves potatoes	Neutral
A	well yeah but over there like it it must be coming from like poor places and
B	yeah
A	they're like well
B	yeah it's probably their staple diet isn't it?
A	yeah and then
B	well yeah over the last couple of years I've heard a lot of like the
A	because it's a lot of people
B	publicity about it and you know
A	a lot of people who are eating it are like maybe like vegan or you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	erm and they're like all for like animal rights and everything and it's like well it's hurting somebody out there so maybe you should er
B	mm maybe you're gonna start eating that now are you?
A	no I well I I saw it at the shop I was and erm now that I know that I'm definitely not going to eat it
B	yeah I tried it once and I can't remember why it's meant to be good for you but
A	might as well have rice or something
B	I think I overcooked it I was gonna put it in salad and it kind of split and just it was kind of mushy I don't think it's meant to be like that so I think I I didn't do it again
A	oh
B	and
A	did you win?
B	no there's about two thousand people racing
A	yeah and there's all them professionals isn't there?

A	yeah
B	but we're still in a similar kind of position
A	oh
B	in a way er
B	yeah well no I'm never gonna win but
B	but I was the I was the fastest in our team
A	oh
B	so that's good
A	yeah
B	that I was like the fastest in the team
B	that's always the challenge and we got a personal trainer on our team
A	oh
B	and he's pretty fit
A	really?
B	yeah well he doesn't only do cycling so he you know
A	yeah
B	but he does other stuff you know
A	oh
B	and then erm he said oh I'm not he cos we said oh you can use one of ours and he said no that's it I've had it now just erm me and
B	before the next ride and then the other rider this personal trainer came back in cos he went out after
A	yeah
B	and he said oh I've just crashed and I'm I've had enough I'm not going out again
B	so there was just should be four of us and this was like in the middle of the night as well
B	just me and
A	yeah
B	but I think we would have done
B	well the hills you're going down
A	oh right
B	and when I went out a little bit of rain and it was like a grassy hill which you can go really quick on
A	yeah
B	so I went really quick and got past this rider and then unfortunately though just out of sight at the bottom of the hill
A	yeah
B	it comes to a bit of a turning
A	yeah
B	so cos you're going so quick you've got to brake then and er take it so you slow down and take the turning but cos there was a bit of rain er that wheel just slid like on the grass and cos I come off he had to brake behind me and then he went and slammed into me
B	I feel like we've done more than thirteen miles
