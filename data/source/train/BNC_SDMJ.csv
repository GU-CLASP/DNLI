A	it usually it's only professors who do
B	yes
B	so you're not doing your
A	mm
A	more work
A	in Finland you have to do
B	what do you mean?
A	we've we've just appointed a new professor at
B	yeah
A	with with that kind of
B	yeah
A	you can barely get a normal
A	yeah
B	and
A	in Britain you have to have I think at least five books
B	oh right
A	it's usually a mix
B	yeah
A	a book
B	journals
A	of of three or five articles or something like that
B	yeah
A	plus
B	yeah
A	cos I want to actually do research
A	so
B	I hate admin
A	yeah
B	bloody boring
A	yeah
B	which? the admin?
A	admin
B	oh yeah
A	tell me about the last five years I'm sure you've got a lot to tell
B	oh gosh what's happened in the last five years? so where are we two thousand and fifteen?
A	anything you
B	what within my job you mean?
B	well
A	mm
B	diabetes and stuff
A	mm
B	so that's become more of of a a thing in the last five years
A	mm
B	erm
A	is that because?
B	I'm just trying to think
A	is that because of more obesity or?
B	well that yeah
A	mm
A	what's that?
B	fatty liver I mean
A	too much beer?
B	well no
B	but it can be obesity
A	mm
B	so non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
A	mm
B	but
A	that sounds scary
B	yeah
A	mm
B	cos the CCG's no more now
A	mm
B	there's not gonna be any more erm
A	mm
B	but it's with all
A	mm
B	the governments I mean
A	mm
B	changing and everything
A	mm mm
B	like an NHS federation
A	mm
B	which is just really like an old health authority
B	erm
A	mm
B	obesity preventing this
A	mm
B	preventing
A	yeah
B	blah di blah
B	but I think yeah I think the admin has got
A	mm
B	a bit worse actually erm
A	mm
B	applications so that'll be a lot better for freshers
A	mm
B	whether it'll work or not
A	mm
A	yeah
B	cos we have something like ten thousand
A	yeah
B	so they either
A	mm
B	mm
A	it's a bit like
B	yeah
A	so they come and then within the first couple of months they
B	yeah
A	mm
B	it a lot's changed but erm
A	mm
B	gone more nurse-led now so
A	mm
B	it's run by the nurses now not the doctors
A	mm
B	it's mostly run by us now
A	okay
B	so
A	so it's it stays in the profession
B	yeah
A	you probably like doctors even less now because you see so little of them
B	yeah
A	mm
B	probably cheaper than doctors aren't we I suppose?
A	yeah
B	you know we do a lot
A	mm
B	we can do like prescribing and stuff like that so
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and you want an appointment you get an appointment with a nurse
A	mm
B	so basically
A	mm
B	you can come in sit and wait
A	mm
B	so whereas like
A	mm
B	you'd have appointments for the doctors like you could just book
A	yeah
B	but now you come in and you you just sit and wait
A	mm
B	so that's the there's an impact really
A	mm
B	they're getting more
A	mm
B	dependent on you
A	yeah
B	cos you notice the students coming in
A	mm
B	so you create like
A	mm
B	they can just come in whenever they want
B	you know?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	oh are you?
A	which is which is really
B	oh right
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	B I'm not
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm
A	and it just seems to be a lot of doctors and then of course a lot of interns
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	I thought I don't understand him and I'm not quite sure whether he understands me
B	but you'd be more be able to understand them than anyone wouldn't you?
A	mm mm
B	see that's another
A	mm
B	thing as well you don't get the continuity
A	mm
B	so you don't see your
A	no
B	do you know what I mean which is not a good thing either
A	no
B	mm
A	but he wasn't my doctor but there was a female doctor and she was the one who was my
B	mm
A	within the practice
B	yeah
A	and it was only if
B	yeah
A	that we would see her
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and anyone with a long-term condition has gotta have their own doctor
A	that makes sense
B	so they kind of can request to see them but then again
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	it doesn't really work
A	mm
B	say well
A	mm
B	I'll see you in two months they can book them in for two months do you know what I mean with them?
A	yeah
B	but that that's the the main thing that's happened
A	mm
B	and I mean
A	mm
B	god it's horrendous sometimes
A	yeah
B	flu
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	but I think
A	mm
B	like seven days a week don't they?
A	mm
B	for like seven days a week
A	are still ill seven days a week because
B	mm
A	there was always
B	yeah
A	that kind of service but you wouldn't have
B	yeah
A	I think it's it's just operations wasn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so say you were unwell
A	yeah
B	they would come out and see you at the weekend
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
B	cos we do quite a few late nights as well does your surgery do late nights?
A	mm
B	yeah
A	at least one where it's
B	yeah
A	later than usual
B	yeah
B	is it?
A	so
B	yeah
A	well but it's it's
B	yeah
A	I'm not ill enough
B	no
A	to know
B	but the thing is if you're working as well
A	mm
B	sometimes you can't get it in so
A	mm
B	it is good for people who work
A	yeah
B	but I just don't know how they're gonna
A	mm mm
B	there's no more funding for it at all
A	yeah
B	so I don't know whether I
A	mm
B	were gonna do it between them
A	mm mm
B	and the others kinda close
A	I think that's what they do on the
B	do
A	two or three walk-in centres
B	yeah
A	mm
A	mm
B	and the city centre that's all we've got here
A	yeah
B	down this end
A	cos
B	think
A	somewhere
B	the one in
A	okay
B	so that's only kids
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but
A	mm
B	you have to go with the flow and
A	stop
B	but
A	mm
B	or the day after do you know what I mean so they're quite good like
A	yeah
B	I'd just ask one of the
B	I'd just ask one of the docs in work
A	yeah
B	so what do you think about that?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's the kind of strain that catches you
B	you had it
A	yeah
B	but also them all coming in
A	mm
B	you know but I think you do build up an immunity don't you?
A	yeah
B	I know I do
A	mm
B	that's usually when I get my sore throat
A	yeah when everybody else is fine
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but usually
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I think that's the same with teaching
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah
A	or something there or you know but I I just fell ill I hadn't
B	yeah
A	been
B	yeah
A	just not interested
B	yeah cos then you're not yeah
A	just want to sleep I
B	yeah
A	ruined it for me
A	it's
B	but you see the planes as well I don't think they're very healthy are they?
A	mm
B	all the planes
A	and every single seat was taken
B	oh right
A	so
B	Finnair
B	are they alright Finnair? are they like Ryanair?
A	well they they have become like Ryanair
B	have they?
A	er it's it's because
B	yeah
A	you used to get food now you
B	oh
A	you might not
B	yeah
A	anyway and
B	how far is it
A	the prices haven't gone down and now you pay extra for luggage
B	oh
A	and they said
A	and
B	yeah
A	you just say this is the lowest
B	yeah
A	and
B	how far is it from Finland to
A	it's over three thousand miles
B	is it?
A	so we fly
B	yeah
A	hundred seater
B	yeah
A	and then take one
B	oh right
A	no
B	oh
A	regardless of where you're going so I've got a colleague
B	oh right
A	who's teaching French his family is in
B	yeah
A	so he has to fly to
B	oh god
A	yeah
B	yeah two flights
A	obviously getting to the airport and back
B	yeah
A	and he's
A	at uni
B	oh god
A	there's no
B	yeah
A	so again yeah you
B	is it dear is it dear in
A	everything is
B	expensive?
A	mm
B	so it's a bit like Sweden and?
A	yeah
B	oh do they?
A	anything that does
B	interesting
A	this is why they don't smile
A	ridiculously a Lidl is everywhere and you know well
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so twenty-four percent in Finland
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	god
A	ice cream is ridiculously expensive unless you get it in a supermarket that's but you know you you go out
B	mm
A	is three euros so you think
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	you shouldn't be paying two pounds thirty for a cone
B	yeah
A	it's cheap
B	oh it's cheap Germany now?
A	oh yeah
B	it's about the same as here is it?
A	food and beer of course it's probably even cheaper than here
B	is it?
A	mm
B	oh right
A	yeah
B	cos they said that food had gone down here but I couldn't see it to be honest
A	yeah that's
B	I couldn't see it
A	that's what I wondered they said that in Finland as well it's like well
B	no
A	it must be the kind of food that I didn't buy
B	I know but you know
B	do you know what I mean?
A	crumpets went up by five to ten pence every week
B	yeah and cereal went up
A	yeah
B	really high didn't it?
A	yeah and it was
B	cos our two they do they go through cereal like there's no tomorrow
A	yeah
B	and I notice god twenty P each week or
A	yeah
B	what was the other things that was going up? things like pasta and rice went up
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	which
B	and they were saying oh yeah it's gone down
A	yeah
B	no it hasn't
A	it hasn't it hasn't gone up even further than that
B	no
A	yeah
B	but be interesting to see what
A	mm
B	interesting thing he's gonna do tomorrow in this budget isn't it tomorrow?
A	yeah
B	load of rubbish
A	everybody will be cut down
B	mm
A	it's
B	imagine bringing up all them kids man
A	it's
B	can't do it
A	it's the only ambition that that I've heard
B	yeah
A	them having and it's like
A	it's
B	yeah it's not you don't wanna get into a deep conversation with them
A	yeah
B	I just got nothing in common with them
A	no it's
B	how can you wanna be?
A	mm
B	like that?
A	no
B	cos even I
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and she said they probably haven't even been to the city centre all they seem to do is
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	whatever
B	oh I don't oh no I don't know
A	what a life isn't it? they are behaving like kids and they're not much older because I can remember when he was a teenager
B	oh can you? where did he used to live? round here?
A	don't know but
B	was he?
A	but not a diamond and he
A	got in this
B	yeah
A	drunk he was in this fight and he can't have been older than say sixteen seventeen and I
B	was he?
A	I thought if that was then that's pretty
B	I think they look a lot older than what they are
A	he's got no teeth
B	he's got no teeth? oh do you know? oh god
A	yeah
B	but I bet you they're a lot older they're a lot younger than what we think they are
A	but I don't think they're very old
B	with their looks
A	no it's like
B	oh
A	but her mum doesn't live far
B	does she did mum live with the grandad?
A	don't know
A	but I know
B	oh he's alright
A	yeah
B	that's her grandad yeah
A	yeah so
B	well he's eighty-seven
A	yeah but
B	yeah
A	type
B	well the mother must be about fifty odd must she?
A	yeah
B	sixty maybe
A	yeah
A	it's
B	sometimes
A	mm
B	and
A	without shoes and then getting
B	put shoes on them I mean they could be walking in anything
A	yeah
B	but I remember
A	yeah
B	and he got a grip of the one down there and told him
A	mm
B	they weren't even bothered
A	mm
B	the children are are like down the
A	mm
B	she's right in the front
A	yeah
B	how can you watch a child like that?
A	I mean this is this
B	yeah
A	and they don't care
B	yeah
A	doesn't matter if they don't care they can't break quickly enough
B	but they wouldn't see her anyway she's only about that big
A	mm
B	they would not
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	no it's
B	yeah
A	so I think there
B	it is the jinxed house isn't it?
A	it's
B	oh yeah that was terrible that
A	this old
B	right
A	so it still didn't work because it just covered
B	the bit oh right
A	the credit she had
B	oh god
A	and she didn't last long
B	and where was the son? was he did he live in England or? cos she was like Indian wasn't she?
A	they didn't I think they only lived a couple of roads away
B	that was awful that
A	she could barely speak English so we we could
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh were they?
B	oh the baby again?
A	he no he no he was outside I think and he was shouting erm
A	lunchtime
B	yeah
B	and
A	well
B	yeah
A	I
B	what was he doing outside?
A	and he
B	was he out? was he out all night or something was he then maybe?
A	I don't know
A	rather than getting a second key
B	for god's sake
A	mm
B	but they will I you know what I just think they haven't got any common sense whatsoever
A	no
B	it's just they don't use their brain
A	this is just
B	I'm entitled to it
A	so you do
A	yeah
B	but you see
A	yeah
B	so if the mum and dad or the mum
A	mm
B	benefits they're gonna be on benefits aren't they?
A	yeah
B	it's terrible
A	yeah
B	I just feel sorry for them
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	the tough ones
B	yeah
A	and
B	is that is if
A	cos
B	if is that if they're quite bright the children? is that if they?
A	I don't
B	oh was that for everyone?
A	problems problem families
B	mm
A	yeah
B	oh right
A	educational
B	yeah
A	and then yeah basically you're getting some money because clearly nobody showed them
B	so parenting skills and stuff like that and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and who's
B	yeah
A	sort of taking a lot of stuff off your neck
B	but you see if they haven't got
A	no
B	yeah
A	you would have somebody who's like state appointed
B	yeah
A	which which must've worked because they
B	mm
A	it's yeah
A	if you
B	I mean this government and
A	yeah
A	well this is
B	oh I was made up with that
A	yeah
B	that's
A	I spoke to Ann Widdecombe
B	did you?
A	she was there and
B	oh was she there was she?
A	she she's little old lady I
B	yeah
A	old witch and
B	yeah
A	and then when I
B	mm
A	and she didn't even have a brolly
B	oh right?
A	and you're like former Minister of the Crown you know if we have anybody who's prominent on the Labour party side
B	yeah
A	they'll be in a group
B	yeah
A	she was there with her clipboard
A	horrible
B	that Esther McVey though ooh
A	yeah
B	oh I didn't like her at all
A	yeah I think Margaret Greenwood she is a GP isn't she?
B	is she the one who was who took her place?
A	yeah
B	oh is she?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Luciana Berger is big on that but
B	yeah
A	fire
B	oh yeah
A	cos they
B	yeah
B	and all of them have to go yeah
A	yeah
B	but also they they they're working as well till they're
A	mm
B	what
A	yeah
B	sixty-two or something?
A	just like they have to be fantastically fit
B	but how you gonna get
A	well you get the odd ones
B	but not on average are you?
A	no
A	plus of course it's it's the same it's it's like if you do Labour rather than
A	apparently his his one job was folding tablecloths that's the one job he's ever done
A	yeah
B	oh he's he's quite privileged then isn't he?
A	he's
B	they all are even
A	yeah
B	it it
A	he only he only has to make sure that thirty-five
A	he's a distant cousin of the queen
B	who David Cameron?
A	yeah
A	so he's thirty-sixth in line to the throne
B	so he's still got a claim to the throne even though he was
A	yeah
B	oh right?
A	so funnily enough that
B	mm
A	and the circles the queen is in
B	mm
B	I know
A	mm
B	I thought Labour would've got in but
A	yeah
B	that's where the problem is where they're voting where they don't vote
A	yeah but a lot more people have voted and of course
B	yeah
A	here in
B	yeah
A	yes we got the votes but in the wrong places so
B	you needed to take away the votes didn't you?
A	yeah
B	from like
A	yeah
B	Conservative and stuff
A	but
B	yeah
A	if you look at the total votes
B	yeah
A	erm
A	just in the wrong places
B	mm
A	so
B	who do you think
A	I've got no idea I've got
B	well you get a vote anyway don't you if you're a member of the Labour Party?
A	well I I I
B	oh did you?
A	because I thought it's a bit pointless so I've rejoined now
B	yeah
A	but
B	so why would they go into arts?
A	well it's
B	she wants it to go where does she want it to go?
A	because
B	into public spending?
A	in
B	no I don't agree with that at all do you?
A	obviously not so I mean Liz Kendall was never my favourite but you know she
B	it's
A	I think
B	yeah
A	but it wasn't like we
B	I know
A	it was just like well we do it broader rather than just
B	yeah
A	and they
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah
A	and you know it has worked because
A	the twenty twelve Olympics how well was it then?
B	yeah
A	so that worked but
B	erm
A	yeah he he is a Liverpudlian
B	yeah
A	who just has to happen to
B	yeah
A	but
B	oh did he?
A	yeah but
B	there was a few what were those few lads that were really good and then they didn't wanna go for the running what was it? one of them was in the army?
A	the the guy who
B	I liked
A	and then suddenly
B	but I liked him yeah he seemed quite erm
A	but he must've thought yeah I've seen what they've done to Ed Miliband do I want my family to be under that kind of pressure?
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	do I really want to? you know?
B	I mean they just took the mickey out of him in the end I think didn't they?
A	yeah
B	I just didn't like him though and I mean I'd never vote Conservative
A	mm
B	but I just didn't think he was strong enough
A	well that was that was that was the issue that everybody
B	and that's the reason
A	it's
B	yeah
A	and
A	and there were lots of people who thought oh yeah Labour just had it because of the Winter of Discontent blah blah blah
B	yeah
A	and then
B	yeah
A	last time in their lives
B	mm
A	I don't know
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The Winter of Discontent made Labour get it.	Entailment
B	yeah
B	mm
A	I just hope the budget will be an omnishambles
B	oh well well they're getting rid of the inheritance tax and we know who that's for don't we?
A	yeah I mean er
B	toffs
A	a million pounds worth
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The inheritance tax is still getting millions and millions of dollars, nowadays, and will continue to do so until they remove it.	Contradiction
A	and you know you think like yeah that works
B	I suppose they've worked for it
A	well I know somebody and their house is
B	yeah
A	you know in the south
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I think well do you know what they've worked for that house they've paid for it
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	A's partner does not give a damn about politics because it is too tiring.	Neutral
B	you know
A	mm
B	so why should it be taxed?
[ANNOTATION]	Period products should not be as highly taxed as they are nowadays.	Neutral
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I mean it's it's
B	yeah
A	it's not so much that okay we pass it on to the children it's the trouble is that
B	yeah
A	and what about the people who could not even save up to have a deposit?
[ANNOTATION]	The main issue is that this is passed onto the next generations.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	so you know it it just goes apart
B	yeah
A	and you think like well
B	yeah
A	you you can be intelligent about it because that's what
B	yeah
A	Paul McCartney did he said well
B	yeah
A	I'm not gonna give my
B	yeah
A	you know they they have set allowance and
B	yeah
A	eventually they will get a lot
B	yeah
A	but
B	eventually yeah but
A	well they've got the name anyway
B	yeah
A	they they're not gonna
B	and she's in her own right isn't she?
A	yeah
B	but erm
A	mm
B	he's gonna spend it all
A	super healthy living
B	oh yoga and all that palaver
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but you know for everybody else I think that's that's still just a tiny sliver of the population
B	yeah
A	you think like yeah you put a thousand pounds into the bank and by the time they go in to do university or finish school
B	yeah
A	that'll be
B	a nice little pot for when they go and get a car or whatever
A	yeah
B	no
A	and
B	mm
A	too socialist
B	yeah
A	mm
B	in Natwest or something
A	mm
B	so you could change that if you wanted to
A	yeah
B	they're all crap
A	I just moved
B	yeah
A	it wasn't much
B	yeah
A	it's like
B	yeah you need to look at that every year
A	mm
B	and I think sometimes you need to fix it
A	yeah
B	you
A	that's what I did
B	yeah
A	then it fell
B	yeah
A	year
B	yeah
A	one point four percent
B	it's better than erm er some of them they're some of them are rubbish
A	and
B	we used to get a lot each month
A	well
B	it's
A	and with
B	they want you to spend it?
A	well it's it's because the
B	yeah
A	which means you can't have high interest rates
B	yeah cos
A	if you have that the economy
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	I mean for me it was great I paid the house off because
B	yeah
A	every month it just
B	yeah
A	it
B	yeah
A	well
B	so how long have you been in that house now for?
A	well I moved in in two thousand two so it's thirteen years
B	oh did
A	so yeah because it was
B	two thousand two
A	as I said
B	yeah
A	and that's
B	yeah
A	when we last
B	so when
A	mm
B	is it seventeen years?
A	yeah
B	nineteen ninety
B	January
B	yeah
A	you know ideally that that my house is my office
B	it's a great little house isn't it?
A	and I just do consultancy work
B	yeah
B	but you never know what's gonna turn up here though in a couple of years
A	yeah
B	you might be alright mightn't you?
A	I just play the Lottery
B	yeah
A	mm mm mm
A	well I did teach at
A	cos I know well I know the people who work there and I know the kind of the jobs there is
B	it's not really?
A	no but you know it's
B	mm
A	and the lead investigator then just
B	didn't like it?
A	he fell out with the
B	yeah
