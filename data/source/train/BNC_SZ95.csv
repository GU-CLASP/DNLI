A	oh right
C	so like then I get the lowest amount
A	cos they're self employed
C	yeah
A	so like

C	yeah
A	and
C	yeah
A	so like last year

D	yeah
C	so I wouldn't
A	it's so unfair though that it goes on your parents cos I'm not being funny or anything but
D	mm
C	yeah
A	so if they didn't get paid that much money they wouldn't have
D	mm
C	yeah
A	if they don't get paid a lot and live to their means
C	so I know
A	so
D	yeah it is
A	yeah
D	uni and stuff like
C	yeah
D	it is bad
A	and it's not your parents who are gonna pay your loan back it's you
C	yeah I know
A	and when you're eighteen
C	shouldn't be about anything to do with your parents cos like
A	yeah
C	like this is her house so it's like
A	yeah
D	yeah you get more don't you? yeah yeah yeah
A	then I get the full whack
C	yeah
