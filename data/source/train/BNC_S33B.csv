B	yeah cos I still help out with the air cadets as a civilian instructor
A	oh okay
B	and I find that eh sometimes it's a little bit easier a little bit difficult to pick up what the youngsters are saying because they have a slightly different lingo
A	mm
B	for instance if they say something's cool I expect it to be a bit cold
A	and safe safe means good
B	oh does it?
A	yes
B	oh
A	right
A	it's positively boiling
A	and so what you also study German you said?
B	I do a German discussion group once a week
A	okay
B	to try to keep up the German that I learnt when I was travelling to Germany on business
A	ah
B	about thirty years ago thirty or forty years ago
A	and did you?
B	which is really work around the motor industry so vocabulary and the usage I learned was tended to be a bit on the technical side
A	mm hm
B	although now they say I've got quite a good vocabulary but I've found it rather difficult to string the words together
A	well German's quite a complicated language
B	well it is because of the different tenses
A	mm
B	but I mean for instance if you say the you could say the man bit the dog or the dog bit the man and it it wouldn't matter which way round you put the words
A	eh huh
B	because a German would still be able to pick up from the tense whether
A	ooh
B	it was the dog or the man that did the biting
A	of course cos it has all the different
B	of course you can't
A	cases
B	you can't have that in English
A	mm
B	em but eh they say that vocabularies are more important than than grammar
A	mm hm
B	not
A	yeah the most important thing is to communicate isn't it? I think
B	yes it is
A	vocabulary will help you do that more than grammar and how about Portuguese then?
B	well Portuguese I found very difficult
A	mm
B	I couldn't well I suppose I'm older now and memory doesn't stick quite so well
A	mm
B	but I found it extremely difficult and other people have told me that eh it's not an easy language to learn
A	mm
B	and so I didn't pursue it
A	oh no
B	em too many of them can speak English and they seem to sympathise with the problem and so I get on alright and a lot of the people I mix with over there are English people anyway
A	mm hm
B	so eh I get by
A	mm and it's quite similar to Spanish Portuguese
B	so I believe
A	I remember it being quite difficult at the beginning to learn Spanish just cos I
B	but I believe Finnish is one of the
A	oh really? Oof
B	but the the other at the the the extreme end of the scale I suppose you've got eh Chinese where
A	mm
B	inflections em come into play
A	yes and all the different characters
B	yes
A	they the Chinese students that I was working with they said that em they didn't know all
B	yeah
A	knowledgeable about it cos they're so many
B	mm
B	em well my main hobby I suppose is em model flying
A	mm hm
B	I've built some em model aeroplanes radio-controlled model aeroplanes and em I fly those when the weather is good enough
A	mm hm
B	but now electric motors are coming into force and with the improved technology em in battery manufacturers
A	mm hm
B	and that's
A	how big are they?
B	what? The aeroplanes?
A	uh-huh
B	well the the em internal combustion engine sort of  something like a five foot wing span
A	okay
B	em
A	gosh it's quite large
B	yes
A	not bad
B	yes
B	fortunately I'm breaking fewer of them now
A	yeah
B	fingers crossed
A	and do you make  do you make  them too?
B	when I first started I bought kits of balsa and plywood
A	mm hm
B	and built them from kits but now em it's almost cheaper to buy them built up as almost ready to fly or ARTF em models made in China the Chinese seem to be able to build the complete models so much eh cheaper almost cheaper and you can buy the covering materials for a kit
A	mm hm
B	or from made up almost ready to fly kits
A	mm
B	but you still have to put the tail plane on and the wings and put all the em the electronic the electrical components in it
A	mm
B	for instance the radio receiver and the servers and operate the flying services
A	mm
B	and the engine
A	sounds like fun
B	no
A	uh-huh
B	and eh
A	A where do you go to fly them?
B	em I belong to two clubs one at
A	oh what is that?
B	it's planned to go right across the runway
A	ooh
B	that's the new London to Birmingham high speed rail link
A	that's the
B	and it's planned to go on up to Manchester and Leeds and Scotland in the distant future
A	mm hm
B	very controversial
A	it is
B	I doubt whether it's viable really
A	mm
B	they built one in Holland and I gather that's not eh eh a financial success
A	no
B	and we could end up with another millstone round our necks
A	I believe so and they I thought it was high speed
B	I don't think it does
A	it's only about twenty-five minutes faster
B	there's also some university professor has looked at the em eh the effects on the track of a train travelling at
A	mm
B	the sort of speeds that they're envisaging and he's come to the conclusion that at that speed vibrations will be set up in the rails and that it could be highly dangerous
A	oh
B	so it may well be that em they can't run them as fast as they want to or that they will have to eh strengthen or alter the design of the the the track construction which could put the cost up considerably
A	and is it?
B	I don't know
A	is it definitely going ahead? They've got the green light?
B	I think it's envisaged that it will but you never know what opposition groups could drum up to delay it or put it off
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I think it was there was a celebrity some Stephen Fry-type character who lived there and was up in arms about it and he was leading the whole demonstration campaign to to debunk the idea that it is actually viable and yeah they they had a lot of different arguments like
B	mm
A	it's not actually faster
B	yeah
A	villages
B	yeah
A	the heritage of is it the Chilterns?
B	yes
A	yeah
B	but they're going to tunnel some of it I think
A	really?
B	at great expense
A	again
B	oh have they?
A	and well you I think that's more viable because it's a larger country and it has significantly reduced travelling time
B	well this is what I would have thought about the London to Birmingham one
A	mm
B	it would probably be more viable when it gets eh when it completed and runs right up to Scotland
A	true
B	eh it may then compete with eh with flying
A	mm
B	I don't know what the time is from London to Scotland
A	oh of course
B	she's up there
A	how are they getting on?
B	oh they're getting on alright
A	mm
B	rather than spending their time doing the decorating but eh  but eh
A	oh
B	and they're expecting some lambs at the moment
A	oh lovely
B	em they've got a barn which eh
A	yeah
B	but I don't think any lambs have turned up yet
A	ooh
B	and eh I gather that they haven't got the lambs well the
A	mm
B	they're not really certain which ones are pregnant and which aren't
A	mm hm
B	while
A	mm hm
B	eh to help her look after the children while she goes on a em a a diving coach's course
A	oh wow
B	at
A	mm hm and is she going to become an instructor?
B	well this is the idea that she at the moment she's doing some em teaching for the eh educational teaching with the local authority
A	mm hm
B	up there
A	oh
B	so she's doing this diving instructors course
A	so what is she teaching?
B	diving
A	oh she's?
B	and swimming
A	oh okay swimming
B	yeah
A	oh is that what she was doing?
B	originally yes because she went to work for National Power
A	mm hm
B	em and she went through university sponsored by National Power
A	mm
B	and then became a control systems engineer organising the controls of the power station the coal-fired power stations
A	mm hm
B	and then when she met Alan and he was working at Prestwick on the HMS Gannet Search and Rescue Squadron
A	mm
B	em she em got a job with a sausage skin manufacturing
A	mm
B	firm and did the process control eh computer work for the eh manufacturer of the sausage skins
A	okay
B	well the computer controls the the processes
A	but did she was she being was she very hands on or was she more developing the computer system?
B	well I think she was eh controlling doing the software that controlled what the machines did
A	oh wow so it's programming
B	Cos she I went up there to see her and she showed me around the factory and she'd kick a panel off a machine and twisted that and that so she obviously knew what the various valves and pipes did but eh
A	ah
B	and we saw all the em leather going in at one end which was a bit noxious
B	it was all mixed up and eh mixed in and pumped through a pipe and came out like a long sausage you know a long tube of leather and a long tube of sausage skin it was all folded up backwards and forwards on itself
A	uh-huh
B	ready to go into the em sausage production machines I suppose but
A	oh lovely
B	she reckoned the skins were the best part of the sausages
A	what are the sausage skins made out of?
B	well these particular ones were made of leather
A	leather?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	animal
A	they're very they were very thin the leather was very thin?
B	not particularly no it it was all in a big vat and stirred round with paddles
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I saw a photo of eh some some kind of pink mousse coming out of a you know like a meat grinder?
B	yes
A	and I thought oh what's that? Clicked on it and it was eh something from MacDonald's and I thought
B	minced beef was it?
A	no I thought maybe it was em the milkshake that some kind of
B	oh yes
A	cos it was very it looked like candy floss a little bit
B	oh
A	and it's bright pink
B	and is some of it mechanically removed meat?
A	well
B	because I think mechanically removed meat goes into sausages doesn't it? I think
A	really? I don't know
B	I think
A	eh huh
B	and I think that's mechanically removed meat and it ends up in eh beef burgers and sausages and I'm always a bit suspicious of what
A	I am completely well this this meat the chicken it was pink because they just put the whole chickens through the grinder
B	you've got the bone in there too have you?
A	yeah everything of the chicken is goes in the grinder and that's why it comes out pink obviously cos it of the blood
B	yes
A	and then they bleach it to make it white
B	oh my no
A	and then they add all the cos obviously it tastes foul
B	yes
A	no no pun intended
A	and so they bleach it and then they add all these preservatives and flavourings cos obviously it doesn't taste
B	yeah
A	like what we know chicken to taste like
A	but yes when you find out what how things are made I don't think I'll ever go back to MacDonald's after that
A	so how many children has
B	she's got two
A	ah lovely
B	em not an awful a lot because it's a long way to go but eh she's going over to see
A	mm hm
B	em
A	mm hm
B	and em so he goes over to Ireland for a couple of weeks and then comes home for about a week
A	mm hm
B	but he'll be away when she's can take the children
A	aw
B	for a week at the end of the month
A	mm hm
B	because
A	ooh
B	so I shall see her
A	aw
B	but eh other than that eh probably about I suppose we do quite well we see her about three three or four times a year I suppose
A	aww that's lovely
B	yes
A	ah
B	and they've got a shed and a garden and I they keep my kit in the shed
A	aw
B	every now and again they recharge the batteries for me to look after them
A	and so do they live there permanently?
B	yes
A	ah
B	but they've got grandchildren back here and I think that em they would really like to get back but property in Portugal isn't exactly moving at the moment
A	yeah
B	so I think it could be some time before they
A	mm hm
B	sell the house and the longer it takes the better because when they come back
A	oh dear
A	what a shame
B	no
A	mm hm
B	and she used to go over there I think em just for a break and she met somebody over there or she met somebody and went over there and then I think he died and then she remarried a chap who was a a Brit who was similarly out there
A	mm hm
B	single and eh so they decided to get married and eh they've now got a house together out there
A	oh lovely
B	they've em
A	mm hm
B	already built and he's put up a em one or two extra things and they had a swimming pool put
A	oh lovely
B	in the yard
A	yes
B	but em
A	to Britain
B	it's certainly nice to know somebody out there where you can go out for it makes it eh a relatively an inexpensive holiday if all you've got to do is get a cheap flight to Faro and back
A	definitely
B	yes I did
A	yeah
B	yes I
A	last summer you were having
B	I can even get on the eh Vodafone website
A	uh-huh
B	and em load the
A	you do speak Portuguese
B	load the card now
A	do you understand all the instructions in Portuguese?
B	no
A	just guess
B	I think I know now what to look for to log on and eh em charge the card with a few more points
A	and so the the builder you were talking about? Is he finding does he work in construction?
B	well he really he had a business over here
A	ah okay
B	in engineering
A	mm hm
B	and eh he went out there and looked for work to do and eh he got to know an Irish builder
A	mm hm
B	he did work for this Irish builder and in the end it turned out to be a bit of an apprenticeship he branched off doing things himself and
A	oh okay
B	if he wanted to know how to do it he'd go to this other chap and he's learned that way
A	oh okay
B	em
A	because the construction business there I've got a lot of friends in Spain that em when they left school they went into the construction industry because there were so many jobs
B	yeah
A	and obviously that was ten years ago when there was a lot of construction
B	now there aren't a lot of jobs now I suppose?
A	no
B	well there must be loads of empty properties out there
A	there are
B	this is the problem in Ireland
A	really?
B	built and built and built
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and nobody wants to buy them
A	yeah
B	but em no I was lucky really cos I went over there for a  for a  holiday with
A	oh
B	flies model aeroplanes
A	oh really?
B	so I'll take you to meet him
A	eh huh
B	and em
A	fantastic
B	eventually he said go on push off on your own but don't break my plane
A	do you take your planes over?
B	no I
A	or are you flying his?
B	in in in effect what happened in the end was that the poor chap died
A	oh
B	and em I came to an arrangement with his widow that I had his trainer and one or two bits and pieces and eh I bought some tools out there and other things I needed
A	mm
B	I kept his plane out there
A	aw
B	em but I did have a mishap with it
A	oops
B	so I brought another model out there another trainer and
A	brilliant
B	oh no the it's got to be light stuff so I I got this wing out there within my
A	mm hm
B	weight allowance
B	so the plane's still flying and I've got a spare one
B	yeah but em he had another customer eh or another student that em was a retired mining engineer
A	mm hm
B	and em I got  I got  to know him and then we used to go down there together
A	no
B	but eh
A	mm hm
B	and eh I couldn't get any information from the secretary of the Portuguese club
A	no
B	em eh well they live at Estoi which is not far from Faro
A	eh huh
B	and one of the big towns is Loulé
A	is that north northern Portugal?
B	no
A	southern? Ah okay
B	em I went into the library and I saw a chap at the desk and I thought well I'll try him
A	oh
B	but I found it and em I've I've been I've flown there a few times
A	super
B	but it turns out that he em had a a an English father who travelled out to Portugal and was a got a job out there
A	mm hm
B	and married a Portuguese woman
A	mm
B	and an English father and he was bilingual and worked in the local library
A	and he flew model planes
B	and I'm still in touch with him I went last time I went back I had a a meeting
A	eh huh
B	a coffee with him
A	have you been to fly together?
B	no
A	mm hm
B	they've got the keys in but that they are now going to develop it but it seems as things are very slow moving
A	mm hm
B	so I shall continue to whenever I can eh use the the the
A	and are the Ministry of Defence going to rope you in to do some spy work for them with your planes?
A	mm
B	I think economically they've got their problems
A	yeah
B	and em I think it's slow moving out there
A	mm
B	I don't know whether it's the economic situation that's eh slowing it up or what it is
A	mm
B	but em the first field I went to where Tim used to give me lessons had two runways marked out at right angles so it didn't matter whether you had a north or a south or an east or a west wind
A	mm
B	but this field down by Faro has a north south runway that eh
A	mm
B	so I mean last time I went there there was em eh a a cross wind component and the ground was rather soft
A	mm hm
B	and em the wheels digging into the sand and
A	oops
B	and the less I got em sort of diagonally across the runway into the wind I couldn't get up enough speed to to get the thing off the ground but eh
A	and do you have you mounted cameras onto it?
B	I haven't but em members of the model club have eh got hold of old mobile phones with with video cameras in them as a lot have these days and they strap them to the planes and they've got some quite interesting pictures of the area around the field but we're pretty strictly controlled as to where we can fly
A	right
B	well it's got to be
A	how far you can see
B	how far you can see
A	yeah
B	and as you can imagine if you've watched any even real sized flying
A	mm
B	em the attitude of a
A	mm hm
B	and you can really not be too certain whether it's coming towards you or going away from you
A	mm hm
B	em
A	you
B	and if if if you get it too far away you could easily become disorientated
A	mm hm
B	em
A	and your son-in-law is a pilot isn't he?
B	he is a search and rescue pilot with the Irish coastguard
A	and does he enjoy modal aeroplane flying with you or is that like a
B	no no he doesn't
A	busman's holiday
B	no he's not eh
A	does he just pilot helicopters? Or planes as well?
B	yes oh yes yeah
A	and what will happen after two years?
B	well he'll look for another job but he was hoping that he'd be able to em get a job with the eh
A	is it at the moment it's military?
B	em well it it the R the RAF and the Royal Navy are military and then you've got eh the coastguard operating over here as well
A	mm hm
B	after all the em somewhat hairy flights he does eh in
A	really? Are they?
B	search and rescue I don't think he would really be very keen on doing he sort of bus stop flying that the people flying out to the oil rigs would be doing
A	oh dear
B	yeah
A	she was coordinating the the search and rescue
B	oh was she? Oh
A	but unfortunately they're going to close down that one
B	are they?
A	yeah but she she has some stories
B	oh god
A	I don't know what to do
B	oh
A	and she said she was absolutely
B	well I know he had one case where he had to collect em I think it was a premature baby from somewhere up in
A	he wants the excitement
B	so it's not just sea rescue then it's also land emergencies?
A	no they have to do the em the eh highlands of
B	could he not join the coastguard in in view of the fact that it it hasn't been civilianised
A	well it's a question of
A	prince William is a search and rescue pilot isn't he?
B	yes yes he is yes
A	have they ever met?
B	em
A	oh okay is it all secret?
B	well you know I think there's a yes eh
A	are you looking forward to the jubilee?
B	yes I think so
A	oh that would be nice wouldn't it?
B	I don't know whether you were em
A	when was that would was that forty years? Yeah
B	it it eh
A	ten years ago was it?
B	that would have been
A	oh I don't know then em
B	it'll be twenty-one years is it?
A	oh I don't know
B	twenty years I don't
A	no idea
B	yes we had a good street party then
A	how old were your children then? We can probably work out when it was
B	well if it was twenty year oh they would have been at school
A	oh I don't remember anything any party
B	you don't
A	no
B	well
A	is he? Oh
B	and
A	yeah like Andrew
B	is he? And you're what a year behind
A	I think I was three
B	or two years was it?
A	three years younger than
B	are you? mm
A	yeah cos
B	ah right
A	were they?
B	I think they were yes
A	was she born in seventy-two?
B	seventy-one I think
A	what month?
B	October
A	yeah so she would have been in the same school year as my brother
B	oh right
A	pushing forty as well nearly
B	but em
A	oh wow
B	product change management
A	what kind of products?
B	well he developed an interest in this when he was in the RAF through what he regarded as the difficulty is using em NATO stock number to control the quality and whereabouts of various bits and pieces
A	oh so it's like stock control and
B	well it it it it is it's it's stock control but also em if you change your specification you change the part number and if you want to do something with the part number how do you relate the old design to the new design
A	interesting
B	well I think one of the problems is that it isn't a very well documented subject
A	mm
B	and because of that there isn't a lot that he can kind to read up about it
A	research and things
B	but anyway it
A	oh and where's he based?
B	he lives at Old Sodbury
A	where's that?
B	em north of the M4 somewhere between Bristol and Bath
A	ah okay
B	on the bottom of the Cotswolds
A	oh
B	and Valerie and I did the Cotswold Way walk and the first day we did it we left Bath and walked up towards Old Sodbury and we got within about seven miles of their house
A	wow
B	and we stopped and had a meal at a pub and then got a taxi home
A	how long did that take you sixteen hours what sixteen miles sorry
B	it probably took us about six hours I should think
A	wow
B	well yeah I should think we we probably did yeah
A	so you've got five grandchildren?
B	I've got five grandchildren
A	that's a lot of birthdays to remember isn't it? Do any of your grandchildren enjoy flying your model planes
B	I think they're interested but eh I don't see enough of them really to
A	how long does it take to drive to Bath or wherever they are
B	about an hour and a half an hour and three quarters to get down to Old Sodbury
A	could be further
B	could be yeah
A	yeah
B	what to get to Scotland?
A	yeah
B	well we reckon to allow seven hours
A	is that going
B	but I think
A	is Val going with you?
B	no no she's not
A	oh right it's your turn
B	so this is the second time so I said I'll go
A	aw
B	well yes but I do it in bits and pieces
A	can't your son-in-law just come and pick you up and
B	that would be good wouldn't it? Yeah yeah yeah
A	Cos he was taking
A	that's right yeah
B	yes he did
A	you've got someone interested behind you
B	hello
A	you're being visited
B	well I enjoy going with
A	why not? Why's that?
B	well I don't know I think it's just that aeroplanes appeal to me but em
A	do you play at pirates when you're out there
B	no I don't think so
A	ah you can never bank on what the weather's going to do can you?
B	well the first time we went we didn't get out of the harbour
A	uh-huh
B	and the last time we went down there we
A	oh nice
B	yes it is yeah yeah
A	gorgeous there is it the Solent Solent that you have to cross to get there? We went there
B	but em
A	and did you sleep in the boat or?
B	yes I did yeah yeah
A	what was that like?
B	oh it was just quite comfortable
A	I've never slept in it
B	haven't you?
A	no
B	well it's eh
A	too many spiders
B	I would say it's probably more comfortable than sleeping in a a tent but eh
A	true
B	which I have done within the last twelve months with the cadets
A	and did you  did you  get the pressure cooker out and make a meal?
B	oh no no we usually have cold meals
A	mm
B	oh does he?
A	yeah
B	has he got a pressure cooker on the boat I I haven't seen that
A	and he's got a recipe book for pressure cooker cooking
B	but in the summer we're quite happy with cold meals
A	true
B	so em I think it was what a couple of years ago I joined the cadets on a walk from Weston super Mare to Purbeck
A	no
B	they leave Weston super Mare and past Cheddar Gorge and Wookey Hole
A	what a fantastic name Wookey Hole
B	right across to the em Dorset coast round by Doodle Door and along to Purbeck and then they camp for the weekend at Purbeck
A	lovely
B	and it's a good walk
A	Dorset's a beautiful place isn't it?
B	yes we had two or three nights in each place and then they would bus the cadets to where they were going to start the walk and pick them up at the end
A	and a lot of walking no?
B	A lot of walking but eh
A	A lot of blisters?
B	no no they all did did very well yes
A	I'd like to do the em the Saint James Way in the North of Spain
B	oh is there a Saint James Way?
A	yeah the Camino de Santiago it's called
B	yes
A	or from near the French border and all across the top
B	is that where the Santander Bank came from?
A	oh I think they took their name from there yes
B	no
A	but eh yeah it goes all the way to Santiago which is the de Compostella which is on the East coast just above Portugal actually
B	well we I I listened to a program on the radio about Andalucia
A	well you wouldn't want to do any walking there
B	I said to Valerie that I thought she'd find it interesting from the historical point of view
A	uh-huh
B	have you been round there and then
A	lovely
B	but it's all the old em
A	yeah it's beautiful isn't it? I love the gardens in Alhambra
B	oh did you?
A	and sat around the pond having our sandwiches
B	yes yes
A	did you do a lot of research before you went?
B	yes a fair bit
A	and which which city did you prefer?
B	well I suppose we didn't see that much of the individual cities because we went to the em
A	and did you go and see any Flamenco shows in Granada?
B	no no no
A	no? I love that area when you're coming down for the Alhambra towards the city and there's lots of white little white houses on the hill
B	I'm sure you do
A	yeah although today's beautiful
B	it is isn't it?
A	it's a sunny day yeah
B	no she's out in her canoe with the Birmingham canoe club
A	oh super
B	she's em
A	you're not cooking?
B	I may well do I if she's gone out for the day and I can't and the weather's not right for flying and I don't get out I I usually cook the joint for the
