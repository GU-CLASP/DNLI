B	that was left it was left on the side for weeks
D	oh that's alright then use it fucking idiot
A	I've seen that actually that's been around for ages
D	you know what it probably was
B	no it was on the side I thought oh this is because I noticed it had been there a while
C	whoever used it didn't put it away is what happened
B	yeah
D	just it makes it softer
A	you know it has been rinsed
D	there's a hunt on when I find you
A	I've probably used the washing powder because
D	well that's alright then
A	when the no when the washing powder goes low I buy some new washing powder and put it out there so I just assume I treat that as like
D	that's alright then
A	yeah but if you've got if you've got stuff like that don't leave it out because it will get taken
D	it wasn't left out it was under the sink
C	I left it under the sink and I came back afterwards because I was at his for about a week and I came back it was by the bloody washing machine
C	why is she
A	I use it if it is there but with that I yeah well I replace it
D	like the other day I got up in the morning when everybody cooks like six AM I got a roll of kitchen roll out I came back upstairs went down at midday and half of it was gone
A	was it on the side?
D	yeah
C	oh that's communal though
D	who uses half a kitchen roll in like a morning?
A	because people use if it's if there's a spillage
B	I mean you probably used that to cover up all your fucking pans and that
A	if there's a spillage people
D	I didn't use fucking half a roll
C	I use it
A	well it's a waste like if you are going to use like five or six things at once just use a sponge because it will do the same job and just use one
C	yeah
D	it's probably fucking him that's why he's so fucking quiet look at him
C	I haven't fucking used that what would I use half a fucking kitchen roll for?
A	he's never fucking quiet
D	he's sitting there quiet he's thinking oh let's let me hear what else they've got so I can think about
