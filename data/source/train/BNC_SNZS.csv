A	so what was our plan?
B	if I was like a famous singer or or did a famous book or did a
B	famous film er or a famous rock star and I might then if I get loads of money I would give it to the hospital the one you were talking about
A	Great Ormond Street
B	and the Watersaid and the Wateraid company
A	mm
B	and
A	because we were just talking about Peter Pan weren't we?
B	aha
A	mm
B	because
A	mm
B	do you think there were clouds in that little bit?
A	sorry?
B	they showed you a bit where
C	that
A	yeah no it's exciting though that film
B	yeah and there and there was clouds coming down
C	and stealing
A	from where?
C	and erm from the sky into an orphanage they're stealing all the children there
A	oh
C	they turn into pirates
A	including Peter I guess?
C	yeah
B	including Peter
A	my goodness me that sounds a bit scary
B	and did you know
A	mm
B	that the captain was not called Captain Hook he was called
C	James Hook
B	no Black no Blackbeard the other one
C	oh yeah
B	and then he had the friend called James Hook and I don't know how but some but for some reason he turned I think he turned no
C	he no James Hook was actually a good pirate
A	right
C	erm before he erm before he got his hand bitten off by a crocodile
A	what and then he becomes?
C	and then he and then he killed erm Blackbeard or something
A	oh I see
C	like
B	no they chopped off his hand and threw it to the crocodile
C	yeah
A	oh that sounds like a good film
C	I really want to watch it
A	mhm
C	I think it would be like all the
B	and I think all the other and I and do you know mum I think that all the other little boys pirate boys
A	mm
B	are the Lost Boys
A	are they now?
C	yeah they're a little lost and I'm wondering though eventually I think
A	do you think it's a place that's real then?
C	well if you're like in if you were there you would be able to explore every single part of it cos it has a limited amount of space and it would take us ages and you would have enough time erm on your hands to explore it although you would never have enough time to explore earth
A	I'm sure the Lost Boys have explored it a lot
C	yeah like they have just probably explored it
B	they live in an oak
C	yeah they live in a
A	in a big oak tree?
C	and they would have been there
B	yeah
C	they would have been there enough to erm know their ways around it quite a lot
A	yeah well they know about the mermaids don't they?
C	yeah and the pirates
A	and Tiger Lily
C	and the Indians
B	well in the one in but the mermaids in the real Peter Pan
A	mm
B	they are
A	indeed
C	mm Smee's not very nasty
A	I like Smee
C	he's really funny
B	yeah because he doesn't really like he doesn't really like being a pirate
A	well he's not evil is he?
C	no he's not a bad pirate
A	I don't know if James Hook is evil either
C	well he isn't but he was
A	mm
C	I mean he he is but he wasn't he wasn't once
A	mm
B	yeah I wonder how
C	because if you
A	it did well that is his name isn't it? James T Hook isn't it?
A	we haven't seen that Tinker Bell film for ages
B	it was really funny
A	it was good wasn't it?
B	yeah and I really like it
A	he tricked her didn't he?
B	mm cos she's a fairy that got banned from fairy from fairyland
A	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
B	yes
C	and the really big beast that actually keeps them from dying but they thought it was a baddie?
A	a beast? what's that one?
C	in Tinker Bell I think it's Tinker Bell
A	mm
C	or something like that and
B	Tinker Bell and the Neverbeast
C	yeah the Neverbeast
A	I haven't seen that
B	it's really really good
C	yeah it's fun
B	it's really good and they think the beast's really horrible but actually it's harmless
C	yeah and it isn't harmless but it can erm but it does save their life but they all
A	is this a full-length film?
C	yeah
A	I haven't seen that one at all
B	oh?
C	and they're only realising it too late
B	where?
A	what happens?
B	it's about it's about not Tinkerbell but another fairy
C	yeah
B	one of her friends
C	she's a nature one she's
A	oh okay right
C	my personal favourite
B	and she and she gets this out and hides it in blackberries but she doesn't but and she does haunt fairies but it's
C	it's a baby
B	it's a baby so the so the so I think she's trying to make it so it doesn't eat fairies
A	mm
B	and then
C	yeah
B	all the then all the big elves come and all the and all the
C	yeah they erm I'm not sure what they do and I'm not sure if I want to know what they do
B	they just get the
A	mm
B	if they can
C	they might have to do a bit of violence
B	they do a little bit of violence
C	mm I told you I didn't want to know what the what it was and I was right
B	like throwing nets that's all they just throw nets
A	they just what?
B	they just throw nets at them
C	and zero percent
B	they've got
A	and does it hurt them if they throw nets?
B	they've got sleeping gas no it doesn't hurt them if they throw nets
A	alright
C	it depends where they throw them at
A	how big is this beast though? what is the beast?
C	like fairy fairy is about this
B	this is the beast
C	if the fairy was this size
A	but fairies are tiny aren't they?
B	yeah they're like the fairy is this size and the
C	the fairy look if a fairy was this size and the beast if the fairy was this size
A	mm
B	mm
C	then the beast then the beast is that size
A	but it's nothing that we know it's not an animal that we know?
C	no it's not an animal we know
B	yeah because it doesn't have normal
A	okay
C	but anyway erm after they destroy it and it made four towers which meant that he could like they would attract the light the green lightning
A	mm
C	that would that would either if they went to there they would erm they wouldn't they wouldn't do anything but if they didn't get on there they would destroy the whole of Neverland
B	no
C	that
B	fairyland
C	oh yeah fairyland
A	mm
C	and including every single fairy on it
B	but the but they
C	yeah they destroyed one tower they managed to shoot a big rock and it and destroyed one tower and then and then the Neverbeast was trying to make another one and got shot by lightning
A	oh dear
C	and so one of the fairies
B	it stopped it stopped the storm
A	mm
B	and she's got shocked as well she got shocked as well
C	yeah she got shocked as well but not that badly
B	and she was
C	and then and then she gave the electricity into him
B	and he woke up
A	oh
B	yes but he was very tired and he just got
C	yeah and he had to go back to his and he had to go back to his sleep
B	for a hundred years
A	a hundred years?
B	was it a thousand or a hundred?
A	probably a hundred
B	a hundred
A	that's kinda like a fairytale
B	but they made it erm but they made erm like if he ever got thirsty
A	mm
B	there's some water for him and in case he got scared of the dark they'd get some they gave him some light so they might
A	ah
B	and I'm not sure if fairies ever die?
A	no I don't think so
B	so they'd be able to see him again
A	mm
B	but not for a hundred years and I think they knew and I think they knew that he was very nice and kind and gentle yeah and she probably got a and she probably got a lot of pixie dust because
A	I like the pixie dust tree
B	what about that was that like the
A	mm
B	because in the big pixie dust tree
A	mm
B	there's erm there was a pixie dust there was like this
A	oh yeah
B	and then they shattered it and it went onto a tree to give it but it just looked really good so then and a
A	it went sort of stronger didn't it in the end I think?
B	oh yeah and they didn't punish Tinker Bell
A	no thank goodness
B	but the main thing is that Tinker Bell always seems to do like
A	get in trouble and things?
B	she always seems to be very adventurous and very
A	she is adventurous isn't she?
B	it's like when she went to that island
C	so is a nature fairy to be fair
A	but that's not normal for fairies is it? normally they like to just stick to what they know
B	but she's like
A	mm
B	with bubbles
A	oh yes
B	they're stealing things
A	they're the tinkers aren't they?
B	eating
B	well Tinker's a tinker
A	yes she is also a fairy that's that tinkers but that's sort of their their job isn't it?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	not all of them although that nature fairy was very adventurous in the
A	was that a boy fairy?
C	no a girl
A	okay okay
C	and she managed to
B	and I think
C	and that beast and they thought that beast could have and and that they thought that beast could have killed her
A	mm
C	and she wasn't take and she wasn't erm hearing any of it she was just making sure he felt at home
A	very brave
C	she did tell the other fairies in the end
A	okay
B	yeah and they knew
C	about her friends
B	and they realised she was harmless and erm and mum?
A	mm
B	Tink has this friend which is a boy and I think she might marry and I think she might get him as a boyfriend
A	is that the boy with blonde hair?
B	yeah I do too
A	maybe they'll get married later
A	they make a speak properly they make a film where she marries him and?
B	maybe they make a
A	mm
B	and or he's her boyfriend and
A	and they have a baby?
B	they they don't because they
A	maybe she's gonna be a troublesome baby and like when she's a toddler get up to any dangerous things
B	yeah
A	that Tinker Bell would
B	and there was like this big falling
C	danger a huge teetering rock
A	and she's somehow always saved
B	and then and sometimes she's really really clever
C	and then do you know what happens?
A	hang on
B	and somehow she's really clever so just jumps on the rock
A	mm yes
C	and it would be funny if she
A	mm
C	and then that
A	and you think she's gone been squished and then she hasn't?
C	yeah they think she's been squished
B	and she's
C	and she's
A	she's gonna end up on top of the rock?
C	yeah yeah boing no she goes boing on top of the rock and na na na
