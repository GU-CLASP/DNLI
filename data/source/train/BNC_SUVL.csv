A	if if if you wanted it beyond the trial just give your credit card details then don't trick people because they're forgetful
C	but they're

A	er he put I just I I couldn't understand him so I wanted to be sure before I start asking for a table and I just
D	you can book online
C	can every table this is next
A	yeah but I I think it said just to erm
C	this is
A	like and they be more direct like just to make sure because online bookings may be I dunno
B	mm
A	I just I feel like it's safer to call them
B	mm
A	cos then you can say I called you know I didn't
C	I hate calling up I'd rather do everything online
D	same
A	I would as well but I need to practise calling people cos I hate doing it as well
B	mm
A	that I need to get used to doing it
C	I forgot are you recording this?
A	yes
B	that's what the flashing light on her phone means
C	oh
C	now you can have that on your recording
A	oh
C	eh
A	you only
A	was going hello and then
C	is it just you analyse this? or
A	no
C	alright
A	so it's easy
C	so they're asking you to do the study for them?
A	no I'm doing the data collection I'm helping the data collection
B	yeah
A	I'm not doing anything else
C	I guess they can't go into random people's houses and say can we record your conversation?
A	no no
C	ha ha
A	no yeah
C	well this is a great conversation sounds like there's loads of action
B	you don't have a TV?
D	yeah
C	so you just watch it on your phone
D	I didn't know that it had finished
D	like I came home
D	and I was like oh so how's the Rugby World Cup going?
D	and I was like well erm
C	sorry I'm I'm uncomfortable in that chair
D	well who won?
B	all I do is watch TV
C	work and TV
B	yeah
D	and we can't even watch stuff live on like Iplayer cos you don't have to have a TV licence to do that you can watch stuff like
A	I think loads of people in our flat just ignore that rule our first year rep told us they're they're unlikely to catch you
D	we got a scary letter saying they were investigating our flat
D	so we have to all like declare that we didn't need one online
A	no I mean I my I got one erm
B	yeah mm
A	you know to connect so we could watch Freeview erm
D	yeah
A	but they didn't tell us that they didn't tell us that it'd be different they just said oh you're gonna be in a graduate block
D	oh do you have your TV with you?
A	yeah it's still at uni I was gonna bring it home
D	mm
A	erm and just leave it there but
D	yeah
A	erm my mum was complaining that I was already bringing too much stuff home so I left it I'm gonna just leave it in my
D	yeah
D	individual TV licence for every room in your flat
A	yeah
D	if you want one
A	mm
C	do you?
D	whereas when you're in a house in second year you can just get a licence for the house
B	I think
D	so it's a lot cheaper so we're gonna do it that way
C	that's what you do like normally in a house you just have one
D	yeah I know but at university accommodation
B	yeah you have to have one
D	you have to do it separately so I'd have to pay you know like a hundred and thirty pounds whereas if I do it next year we split a hundred and thirty pounds between six of us
C	but you only have to pay it for the privilege of BBC channels
B	yeah
C	that is why the TV licence exists
D	no you actually have to have it to watch ITV as well
C	do you?
D	yeah erm it's just that
C	there's like those those five channels is why you pay a hundred and thirty pound all the other channels
B	yeah
D	I dunno
A	I think
B	mm
A	so it's already it's already included I think
D	that's nice
A	yeah
D	yeah some houses include broadband as well
A	yeah
A	ours is ninety-five per week I think
D	what?
A	yeah
D	I pay a hundred and twelve in my student accommodation a week
A	no no that's not that's not
D	alright how much do you pay?
D	okay
A	I think it's cheaper than a lot of other people in erm
D	oh so I don't even have en suite
A	no
D	okay
C	is that just
A	yeah that's just
D	bills is included
A	yeah that's just the accommodation
D	yeah
A	like maintenance
D	mm we erm
A	mm
D	which is like
A	yeah but I use it I spend it on food and things I don't really spend it on much else
D	mm
B	yeah
A	my mum's trying to get a job
B	mm
A	cos she wants to get a job and she's trying it's just not working out
D	don't they still take into account erm
A	I think so
D	again it depends on like income but obviously like if you have two parents earning
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	so
D	mm
A	and that yeah
D	shit phone
C	er don't get any of that
C	just get money in
B	mm?
C	bills
B	mm
D	do you know
A	I have no idea
C	probably in June or something like that
A	no it'll be earlier than that I think because
C	will it?
A	yeah it takes them a while to process it
D	tell me about it
B	no he was still at home
A	oh he's still
C	apparently he's still at home
C	now
B	is that him?
C	well he must be
A	it's not been an hour
B	hasn't been a whole hour
C	I don't know when he called so
B	before
C	okay
A	yeah it's been half an hour
B	maybe he's really lost
D	mm
A	I need the toilet
C	that's
A	erm which one is it?
B	just at the top of the stairs
A	okay
D	would you be able to give me a lift home tonight?
B	yeah
D	is that okay?
B	yeah
D	my mum she's got
C	I wonder if anyone's ever started a bras band?
B	what is that supposed to mean?
C	just loads of people turning up in bras trying to play the
C	no no no no
C	it's a bras band
B	obviously
C	I don't know
D	what noise do bras make?
B	this is being recorded
C	boing
D	no they don't
D	no
B	okay
D	cool
C	so the thing is they can analyse me now because I forgot about it before so
B	now that you've remembered
C	yeah basically
C	probably
B	mm
C	should get bonus for that
D	it's annoying like I'll wake I'll
C	what is it? you just just your throat closed up a bit?
D	yeah my glands are really swollen like here
C	right
D	erm and I've got like the white spots in the back of my that on my tonsils and like does this horrible thing where you know the bit that dangles in the middle?
C	what the
D	that thing
D	gets stuck to the side
B	oh
D	cos they're so swollen that erm I'm covered in like er stuff
C	what bit are your tonsils? I never know
B	you can see them if you look down your throat
D	and you can see them when they're swollen cos they sort of like lift up
C	I obviously can't look down my throat
B	obviously then you try
D	yeah you look in a mirror with a torch and you go
C	is it the bit behind? cos you've got
D	they're like parallel to to the
C	oh so oh it's that bit?
D	yeah
B	you can actually you can actually see them
C	oh I thought that was just like a wall
D	no
B	it's not just the size of your throat it's
D	the
C	well cos it's not cos it like comes down like curtains
D	and there's a difference cos a lot of people get viral tonsillitis that's just when you have a sore throat and your throat's a bit red and swollen
D	when you have bacterial it's your glands get swollen
D	you can get headaches
C	to your tonsilites
B	it sounds really gross
D	it it's really it's
C	how can you even feel it? I never felt mine
B	well you could probably
D	no I don't wanna I haven't felt them because that would probably make me gag but
C	no not like
B	no but you could feel it in your mouth
C	I I I don't think I've ever known that there's something in my mouth
D	no you couldn't
C	yeah
D	here
C	yeah I guess
D	yeah
B	look someone's here
D	like when I turn my neck like this I can feel it
B	mm
D	and that's I had bacterial
C	what
B	you can't
A	that's just a regular cold
D	but it's not as bad
C	so what cases do they have to remove your tonsils?
D	if you have it more than four times I think
B	when when you have
D	I have it quite often but not that often
D	mm
B	erm she has carers and she's like sick at the moment so they're supposed to be giving her antibiotics and the carers weren't giving her all the antibiotics
D	yeah
B	and then suggested to
D	what?
B	I was like oh my god
D	that's illegal
B	yeah
D	that's illegal
B	yeah
D	like withdrawing treatment
B	yeah
D	oh my god
B	so
B	cos that's really inappropriate
D	yeah
B	I just think oh my god
D	yeah
D	as well as swallowing like five knives it you
C	oh
D	yeah the bit
C	is that like the left ear front ear and final front ear?
B	what's the middle ear? I only have two
C	is that like your left ear your right ear and your final front ear?
D	like so if you have a throat infection
B	yeah
D	or a erm
A	yeah
B	what's a what's a middle ear?
D	it's just a part of your ear
C	it's not a middle ear it's the middle of the ear
B	it's the middle of your ear
D	yeah it's the middle part of like
C	the ear canal?
D	anatomy of your ear
B	okay
D	no it's
C	did you just say amatomy?
D	anatomy
D	anatony no no no
C	anatoly
D	but yeah so it's not
B	was that even
D	just sort of like
C	I don't know
B	cos I I saw some headlights
C	that could be anyone
B	well yeah but last time I saw some lights it was
D	wait did
B	I don't know she turned up
D	she told me she was gonna walk cos
C	she came she saw she left
D	if she said she was trying driving I was gonna be like give me a lift
A	I dunno I guess she must have walked or got a lift
C	well she's going to
D	she said that she was gonna walk and then go walk home and then drive to
B	mm
C	she was knew she was gonna drive to
B	yes
D	oh my parents haven't insured me on the car
C	what has your insurance run out?
D	no I only got temporary insured over the summer
C	ah
D	cos there was no point in me going on for a year and then I was gonna get insured for a month over Christmas and my parents were like

C	yeah we pay all that money to go to uni for half a year
D	assignments coursework
A	I'm going to have seven exams it's gonna feel like GCSEs all over again
D	but the annoying thing is is that you pay nine grand it works out that you pay you you're paying thirty-one pounds seventy-five or something an hour to be at uni
A	I don't think
D	and that's an hour that you're actually in uni
A	first year doesn't even count and you still have to pay like
C	I'm glad my company pay for what I do like one of the first things that I did when I went to college was like a crash course it was like a week intensive course for

E	I only asked for two shifts a week
D	no I'm doing full time thirty-seven and a half hours in three weeks

D	Boots over Christmas
E	oh did you get a
D	yeah
E	ah
D	do you have your car?
E	I'm gonna bring it down this
D	oh do you have parking?
E	some people have their
E	well some of my coursemates have their cars down and it's really useful because
C	let's drive to the woods
D	you're lucky you have parking we we have like ten parking spaces for like the six hundred rooms that we have
E	do you?
D	it's that small
E	no
D	mm
E	or the train everywhere
C	my car broke down in November so November? October so
E	is it dead?
C	had to take the train
E	for two days
A	woah
C	it wasn't nice though
A	er
C	you know how much it cost me?
C	no twenty-two pound
D	it cost me twenty-seven pounds for a day return to be honest
C	a return? but this is from here to London
D	yeah this it's twenty it's a thirty-five minute journey from
C	really?
D	twenty-eight pounds for a day return and next day return is like thirty-seven
C	do you have a railcard?
D	I do now
E	with a railcard a return from Reading to
C	eh
E	so I have to
D	how many times have you been home?
E	this is my fourth time home
D	that's quite a bit
A	I didn't come home at all
E	but I I had to come home for diving twice
D	ah
E	and then obviously er we had reading week
D	yeah
C	what you do your diving training here?
E	well I did it in Somerset
C	right
E	but I came home so that
D	mm
C	oh
E	and then back again
E	I went all down the south that weekend
E	mm
A	and so we don't have lectures then but I still have to go to psychology so it doesn't really feel like time off but
E	wait do you do two subjects?
A	yeah we have to do erm in our first year we have to do a minor
E	you have to?
A	you don't
E	mm
A	you don't your major doesn't fill up enough credits so you have to take erm a minor or either that or you have a joint major
C	it doesn't really make sense because
E	mm
C	of something we've decided you have to do two to make up for it
A	yeah I mean
E	I'm just learning about science though
A	yeah
E	I'm just learning biology
C	I think I'm doing a stupid amount of credits this year I think I'm doing like a hundred and fifty
D	I do a hundred and twenty
A	I think I do a hundred and twenty as well
C	I might even do more
E	this is the first time I've heard of credits
D	you need a certain amount of credits
C	I don't really understand it you need to pass a subject to get the credits but the credits no the
D	what's your pass rate?
C	the grade you don't
D	yeah but your grade no ours is you your credits just so that you can finish the year
C	yeah cos it
D	but then you have to get forty percent in each module to pass erm
C	yeah
A	mm right
C	cos I think it's like if you pass the subject you get the full amount of credits like a pass
D	oh okay so ours is a
C	yeah that
D	yeah
B	what
D	it's so that you can move on to like the next thing if you don't have a hundred and twenty credits you don't get let into second year if you don't pass
D	mm but they do they're really strict about late things if you submit late by like a couple of seconds yours gets capped at forty percent
C	you get capped at
D	yeah
C	yeah we get that as well supposedly but they just moved the deadlines
E	what so you can't get
C	the
D	no so you have to like you could get seventy percent but then they'll say you got forty so you've still passed but you won't get the seventy percent that you got marked down you
C	it's because the merit and distinction criteria are that you hand stuff in on time you meet deadlines so by
C	that's ridiculously generous
D	that's so lenient I know one university is at least
E	a deadline's a deadline
D	if it's up to five days late
B	mm
D	you only get docked five percent
C	what?
B	at work if we're late the client gets charged and we have to pay for it
A	erm
B	yeah
C	responsibilities
E	I've been really good with deadlines so far
A	I've been good as well I got
E	like I've done them beforehand the night before
C	I've had about
A	I've for my for my
A	for my first essay I got all my research done
C	yeah cos I've got assignments for each subject and they have like mini tasks in them
A	I was saying for for my first essay I got all my research done cos it's really annoying because you have to you have to search for things outside of your lecture notes
A	so so like look at cos you have to have to read journal articles of of the actual research itself
D	I never read a full journal article
A	yeah yeah I I I don't read the I don't like read it thoroughly I just skim and look at the important points but mainly I just read the abstract and see if it will fit with my essay erm
D	yeah
A	I've been organised
D	I had
D	at three thirty
E	mm
D	so
D	and if
B	mm
D	all online so if you accidentally submit the wrong thing can't get
C	turn it in is rubbish
D	you can't get it back
A	you we use turn it in
C	one of the guys I work with got like twenty-six percent it like highlighted an entire page
D	oh
C	but it it like highlights page numbers like you you've like you
D	I only got nine percent
A	I couldn't I couldn't see
D	could you not see
A	no I I think I think it was called like the originality report so I couldn't see it had had no values on it on a percentage
D	sometimes the tutors don't let you see
A	I don't know why though I'm I'm I didn't plagiarise at least if I it seemed like I
D	no
A	I assumed that it was fine
D	sometimes yeah it's just teachers erm don't actually let you see your
A	that that's silly though cos what if there's things that you've done wrong and you need to see where you've done it wrong? so
D	yeah
A	I dunno it's a bit stupid but
D	I got eighty percent on my first
A	I don't I don't know cos they they they did meta grades for some reason so I got a B plus
D	yeah
A	but
D	I had a lab report as well that I did but I don't know the marks for it yet
E	he got those page numbers from a website
C	yes
C	I've got headings for a table as well
C	have you got like references and bibliography? I'm sure you have

E	we're using
C	oh right
E	so kind of lazy but
E	yeah
C	but we were like we haven't been taught how to do this
C	cos like I understand now you have to like you
E	yeah
C	it is
E	we should get a specific way to do it as well
C	the thing is there's there there isn't is there? cos it's called Harvard referencing but everywhere does it different
E	yeah
C	yeah
E	I don't know never written an essay
C	yeah

C	oh you're talking about Legoland I thought she was talking about Boots
D	and we also don't have to queue because of my brother so
C	so you're abusing him
E	just cos he has diabetes
D	yeah because he can't yeah I don't want it
C	but he can go on thrill rides
D	yeah because that doesn't make a difference
E	yeah apparently
C	I know
D	if he's in hot weather his blood sugar can erm drop or drastically change
C	he sweats out sugar
D	and if he needs to leave the queue suddenly to like check his blood sugar then it's unfair because he's just queued for like an hour but he has to leave
C	isn't adrenaline like a factor in diabetes or?
D	oh yeah when he when when he goes on the rides I mean we went to Thorpe Park last summer
C	right
D	for him to
C	no I'm not saying it was
D	he just has to keep
C	fluctuate
D	yeah fluctuate
B	how do you tell your blood sugar levels?
A	use a prick thing
D	yeah prick his finger with the machine and then
E	oh yeah a erm bio
C	yeah you prick your finger which bleeds
A	bio
E	bio
D	it's not a piece of paper it's test strips
E	we learnt about it in biology
A	yeah I had to use one of those for this erm psychology experiment that I did
D	oh
A	do it three times
E	yeah
D	yeah
C	it doesn't hurt
A	it it's not that bad it's just I didn't want it
E	is it just like blood dissolving
D	but then he has to be
A	but it it it's a it's a test strip
E	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The test it's a pregnancy one.	Neutral
D	but then he has to do one two three four injections like it's not like er one after the other but like breakfast lunch dinner
D	before bed
C	right
D	so yeah
D	and he's meant to be a priority for the flu jab but he never got his letter
C	what like
A	it's alright
[ANNOTATION]	Only one injection is enough.	Contradiction
D	no the flu jab
E	you want pizza?
D	cos not everyone gets the flu jab
B	the pregnant people
D	long-term pregnant people
D	erm and
C	oh that reminds me of a picture I saw is it Caitlyn Jenner who's now a man?
D	yeah
C	was one of
D	well
B	the other way round
B	is Caitlyn a man's name?
C	was
D	it was
C	was it? it was a man and now a woman
D	it was Bruce Jenner
[ANNOTATION]	There is some pepperoni pizza on the table.	Neutral
C	there was a picture of like and it was captioned men want to prove that they're better women than everything that they won woman of the year or something like that
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Caitlyn is a woman.	Contradiction
B	wait women are so much
C	yeah
D	people were saying that she shouldn't have won erm
A	that's not comfortable
D	woman of the year not because not disputing like the whole transgender thing but saying that
A	yeah yeah
D	and she's been charged
C	and?
A	she killed someone
D	she's been charged for that
[ANNOTATION]	Someone was accused of stealing.	Contradiction
B	I I
C	what what qualifies you for woman of the year?
E	who?
D	you're meant to be like a
C	like most charitable
B	yes but
[ANNOTATION]	Emma Watson qualifies for the woman of the year.	Neutral
E	who made the most sandwiches?
B	Hitler was man of the
B	in Time magazine Hitler was man of the year
E	of the year
D	really?
B	yes
D	oh
B	because he
E	Hitler?
B	he he had a
B	an affect on the world that's what made him man of the year not because he did something good
D	oh but this
C	so does IS but
B	yeah
D	this is Glamour magazine woman of the year not
B	oh well
D	not Time
B	mm
D	cos that's probably what they were saying with Hitler
A	I think I think I think there are transgender people that are more influential than Caitlyn I I don't
C	I don't know any
B	I I think
A	I I I just hate
E	yeah
A	that family in general
D	yeah same
A	cos cos they're just so attention-seeking and like I I remember
E	and
A	I know I remember I watched this thing where a news reporter got really angry cos
E	Kylie Jenner
D	yeah
A	she she got a new rabbit
A	and named it er after
E	Bruce
A	Bruce and she she named her rabbit Bruce or something
E	Bruce
A	and it was news
C	Finding Nemo
A	and and it was on the news and the news reporter got so angry so this isn't news I'm not I'm not I'm not telling you this
B	I I saw a news article
E	good
B	that erm
B	like like is this what
C	have you seen that Harry's dating Pippa which is Kate's sister who's married to someone
B	yeah
D	yeah but that's not confirmed
C	I know but it's
B	it's speculated
D	that's just speculation
C	it's keeping it in the family just
D	it's a bit weird isn't it? like I dunno
C	I mean it it's not wrong whatsoever
D	no no
B	what dating my brother-in-law?
C	but it means like your your brother-in-law
C	definitely is your brother-in-law
C	is your brother-in-law
B	yeah
C	just just in case you weren't related enough
D	that's so
C	yeah cos then your husband would also be
D	no you'd be brother-in-law times two
B	mm?
A	I'm just checking how long it'd been on
B	how long has it been on?
A	about an hour and a half
D	so your husband would also be your brother-in-law
E	how much time do you
C	that's weird
D	yeah so
B	and your brother's
D	no and your sister's husband would be your brother-in-law times two
D	no I'm like so Kate
B	yeah
D	and so if Pippa and Harry marry
C	I'm confused
B	because
C	no don't explain it
C	Pippa
B	if she gets married her husband becomes Kate's brother-in-law
D	but Harry already is Kate's brother-in-law
E	oh
A	yeah so that that's why I've had it
E	really? do you get paid for this?
A	yeah that's why otherwise I wouldn't be doing it
E	is it for a study that has is being done at uni? or
A	yeah yeah it's for erm
E	oh yeah
A	it's a it's a erm
E	oh okay
A	I think it's mainly for linguistics students but erm
E	that's fine and you get paid for it that's
A	yeah
E	yeah
B	yeah
D	so if they got married they'd be brother-in-law times two
C	oh don't family trees are so complicated
C	don't need to make it worse now
D	cousins squared
A	I dunno
C	well that's
B	he'd be like your uncle once removed and your and your dad or something
D	oh
C	big baboon
E	it's getting smaller
C	it's like all falling out the bottom
E	mm
A	I remember really liking
B	lava lamps are cool

A	I don't use it any more actually but I've got a glitter lamp with fish in it
C	oh

C	I I don't want to be judgemental
D	I I'd rather have like a
C	but it's probably they don't want to get an abortion or they want to keep the child for whatever reason
