A	just for fun
B	okay I wanna get C
C	C
A	you can't choose it's got to be random
B	chocolate chocolate cake
A	chocolate cake and crisps would be
C	chocolate cake
B	or cake
A	yeah
B	mum
A	well
B	we can get anything with chocolate
A	well it depends if we set ourself an extra challenge we could say that it has to be you know the first name that appears so we might not allow brands
A	like for K we could go ketchup could have ketchup or we could say no it's tomato ketchup so it would have to be or it says Heinz tomato ketchup so that would be an H
C	oh
A	so it depends how strict we want to be about it
C	not very strict
B	if you get Haribo you can get H
C	oh yeah H
A	Haribo or sweets you see okay
A	mm
B	if we get sweets we can choose anything
C	right I'm gonna
A	uhu M would be good
C	why?
A	marshmallows
B	money
C	money
A	you don't get money in a
A	Maltesers and Mars Bars and all that kind of thing but mainly marshmallows at the Alice in Wonderland party they had lots of tables strewn with marshmallows and Liquorice Allsorts and things
C	I hate Liquorice Allsorts
A	mm but they looked pretty good
B	may I see them?
A	I don't think I took a very good photograph but I'm sure there will be ones that the professional people took
C	must have been a rich party
A	well no we all paid to get in so about well I got mine ages ago but about thirty pounds
C	thirty pounds?
A	three O thirty pounds
C	yes
A	and on the door it's thirty-five pounds so there were probably two hundred people there
B	it's called a
A	I wonder what two hundred times thirty-five is
B	is that er erm
A	or that's two hundred times thirty
B	two what's two hundred? two zero zero?
A	mm
A	sorry?
C	it's six hundred
A	hang on a minute no it isn't
C	yeah it is
A	what is thirty times ten?
C	three hundred
A	so then you add so if it was thirty times a hundred you would add another nought so that's three thousand
C	three thousand?
A	so no no but it's actually times two hundred so it would be six thousand pounds
B	wow
C	wow
A	but they've obviously paid for the venue which I know is very expensive cos the right so they went in the
A	the bar staff
C	the bar staff?
A	people looking after a bar
C	oh I thought you meant as in a electrical bar
A	what's an electrical bar?
A	well then you didn't think that did you?
C	well I did
A	so they would have obviously made profit that's very important
C	could have
A	to not to spend the same much amount of money that you get in cos that's a bad way of doing business
C	yeah they probably charged like is that why they charged thirty-five instead of plain old thirty?
A	well they charged twenty-eight
C	twenty-eight?
A	for people that booked early like me
C	and
A	and thirty pounds for most people and then thirty-five on the door
C	ah
A	buy there like clothes and there was a
C	named Bob
A	with a sort of erm no not named Bob
A	with a chair
A	to take nice photographs so
C	and what was his name?
A	it was a woman actually I don't know what her name was
C	well then it could be Bob
A	but
A	photographs but she hasn't sent it yet yeah?
C	she proved a point
A	you've proved nothing because you've only half eaten those strawberries and you will eat the rest of those strawberries
B	I don't like the white bits
A	yeah but you haven't eaten all of the red bits have you by a long way
A	is that a made up song?
A	how
C	one
A	one one
A	one piece? do do you have any homework left?
B	my maths
A	yeah? your maths
C	yeah
B	this strawberries actually very tasteless
A	tasteless?
B	tasteless
A	you're still gonna eat it no they're not tasteless because they're from
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	sorry? they're fine
C	mm erm
A	so you didn't have any
C	cos I hadn't put them on the plate properly
A	because you always do that and I I literally am hoovering every single day at the moment
C	yeah
A	and it's really irritating and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start making you hoover underneath your table and wipe the table every day don't have any more biscuits thank you
C	no I've just got it out shall I and I'm not gonna put it on the biscuit crusher
A	you are going to eat it thank you and then you are going to have no more biscuits get it out of that clip thing please
C	I already know what it's like to crush it
A	give me the clip you are not allowed to use that for anything other than sealing the bag do you understand?
C	uhu
A	mm
B	why is it even there?
A	to keep the bag closed so if you didn't what would you think would happen to the biscuits?
B	they'll rot
C	the biscuits would escape and then become become free
A	no no nor will they rot what other
A	no cos it's in a cupboard what happens to things when so it's in a very sealed bag and then you open it and oxygen air gets into it what can happen?
C	you can eat it in space and not die
A	they go soft
C	oh it's not so
A	so that's why it's not very nice
C	why do they not become nice?
A	because they're those biscuits are crunchy and if they go really soggy and just squidgy it's not very nice is it?
C	mm
A	it's not what you want them to be so that's why you
C	I'm gonna get some trousers on
A	hurry up then
C	I'm also going to the bathroom
A	thank you
A	hurry up
B	what did he
A	I don't know
C	do the
B	oh that
