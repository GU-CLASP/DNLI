C	it's a
A	a snapshot?
C	it's a video camera but it it Gopro's are designed for like extreme sports so like snowboarders sometimes attach them to like their helmets or
A	mm
C	or or skiers or
A	I wonder how long it it films for though that?

A	you don't want to be cycling and have an upset tummy do you?
B	blooming heck
A	not a good idea Mr Gopro
