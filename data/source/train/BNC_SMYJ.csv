A	er yeah I mean the one thing is that I've actually already submitted what I was gonna do
B	oh
A	cos you had to and I thought that was like there's no real way they can force me to do them I reckon
B	no
A	erm
B	so you submitted what?
A	well that so well what I submitted was
B	I can't believe you're in your final year next year
A	two literature papers
B	what do you do in those literature papers?
A	well the options aren't that good that's the thing for the literature erm I chose The Odyssey which is the it's just about The Odyssey
B	how fantastic
A	er and the Metamorphoses
B	how fantastic
A	by Ovid
B	what's sort what sort of writing?
A	cos they're very they're very sort of like
B	well you mean that's why you chose them or that's why they're boring?
A	well they're I mean they're not boring obviously but they're not erm
B	I just think to do
A	yeah yeah
B	an in-depth paper
A	and to read the whole thing in
[ANNOTATION]	they are not boring	Entailment
B	will just be
A	and then the other thing I picked was a was a thesis
B	so that you select your own?
A	yeah
B	and just write a long paper how long is it?
A	ten thousand
[ANNOTATION]	the thesis is chosen by the teacher	Contradiction
B	really? as many as ten thousand?
A	yeah
B	I
A	yeah so do I but I don't know what the
[ANNOTATION]	the word limit cab be negotiated	Neutral
B	why don't you do?
A	see that's the problem er but
B	why don't you do?
A	but
B	James why don't you do Ulysses and Ulysses? or is that always is that a common one?
A	no but but that's too much overlap of my other paper if you see what I'm saying
B	yeah
A	erm
B	but presumably somebody tutors you for that?
A	yeah
B	you know
B	so you
[ANNOTATION]	few people wrote about Ulysses and Ulysses	Contradiction
A	yeah you do
B	you
A	and you've got
B	discuss with
A	before you get a tutor
[ANNOTATION]	tutors can help with papers	Entailment
B	with goldilocks
A	though you pick something
B	those what?
A	if I do those options
B	yeah
A	means I don't do philosophy
B	what? oh
A	well I would I think I would like to do it so they're not what I thought was that I would do a dissertation about Plato
B	what and dissertation is not the same as thesis?
A	I mean it er yeah it's the same thing but then I thought I would do one
B	oh that is quite a good idea
A	then I thought I would do one about mm sort of Plato but taking it from a literature
B	well if you've got
A	point of view
B	ten thousand words you have got quite a lot of
A	so I could so something like erm
B	I think you should do that I think it's a
A	well I had this one idea about katabasis which is going into the
B	so glad you did this subject isn't it so fantastic?
A	yeah but but then what I was thinking the other day is that I'll just do the Plato module
B	right
A	and do a do do a thesis about the more about literature
B	oh I see that is quite fine-tuning of
A	cos the thing about
B	I think well look
A	but the but the problem is
B	but
A	I need to start working now
B	yeah but it doesn't
A	yeah but the one
B	pure literary subject
A	the thing is I had an ideas for literature was about
A	Cavafy
A	Cavafy or that's the
B	yeah
A	yeah and like his
B	erm yeah and I saw you've been reading Mendelsohn's translations new translations
A	so then that's the thing so if I did a philosophy paper
B	no I think you're too literary I think you'd have to do
A	and also my teacher who I really like is the course director of that at and I he's think he's I think he's really good
B	yeah so okay so those decisions are firm and the it's just a you were just working
A	so basically what I'm definitely going to do is the Metamorphoses the the being human
B	being human as in
A	that's the X paper
B	right
A	and then either
B	thesis?
A	and Odyssey or a thesis and Plato
B	thesis and Odyssey
A	erm Metamorphoses Odyssey
B	on the imagination
A	let's have a look at that
B	I looked at it not that long ago well
A	I don't really know him
A	that's as far back I know about the sublime
B	yeah I did him Plotinus and I don't know about the Pseudo
A	well that's probably because since you did it he's become disputed
B	oh right
B	Longinus I used to call him Longinus Plotinus er and I went then I started doing
A	yeah
B	I can't remember anything about them now
A	I don't I went through an entire er school without reading any Wordsworth
B	yeah
A	did Coleridge
B	are exciting
A	oh man I just er really er am really er indecided undecided
B	you really are undecided? yeah but the thing is
A	I know but I mean part of the thing is like if you do The Odyssey you're supposed to have read The Odyssey by the time you get there
B	well you're going
A	are you
B	read it I'm gonna read I'll read it with you
A	in Greek
B	I've never read it
A	well in Greek?
B	well obviously I'm not gonna read it in Greek but
A	yeah but do you know slow do you know how long it takes to read something in Greek?
A	yeah
B	I bought the Daily Express just because it I dunno
A	you're going to
B	is it up here? oh eleven totally was just dreaming
A	yeah what am I gonna do when I finish
B	erm
A	I dunno
B	have you had any you must be
A	I thought I'd take a gap year
B	yeah take a gap year
A	what would I do during that?
B	yeah you're gonna have to earn some money that's for sure
A	I don't need very much though
B	erm
A	tutor Latin or something like that
B	well
A	I dunno really
B	tutor Latin well yeah you definitely would be able to do that
A	cos I could like
B	what were you gonna say?
A	you can do lots of little jobs and get a bit of money and tutor Latin erm
B	yeah
A	I don't know about where
B	well you could definitely go the
A	what would that actually involve doing?
B	fuck all
A	yeah
B	erm the
A	what would do they ask you like what what books do you like?
B	erm
A	yes
B	erm
A	see I a thing I thought about doing it and that would be to do a
B	oh yeah
A	and then actually
B	you can hardly speak English
A	and do like three months trying to learn
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	are you is your relationship with
A	well erm not at not at the moment
B	is she?
A	maybe I'll see what courses they have for that
B	at the
A	er no at the British School of Athens or American School of Athens and then we could look
B	I definitely think you should see what your options are academically and you know you can get all sorts of scholarships like a Fulbright and that kind of thing
A	I'm not that clever though
B	well neither were they
A	but part of the reason part of the reason for erm waiting to
B	well you can this is the kind of thing that you must discuss with your supervisors
A	well that's what my supervisor said when I suggested that
B	oh
A	I want to do that he said that would be a good idea
B	oh really?
A	because of this and this and this
B	really?
A	but he did say to me that I should definitely be thinking about doing the
B	yeah I
A	and when I mentioned America he said there's only two good places
B	yeah you told me yeah but remind me
A	Princeton
B	oh really? that would be a laugh Princeton you'd have to live in New York
A	yeah
B	my friend
A	at New Jersey?
B	in no in
B	erm Tompkins Square New York
A	how did she get that?
B	er she got it through some
A	oh yeah yeah
B	er where hang on where am I going? hang on darling erm
B	I did actually have a chat with a classicist at with the main classics guy at Princeton
A	yeah it's
B	yeah yeah it's yeah something to do with her
A	he told me to go to
B	yeah
B	well
A	but that's why he like my teacher said like funding is a lot less competitive in America because there is so much more money
B	yeah there's a lot more money yeah
A	but that's what I but that's what I er it seems like that to me something the people who
B	well it's like I don't think it's like that in your subjects
A	I but I think it's like that at
B	oh yeah of course
A	no but because it
B	is utterly parochial
A	but also it it's just because people were this is what the people who are actually more interesting are someone who
B	who's the they?
A	this hypothetical person
B	yeah
A	I mean what I'm saying is people who go on whose thing hasn't always been being good at school who have actually discovered a subject are
B	erm
A	no
B	it was a sunny day and I hadn't really been round
A	yeah
B	whereas
A	yeah yeah I can't really get out of

A	I know I went there with
A	yes yeah

[ANNOTATION]	Person B believe that the gap is useful for him	Contradiction
A	well it's still a fucking bombsite
B	so it's impossible to tell
A	yeah
B	say that again
A	I guess they have money so they didn't buy a house in
B	I don't understand why they didn't if they had money
[ANNOTATION]	Person B could not understand why when they had money didn't use it	Neutral
A	I thought the whole plan was they would sell their house and buy one in
B	and they haven't bought a house?
A	that at some point they decided not to buy a house in
B	and how often are they going to be in
A	erm
B	and what happens to their house when they're not there?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is worried that when the house were empty what happened to it	Entailment

B	why don't you want to stay in there? they're not there
A	I don't know I just don't I just don't want to
[ANNOTATION]	Person A dont like to stay in that house	Neutral
B	that's what
A	right you you know what you could why don't you rent your house out
B	what two of your friends?
B	you think I'm gonna fucking rent my house to
A	I mean er just for an example
B	no it would be like renting my house out to students they wouldn't they would
A	they're not it's
B	it would be trashed
B	where is
A	I'm not actually sure she's been she's been in Miami a lot
B	what's she been doing in Miami?
A	I think she has a boyfriend there
B	how is she earning any money?
A	she's er a hostess there at a hotel
B	what?
A	she works as a hostess at a hotel
B	what hotel?
B	erm it's an idea
A	erm
B	what if it was just one of them?
A	I reckon you could charge six hundred and seven hundred for the big one for
B	so for example next
A	it's hard to rent out one room though cos there would
B	well they're not empty are they because you and
A	I mean the problem with me is I don't actually rent my room all year round
B	I know
A	what about your job?

A	eight hundred thousand?
B	have another guess
A	a million?
B	have another guess
A	one point two million?
B	one point two five million
A	that's totally insane I don't
B	totally insane
A	makes me feel sick
B	erm it makes me feel really rich
A	so you're thinking what you could get somewhere and if you then rent out to
B	well
A	but his house must be worth like fucking forty-five mill then
B	his house is worth two two point one
A	I don't think that you could sell that house for that much money
B	well I must admit I don't really think so either but that's
A	and they say I saw this article and it's just like
B	I know
A	just here it's like party time man
B	no I know but the
A	yeah
B	amount of money
A	but it hasn't
B	no they've sold it
A	they've sold it
B	they have now sold it so she'll be and that was one point two five
B	I know
A	it's gonna be so horrible to live there in five years in that area don't you think?

B	that's such a New York thing to do isn't it? go out to eat in a restaurant instead of
A	well they've got I to be I guess they can't use their house cos it's
B	oh I see
A	a building site it's like
B	and
A	I don't know why you'd go to that restaurant when you could go to so much better ones
B	how is
A	she's
B	quite old now
B	incredibly boring?
A	you know whether she should send
B	beg your pardon?
A	talking about school to send

A	cos we could come then I'd like to see it
B	yeah you should we would like you to see it erm
A	well I'm definitely going to Greece
B	when are you going to Greece?
A	I haven't booked it but probably in September it's cheaper emptier and nicer
B	yeah you don't wanna go there go in August basically the the real problem is you don't want to go anywhere in August apart from
A	yeah
B	Scotland
A	yeah it's true
B	erm
A	why don't you get a house in Scotland?
B	well we might do that too
A	that would be good you should do that

A	yeah I'll send him a message later
B	have you got his number?
A	I don't think I do
B	what the fuck is happening here?
A	I don't really use Facebook
B	well you might have to get on it in order to be in touch with him or he's gone to Switzerland so I don't particularly want to text him for his number
A	can't wait for the day when people are not on Facebook and you don't have to go on it
B	well obviously that's my every day
B	but there will come
A	yeah
B	a time won't there?
A	yeah
B	I mean it's just but won't it be replaced by something else?
A	yeah but something not so sort of something more like Instagram or Twitter
B	so you think you were well lols when you put that on
B	at the
A	what's the
B	the
A	when's he going to be able to eat again?
B	I think he'll never be able to eat erm I think pasta and bread that's it
A	or maybe you've got to go to that place in Tuscany and have the goose pasta
B	oh you she was fucking last thing that
B	probably spontaneously combust
B	he can't even
A	I mean we got me and
B	have you?
A	yeah
B	what do you mean invited? what does that mean?
A	come and stay and eat for free cos they're the the woman loves
B	ah
A	I don't know don't know how big it was or anything
B	it was fucking big I couldn't carry it it needed two people to carry it
A	yeah
B	worry about that cos I go to your special little parking place
A	but yeah today is definitely the day that people get picked up
B	so what is the outcome? is
A	I think a state school
B	a state school? oh how
A	oh I dunno
B	that's amazing amazing
A	yeah
B	that's pretty impressive
A	well I think that's what he was waiting for but it was
B	it looked like she was never gonna pop her clogs how long does he have to wait? yeah I agree
B	no it was mistake to not buy some in the petrol station but I was so bamboozled by paying first I couldn't kind of
A	I dunno I've never seen any of this before
B	no it's
B	we've been
A	I doubt it
B	well it's cos of all those
A	I've never seen this before it looks quite nice
B	oh no I think I know where we are
A	I yeah I know where we are but it's not exactly close to where we need to be
B	well look this is all I was doing was following the road
A	yeah we didn't you have to come in a week otherwise it's a total nightmare we can still do that in the summer but it's not
B	did you have er you know what was your last you didn't have
A	it's we've been to that that's the pub we went to with
B	it's all been dug up and it's all different isn't it?
A	yeah you should see what they're doing by the station I must say it looks totally skyscrapers
B	they just keep trying to build skyscrapers in the village in
B	erm there's been programmes on the radio about it I mean there's the development and the building they're trying to pretend er throughout the whole of Britain that they're trying to pretend that it's because we need houses but it isn't because there are plenty of
A	yeah I mean the reason why they're doing that massive development by the station and is because it's only forty-five minutes away from Kings Cross so it's like a borough of London
B	no
A	I went there with
B	did you? I don't know where the fuck to go
A	yeah
B	take that away put me somewhere where I can I think I'll go
A	mm
B	isn't that your college down there?
A	no
B	what college is that?
A	that's
A	yeah follow the sign
B	diverted
A	yeah they all look like student student houses
B	yeah it's fun being a student even if you're having a terrible time
B	right
A	yeah keep following the diverted traffic I reckon
B	erm nothing very much erm I've been trying to get him a pair of trousers but he needed to try them on
A	yeah I've been the
B	oh god misery
A	yeah I suppose so
B	I think that would be a good thing to do so it'll have to be
A	when's
A	yeah
B	where is that for?
A	that road
B	okay
A	why don't you do a U though?
B	where are these are these people queueing to park?
A	does this say diverted traffic? no what is that sign?
B	they're going into the car park but I don't want to go into the car park
A	do turn around
B	can I just
A	that's a pub I know lots of people who go to that pub
B	how could this be diverted traffic?
A	I dunno I
B	fantastic
A	probably yeah
B	yeah almshouses I imagine they are right
A	what's an almshouse?
B	almshouses are houses that were built by the church for erm old people
A	do they
B	no
A	well they should be
B	it was a sort of movement in in the nineteenth century in fact quite until I don't know very much about it and until quite far up into the erm twentieth century
A	thing is now we are like deep in one way
