A	mm
B	do you watch The Secret Life of Dogs?
A	yeah
B	have you been?
A	yeah I've been watching that
C	no I should watch that
B	I I should be recording or set it to come on but I tend to just sort of catch it part way in
C	mm
B	and the first one I saw they were talking about overweight dogs
C	mm
A	yeah
B	and they er invited owners into
A	mm
C	mm
B	and this was all dry food and over eighty percent of owners weighed out too much or or they served up too much food
C	mm
B	only about two out of twenty used a
A	mm
C	mm
B	or a receptacle that
C	mm
B	is the right
C	mm
B	weight for her
A	mm
B	but over eighty percent overfed and some of them you could see them they would sort of put some in look at it and go
C	mm
B	oh put a bit more in
A	mm
B	and they what they do is they set up cameras in people's homes erm or or the environment the dog is in and sometimes it's about behaviours this time it was just about obese dogs
C	mm
B	as I said and er there was this little I think it was a King Charles spaniel or something quite little and he was a barrel
B	and she said they are very careful they weigh his food out and he'll walk away from it in the evenings very often but what they didn't what the lady didn't realise her elderly mother lives with them
C	oh no
B	and she would sit in the living room with a tray
A	mm
B	and the family would sit in the in the kitchen or on the dining room so the dog
C	oh no
B	and er they they run a pub
A	mm
B	so in the evenings the dog would be down in the pub as well and they
C	oh no
A	mm
B	throwing pork scratchings
B	and they were sliding them along the floor and the dog was hurtling along so it's er
A	mm
B	they said it's actually getting some exercise
A	mm
B	so it's better than just feeding it so it's getting some exercise
B	but it would go through two packets of pork scratchings a night
C	oh no
B	and then eventually cos it kept looking at it's dinner going mm that's not pork scratchings
A	no
B	but eventually it would come back to it and it would eat all that on top of everything else
A	mm
B	and the poor woman was absolutely horrified
B	that er everybody else was feeding this dog
C	I think dogs are like that aren't they? cos they'll just eat whatever's in front of em won't they? or I always I don't really know that much about dogs but say you like
B	some breeds
C	some breeds will
B	will will eat
C	mm
A	mm
C	mm
B	our dog she tends to she's got she's got OCD as well it doesn't matter how full her bowl is
A	yeah
B	it's like you cut it in half she will eat half of it
C	mm
B	but she'll eat half of it down to the bottom of the bowl and it's
B	it's like a solid wall of food and then the other half the bowl is full
C	yeah
B	and she she never eats more and she rarely eats less it's half the bowl you can see she's
B	measured it out she's gone right that's it and then she'll go back to the rest of it later but later could be four or five hours later even
C	oh see my
B	but there's nobody else in the house that will eat it she knows that
C	oh yeah so she knows it's safe
A	mm
B	but the cat will go and have a little look
C	yeah
B	but the cat and the dog share the same water bowl
C	yeah
B	but the the the biscuits are too big for our cat to eat
A	mm
B	so yeah she's never
C	yeah that it might be eaten
A	mm
C	see my mother-in-law's dog won't eat in front of you like if you put her food out you have to go out the room
C	she'll only eat or she'll take it and she'll go in the corner and she'll eat herself dogs are weird
A	strange
C	yeah
A	mm
C	dogs are strange
C	mm
B	it's got a erm er a washable floor but where the dining room part is it's it's carpet
C	mm
B	so she'll she'll her food is on the
C	mm
B	on the hard surface so she'll go and get a mouthful carry it over to the carpet put it all down on the carpet and then pick it up off there
C	oh
B	and I don't know why I don't know why she does it
A	strange mm
B	there's no rhyme or reason unless she just doesn't like standing on that floor
A	could be mm
C	oh animals
A	have you seen any any of the erm Super Senses of animals?
C	no
B	no
C	what's that about?
A	it's erm they they do a sense each time so the first one was on
B	mm
A	erm and er it was really interesting they started showing how how we see things cos light bounces off it
C	mm
B	mm
A	and obviously if it's a prism or the rainbow
B	mm
A	you can see all the different colours
C	mm
A	and how different animals use different layers of the spectrum of the colours to actually enable them to hunt and and survive
C	mm
A	erm and it went right through to infrared where where er a snake erm which was some sort of bat-eating snake it was called or something erm but it used to be in the caves with the bats and it actually used infrared
C	ah
A	so it could see the heat
C	mm
A	with the with the animals
C	that's amazing
B	mm
A	and the other end of the spectrum was the erm
C	uhu
A	that sort of and and it was showing the the animals that used that and
C	mm
A	and how
B	mm
A	in slow motion and how this is why you can never sort of
C	yeah
B	mm
A	all that sort of stuff
B	cos don't dogs just see in shades of grey?
C	I have heard that er yeah actually
B	they don't see colour
A	mm
C	yeah they only see black and white yeah
A	mm I think I've heard that as well
C	mm
B	erm
A	oh no it was really interesting
B	why is it with cats you can put a piece of cheese down in front of them or a bit of ham or something
A	mm
B	and and they don't see it but they can spot a a bird or a mouse?
C	yeah
B	I I don't know if they're just terribly short-sighted
A	mm
C	I remember when
A	mm
C	it's not that long is it? maybe six weeks or something or
B	mm
A	mm
C	I was like really? he can only see black and white? it was just
A	mm
C	amazing
A	and er the second one of the senses was on erm
B	mm
A	but I haven't watched that yet it's on the planner but it's really interesting and then there's there's a third one which I don't know whether it'll be on smell or touch
B	mm
A	mm
C	I'll have to what channel's that on?
A	erm I don't know
A	mm you know sort of I think it's maybe er BBC two or something like that
C	yeah
A	mm sort of
B	mm
C	oh yeah I'll have to it'll probably be on Iplayer
A	it is really interesting
C	yeah it does sound it
A	mm
C	the sort of thing I'd quite like
B	I do like a bit of BBC
A	mm
B	I keep saying these days I really don't think we get anything out of satellite
A	no
A	mm
B	but we don't watch movies
C	oh
B	er we between us we've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of DVDs
A	mm
B	we don't watch
C	we're the same I mean especially the films like I think erm I dunno it's like there never seems to be anything but you know like on the Box Office there's always loads of good films isn't there?
A	mm
C	but there's never anything actually on the on the actual ones
B	no
C	we watch erm cos we've got Amazon Prime I think it was Lovefilm but now it's just called Amazon Prime Instant
A	mm
C	that's quite good actually cos it's got all of
A	mm
C	like thinking of things I've got to do
A	mm
B	I can't just sit and watch TV
C	mm I can't
B	if I do I fall asleep
C	mm
B	at at seven o'clock in the evening eight o'clock in the evening
C	mm
B	whereas if I'm doing something cos I do tea cosies and
C	oh yeah
B	I've started doing I mean
C	mm
B	if you knit or crochet a blanket and attached to the middle of it is a little toy
C	yes I saw those actually in
B	so I've I've started doing those
C	ah
B	and I can do one in an evening
C	yeah
A	mm
B	if I set my mind to it
A	mm
B	but I can't just watch television
C	yeah
B	my mind's like you say my mind wanders
C	I can't concentrate
B	I fall asleep and if
C	yeah
B	you choose and I'll say what's the point I'll be asleep in ten minutes
C	yeah
B	you
A	mm
B	watch something that you wanna see through to the end
C	oh I'm the same it frustrates
B	mm
C	and I'm like well no cos I just get all I'll just go and do so and so
B	mm
C	or I'll do this or I'll do that at the same time and
A	yeah
C	oh
A	he just falls asleep
C	there's something about the TV isn't there?
A	mm
B	mm
C	being on the sofa and being all cosy
B	mm
C	er what was I gonna say? oh a lady at work she's quite into knitting and crocheting she brought in erm
B	mm
A	mm
C	so she's gonna make a few bits stockings and I think there was a snowman doorstop and cos I love I'm all over anything like that
B	oh nice
A	mm
C	anything kind of decorating the house
B	you should learn
C	I would like to I would like to cos my mum always used to be able to knit and crochet but I don't think I've got the patience or the kind of I dunno like is it the coordination almost? or
A	mm dexterity
B	if you crochet though you can do it literally in five minutes
C	yeah dexterity that's the word yeah
B	I've just got a big erm like a a jute bag
C	mm
B	and I just keep my whatever I'm working on at the moment
C	yeah
B	in there and you can keep the wool in there so you literally just
C	yeah
B	working with what what you can hold in your hand
C	mm
B	and if you need to put it away put it down you just put it back in the bag and it's it's all in there you don't have to
C	mm
B	you know make any clear any er any area or anything or
C	I've heard it's very therapeutic and like people say it's
B	and it's very trendy these days
C	do you know? I know so many people who are into knitting now
A	mm
B	mm
C	there's a knitting club
B	I started up I've started up a knit and natter club at work
A	have you?
C	I was just about to say a knitting club yeah
B	Thursday lunchtimes erm and and it was a case of a couple of people wanted to know one of them was my daughter I think we started three four weeks ago and I just showed them on the first one how to do basic stitches and how to do a granny square
A	mm
B	and everybody wants to
C	yeah
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	so she worked out she needed two hundred and eighty-four squares and she'd got to about seventy
C	wow
B	and
A	mm
B	or she'll come to mine we try and work it on a Wednesday so we can watch Great British Bake Off as well
A	yeah yeah
B	and she says to me mum I'm not even twenty and I'm turning into an old lady
C	oh and it's quite popular now though
A	yeah
C	I think it's got a revival like baking as well though like cos the Bake Off I think
A	mm oh yeah did you watch it last night?
B	mm
C	yeah it was good
A	mm I was out last night when I got in and I watched it when I got in
C	they amaze me some of the stuff they do though
A	yeah
C	it's like
B	mm
A	yeah
C	cos I I can make cakes but they never look pretty
A	mm
C	and the way that they just
B	it's of the scale isn't it?
C	just nail yeah
A	mm
C	but that erm
A	no I watched it
C	oh you did watch it? sorry oh I thought you said you didn't watch it
A	yeah that's no I watched it after I got in
C	oh sorry
A	mm oh yeah I couldn't wait till today
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	princess cake yeah
C	oh that looked amazing didn't it?
A	yeah
C	I was like oh
A	mm
C	that looks really good
B	but when you see some of the fantastic results they all have had
C	yeah
B	and then when they did that princess cake only two of them turned out didn't they?
C	mm
A	yeah
B	and the others
A	yeah
B	looked a right
C	mm
B	hash
A	mm yeah
B	probably a lot better than mine would've turned out
B	but still and you
C	yeah
B	and it it just makes you appreciate the fact that they are erm amateurs
A	yeah
B	they're only doing it cos they love doing it
C	yeah
A	that's what that erm Nancy said didn't she? she said with something like that
C	I like her
A	she said it's if you've got the basics if you've got the skills
B	mm
A	and you can just do them
C	yeah
A	and that's what she was saying oh you need to
B	mm
C	mm
A	she knows what you need to do for that and she knows when you need to prove it and how long and
C	yeah
A	which so she's a really good solid baker
C	yeah
A	with a bit of flair as well
C	I think she's good
B	yeah
A	mm
C	I I think she might
A	yeah I like her
C	I think she might I like her
A	I think she might
C	but that girl the little baby
A	Martha
C	yeah
B	mm
A	oh oh I love her
C	I know she's oh my god
B	she's doing her A levels
C	doing her A levels
A	mm yeah she took two exams the following week and she's like going well I'm
C	she's amazing
A	oh
B	one something that she did didn't turn out very well at all and she got and and er I like the fact that the judges are no less harsh on her just because she's seventeen
A	mm
C	yeah she's young yeah
A	yeah
B	and the others but she was actually crying
A	I know she was outside in tears and she was saying I know it's silly but I'm not but and they've just said it's not very good and
B	mm
A	and then the next one the next thing she did in the next round was just amazing again wasn't it?
C	yeah
A	and you think well yeah bless her
C	she's definitely
A	can you pass the sauce?
C	oh yeah of course
A	thanks mm
C	she's definitely like a natural talent isn't she like?
A	she's only oh yeah yeah but when she started doing all the different things with the erm
B	mm
A	so er she must've had that
C	oh yeah yeah
A	the right life you know growing up with the
B	mm
C	oh yeah yeah
A	with skiing and this and that and the other when she did all that and it's sort of like oh well I've had this with the chalet thingy and
B	biscuit chalet
A	mm yeah yeah some of the stuff she does
B	and it always er amazes me when perhaps it mm perhaps it's wrong of me to say so but when big hairy fellas
B	produce these
C	yeah
B	such delicate pieces of work
A	mm
C	it's amazing that one that was always a pencil behind his ear with
B	the
C	yeah something like that yeah
B	yeah he's always got a pencil
C	yeah
B	I think he went out last week
A	Norman?
C	oh did he?
A	yeah Norman went last week
B	mm
C	oh I think of another name
B	there's Luis
A	there's Luis who is the old guy who's very technical does amazing
C	Luis Luis that's it not Norman
A	yeah
B	he's got real OCD hasn't he?
C	mm
B	as well I think he said
A	has he?
B	yeah yeah so
A	oh
B	everything has to be
A	mm
B	his his design for the er what did he call it? the tower no
A	the the tower on the no the
B	on the hill or
A	cave on erm castle on the rock oh ah yeah
B	something like that
A	er the one that did yeah I know the one you mean
B	with all the caramel
unknown	mm
B	when he showed them his design it was almost like er a erm
A	technical drawing mm
B	a technical yeah
C	yeah
B	a technical drawing
A	mm
B	so precise
C	oh I have to admit those erm
B	mm
A	mm
C	those cakes looked amazing didn't they?
A	mm
C	all those layers oh you could so just looked so good
B	I've always wanted to do a it's
C	yeah
A	mm
C	I think that's what it's called yeah
B	cos I had er a cookery book and it was one of the main pictures in it you know
C	oh yeah yeah
A	mm
B	you get a big page and I've always fancied doing that and thought no I can't make caramel
B	mm but I'm er I'm sure you know if you set your mind to it
A	it's getting it the right temperature isn't it?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and then working it and using it then
B	mm
C	yeah I wouldn't even know where to start on anything like that
A	no
C	I'd like to though maybe I'll like make a croque-en-bouche for next book club or something?
B	mm
A	mm
A	that was erm
C	this
[ANNOTATION]	C is thinking about making a croque-en-bouche, that is, a tower of profiteroles, for the next book club.	Entailment
C	I'm struggling with a croque-en-bouche
A	that was erm Australian Masterchef wasn't it? they always used to do
C	oh did they? was it?
A	when er towards the end
C	yeah
A	and they used to bring somebody in they'd go right and then they'd er and it almost always was a croque-en-bouche
C	en-bouche
A	and they'd all go oh
A	and spinning all the sugar
B	I watched that on one occasion
A	mm
B	and they were I think they were shucking oysters is it shucking? it is isn't it? when you open an oyster you
A	don't know
[ANNOTATION]	There is no Masterchef in Australia.	Contradiction
C	mm don't like oysters
B	and you shuck it er oysters and they had king big king prawns and it was they had erm professionals that literally spend all day doing this and then record holders for how many er they can do in a certain amount of time and they were just
A	mm
B	once they'd picked from the point of pricking it
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Some people spend all day preparing seafood.	Entailment
B	and it was just this movement like this
A	mm
B	er you know what it's like when you try and peel a prawn yourself?
C	yeah
B	it's so fiddly
C	yeah
B	and they were just
B	thinking oh I I can't do that that quickly
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	B won't shut up about oysters and prawns.	Entailment
B	mm
A	just cos er I happened to be flicking through and it was the first one as a coincidence when I started watching it
C	yeah
A	and I watched that series but apart from that erm one the other time I've gone in I've not been interested in it cos I think er it's it's very much like with the
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They don't like oysters.	Entailment
B	yeah
C	it's the characters yeah
B	yeah
A	mm same with America's Next Top Model and all those sort of things if you start watching any any of those things
B	mm
C	yeah
A	you need to watch them sort of from the
C	oh definitely yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A things you should watch these programs from the beginning.	Entailment
B	yeah
C	yeah no I've kind of given up with Next Top Model cos I did start watching it
A	mm
C	and now I've just thought oh I think
A	no
C	it's been going for so long now
A	I haven't watched it for years
B	don't think I've ever watched it
A	but this year it's men and women in it
C	oh just as well yeah that's why
B	oh really?
A	mm and
C	oh okay
A	and then social media all these photos are put up and er at the end social media have a vote to put one person back in
C	yeah
B	oh
A	whether it's for the final or mm
C	oh that's good
A	yeah
C	cos that sort of cos the format is a bit old now isn't it?
A	mm the thing I enjoy most about that is the er is the photographs when they do the photo shoot
C	yeah and we see em at the end yeah
A	and do that so here's the when they're actually taking the photographs
C	mm
A	and then this is the photo that they've
C	mm
A	they've got from it erm I just cos for me I think it's cause and effect I like
C	yeah
A	you see something happening and that's what the result is
C	yeah
A	and that's the bit I enjoy and I can just literally just watch that bit out of any of them and be quite happy just to watch that
C	yeah
B	and are they into touching up the photos and airbrushing that sort of thing?
A	no well no I don't no they don't they just it's just as they are isn't it?
C	yeah I think it's as they are I quite like when you see like these girls who obviously they're really skinny and tall but I just look at them like you're not actually that pretty
A	no
C	and then you they photograph
B	mm
C	and the way they do em and they just look
A	yeah
C	a hundred dollar a hundred million dollars
A	mm
C	and the way they can just
B	sensational
C	yeah it's quite interesting
A	well a lot of it is is how you stand and
C	yeah
A	and like elongating parts and
C	how you can hold yourself and yeah
A	reflecting the light off your face
C	there is more to it
A	she says turning her light to the
C	the face to the light yeah
A	the face to the light above her
A	yeah mm no
C	yeah
A	but at the beginning the first couple of them she'll be saying she'll be going she certainly needs a makeover what are they gonna do with her? are they gonna make it
C	oh yeah I like that one though when they cut their hair
A	and do this yeah
C	in that episode when they cut all their hair that's always there was er
A	mm there's always the ones that are crying and
C	yeah there's always one
A	you're cutting off my hair
C	you can't cut off my hair I'm so ugly now
C	yeah
A	no you really aren't
A	mm
C	no I do like it
A	mm ah

A	mm
B	erm and er er
A	mm
C	mm
B	it was before I knew them and they got er got flown out there they were on this show and it was it was so cringeworthy these American guys were coming on and they'd maybe only be there in a pair of jeans they were

A	so yeah
B	that's the right way to be isn't it? you don't lower your standards for somebody else

B	mm
A	et cetera and goes out with her friends and does stuff so she's busy she says you know
C	yeah
A	I don't quite know when I'd fit one in
C	yeah
A	I said well that's great
A	cos that's how it should be cos then that's
B	mm
A	when you do meet somebody but they then fit in around you
C	when you least expect it
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	when you're not on the lookout when you're not
A	no
C	that's when you always meet someone
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but she's said that said before you know she said oh she said I'm not that bothered and sometimes she goes I would quite like to be but

C	I do know
C	I do know somebody who's just turned twenty-five a guy at work
A	oh do you?
C	yeah he's very
A	mm
C	would she like a timid guy? or would you think she'd prefer somebody a bit more confident?
A	er I think she needs
C	he's not the wrestling guy someone else just so you know
A	no just another one
C	it's not the wrestling guy
B	not the weird one
A	not the weird wrestling one
B	and what and what is weird about him?
A	mm
C	he used to share a house with his brother but his brother's moved out now and I would probably say he's a little bit set in his ways
A	mm
C	cos he's lived on his own for quite a while and he's he's quite tidy and he just he probably doesn't go out that much maybe
B	but that must mean that he's got
C	but I dunno if he's looking for
A	would he would he tidy up after her?
C	I don't know if he's looking for the
B	mm
A	yeah mm
C	there's potential there
A	yeah it's funny cos she's quite chatty and bright but er she's actually really quite shy
C	yeah
B	mm
A	she had she says it's funny because you know normally when people start to get interested in each other there's a bit of a
C	mm
A	oh well I'll say so and so and I'll text
B	yeah
C	does it?
A	er well not even not so much terrifies she just doesn't enjoy it
C	mm
A	she said I just we start a bit like this she said and and I just wanna say to them look is something gonna happen? is it going somewhere?
A	cos if it is that's great let's just get on you know
C	mm
A	and go out and see what happens
B	if not
A	or if not er er cos er I don't like this
A	and or I do you just wanna be a friend? and so she's sort of almost like feels
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and she sort of goes mm I really really gets in a tizzy about it bless her but oh I'm sure it'll happen I'm I'm sure it'll happen
B	I would hate to be a teenager early twenties and setting out on the
A	mm yeah
B	journey to find a a life partner
A	mm
C	it's all different now though it's like everyone does online don't they?
A	yeah
B	that's how I met
A	mm
C	yeah but even like
A	mm
C	cos I always thought that I know people my age use
A	mm
C	online dating but I didn't think someone in their early twenties would
A	no yeah they do
C	cos I thought surely they're using the
B	yeah
C	but no
A	no no
B	no
C	it's across the board now it's everyone isn't it?
B	it is absolutely yeah
A	mm mm
C	yeah
B	and I think it's partly because some people are er nervous about meeting somebody they don't know and being with
C	yeah
B	with somebody they don't know whereas
C	yeah email and phone and
A	yeah
B	if you've got if you haven't got a weirdo on the other end
C	yeah that's the thing you have to filter
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and at least know things about them and about their character sense of humour and that sort of thing and their interests
A	mm
C	but even if you were searching like you can filter down people they always say what they're looking for don't they?
A	mm
B	yeah
C	so there's none of that kind of like if
C	if you want children
A	yeah
C	you want someone who wants children and someone that
B	yeah
C	specifically says I don't want children you're like okay
A	yeah
C	I I don't want him you know you can
B	mm
A	mm
C	get you know get to the right person
A	just like that that advert where the guy's sat there with a camel next to him
B	camel
A	on this dating website you er you you like long walks on the beach and in the sand or something on this website you'd be a match
B	and they're both the same age
A	and they're yeah it's like mm yeah
A	it's funny
B	mm
A	but I think with thing like Tinder now which I mean I'm
C	oh yeah
A	I'm not on but I think that just shows you who's in the same area doesn't it? and you can start chatting or stuff
C	I think that's more for
A	young
C	hooking up like
A	yeah that's no and that's what I was gonna
A	I was gonna say that though because
A	yeah mm
B	get an alert or something?
A	yeah she got an alert that she'd gone on that er just
C	yeah
A	I was just think er cos of that my one of my oh what is it?
B	oh my god
A	and it's just like she went oh my god
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	she had an alert on the phone	Entailment
B	no
C	oh my god
A	and it's like
C	yeah
A	although the idea is oh well you can see who is er yeah it is
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	you can see their hobbies	Neutral
A	basically just a
A	yeah
C	knowing that people can see exactly where you are
B	mm
A	you can switch your location services off they can't
C	oh oh can you?
A	well not on Tinder
C	not on Tinder
A	I don't know on Tinder the whole point of Tinder is I think is that
C	yeah you can yeah
A	yeah it's who's there but
C	yeah
A	no no I mean generally it's like when everything's posted on Facebook now and it says where you are when you post it so
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Tinder doesn't show the user's location	Contradiction
C	yeah yeah
A	but you can switch that off as well can't you?
C	you can turn it off yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the location service is always on	Contradiction
B	yes yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I think it's just a lot of people don't know what you can and can't do and
C	no
A	they don't know what's happening when you've got thing like this Facebook Messenger now have you seen that now?
C	oh yes
[ANNOTATION]	Facebook posts shows where they were posted	Entailment
A	if you've got Iphone's
C	yeah
A	you have to have the Messenger it's the only way you can see messages and if you've got that it then gets access to everything
C	yeah
B	really?
A	erm and there's all the and I keep reading different bits and thinking well but you can't get off it if you want to do Messenger
B	no
C	yeah
A	and the whole thing I liked on Facebook was you had Messenger and you could be if you're on the PC you could be chatting to people or you're chatting on your phone to people
B	mm
A	at the same time as being on Facebook
C	yeah yeah
A	but now it has to go into this different app and if this other app's taking all this sort of stuff and you keep going in trying to change the settings and you think well actually it sounds like they're being a bit naughty
C	it's a little bit strange isn't it? yeah
B	cos there have been times where you know you might be a
A	mm
B	some kind of app within Facebook and you think oh yeah I'll have a look at that
A	yeah
B	and then it says to do this you need to allow
C	yeah
B	access all of your information blah and
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah and allow it to post on your behalf
B	yeah
A	and I'm like
A	what?
B	er no thank you
A	yeah
C	yeah they always say that don't they?
B	mm
A	yeah and I go no
B	mm
A	so I no I don't don't go on any of those
B	er talking of posting on your behalf have you heard about erm it's I think it's er you can set up your er Twitter account
A	mm
B	and you can sort of preprogramme messages or tweets
C	yes
B	so that if you die
C	huh oh
B	it will continue to to post tweets in your name in the style that you write
C	oh
B	I know
A	is that so people don't know you're dead? or does it say by the way I died this is what I think
B	but you but you can yeah you you can set messages
A	wow
B	so that it I'm I'm not sure how exactly how it works
A	no
C	if I have died then like maybe like I'm gonna say if I have passed away then I'd
A	mm
C	oh I dunno that's uncomfortable isn't it?
B	isn't it?
A	yeah
C	creepy as well
B	mm
A	mm
C	really strange
B	and I was reading about a lady it was mm not kind of linked I suppose reading about a lady today who is one of seven hundred and fifty people just seven hundred and fifty people
[ANNOTATION]	the lady is special	Neutral
A	mm
B	shortlisted for a one-way trip to Mars
C	oh
C	one way?
B	so it was on the BBC website yeah it would be to colonise Mars
A	mm
B	and erm
A	mm
C	how it's it takes a long time to get there though doesn't it?
B	it's about five years
C	oh is it
B	yeah yeah so five year
C	oh can you imagine five years?
B	so they'll go
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	it takes a month to travel to Mars	Contradiction
B	and stay there but not come back
A	and then not not be able to come back
B	and I'm er because it it was written
C	oh
C	yeah
B	because it said how how does it feel
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they will stay on Mars	Entailment
B	er when your wife is is down on a list for a one-way trip to Mars?
A	yeah
C	is she leaving him behind?
B	and he he said to begin with er they're American and he said to begin with he erm looked on it as her deserting him leaving him
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
B	er you know wanting to be with him at all why else would she do this? and then he said he's come to accept the fact that she wants to do it for humanity
C	humanity yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are going together	Contradiction
B	and blah blah blah and he's so proud of her and he'll always be rather than being her her being Mrs and then his name he will always be
A	yeah
B	Mr
C	to her yeah
B	and her name
A	mm
C	because that's how he wants to be remembered if she should get so the husband of this wonderful woman
[ANNOTATION]	they will be remembered	Neutral
C	wow
A	mm
B	that's er but yeah one er one in thirty-five that's
C	is she is she an astronaut then? or is she just an ordinary?
B	no no she's er er it's this is it it's erm there were I think there were
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	she plans to go alone	Entailment
C	wow
B	or twenty thousand applications and it's been shortlisted and shortlisted and shortlisted but it's all just you know Joe Public
C	oh that's mad isn't it? like
A	mm
C	I suppose are they gonna be like you know having children out there? are they gonna be expected to populate? or?
B	I don't know
A	well if they're setting up a colony yeah they're gonna have to be
C	it's like a TV show
B	so why wouldn't they be looking for couples? yeah
A	well yeah
B	you'd think they'd be looking for couples then wouldn't you?
A	yeah although with a couple you might get one person that really wants to and the other one says they'll go and actually then they'll either drop out part way through
C	mm
A	change their mind halfway there or not be wholeheartedly into it
B	yeah yeah it just seemed really bizarre
A	mm
B	I think to to go through a
A	mm
B	er who who would ever think that in our lifetime we'd be thinking about
C	yeah I know
A	mm
C	five years though blooming eck
C	you know I can't even
A	I wonder if you'll be able to do Words with Friends out there?
C	yeah
C	just a five-year journey I just can't even fathom
A	imagine getting there check-in Facebook Mars
C	yeah
B	set up new place
A	yeah
C	dunno I can't
A	yeah
C	it's just insane isn't it?
B	but would how long would it take for it to
A	mm
B	travel back though? to actually
A	yeah
B	oh oh that was five years ago
A	yeah
C	that's mad isn't it?
B	mm
A	mm
C	crazy
B	but then again erm
A	mm
C	mm mm
B	so what? forty years after that? when
A	don't know
A	I don't know
C	come on you know
C	your area of expertise
A	yeah
B	it can't have been more than about forty fifty years after that can it? was it two thousand and nine two thousand and nineteen something like that? forty fifty years I'm gonna hazard a
A	I don't know
B	two thousand and nineteen we're in two thousand and fourteen
A	I can look up I'll find out this is er an interesting fact we need to know
B	but you know you thinking of from now forty forty years' time
C	yeah what's gonna be? yeah
B	what advances are there going to be?
C	I've been reading well so the guy at work
B	there's always been yeah
C	cos no one's done it since have they? like actually walked on the moon
B	no no but then er it's you know when it's done once
C	I know yeah well true
B	er the first ones get the glory don't they?
C	yeah yeah
B	been there done that I suppose but yeah there was a lot of theories about
A	well it's not the space shuttle is it? it's the satellite we're talking about not it's alright I'm
B	the space erm
A	satellite
A	not shuttle?
B	it's erm
A	did you say shuttle? no
B	no
A	station
B	station that's the word
A	that's the word
B	space station
A	yeah it's that one
C	that telescope actually is
A	twentieth of November nineteen nineteen ninety-eight
C	so is there people who've been living there like
B	no they stay there for a while and rotate cos er
A	I think people take them up and they swap
C	oh there was a guy actually I remember maybe about a year ago there was this interview was he coming back or something?
B	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
B	cos they were watching the World Cup live up there weren't they?
A	were they?
B	yeah
A	was that when they were saying about send pictures in of you watching the World Cup to see who's watching it in the strangest place? I know one of the commentators said that
B	I
C	that's insane isn't it?
B	or or recorded
C	yeah
B	erm footage
A	mm
B	of er I can't remember was he German? or Russian? or? er and it was his team was playing
C	yeah
B	and there were two or three of them
A	ah

B	yeah
A	it's a washing machine drum on bricks
B	mm
A	which is er it's a big fire we have
B	brilliant
A	we had that and then we had a table and we got the
B	amazing
C	oh that sounds lovely
A	and the telly with the World Cup not that I was interested in the World Cup
A	but it was just the fact that we were watching in the middle of a field
B	yeah
A	round a fire
C	sounds lovely
A	mm
B	it does certainly does
A	did we ought to talk about the book?
C	do you know? we've done it again haven't we?
A	mm
C	it
B	where is it even?
C	I have it here
A	mm
C	so what did you think?
B	I really really liked it
C	shall I get my notebook?
A	yeah
B	I really liked the main character but I liked her friend what was her friend called? Mrs
C	Mrs Smiling
A	Mrs Smiling
B	that's it and I loved the way she was always referred to as Mrs Smiling there was only one or two occasions where the main character referred to her by name
A	yeah
B	and erm the the the oddball family
C	oh yeah
B	I thought was fab
B	yeah
C	but this is like the real countryside and in a way
A	mm
B	all the interbreeding and
C	all the interbreeding and stuff
B	mm
C	but
B	and when I hadn't realised cos I've heard of it but I hadn't realised you've got Christmas at Cold Comfort Farm er was it Return to Cold Comfort Farm?
C	yes
A	yeah Conference is it? Conference at Cold Comfort Farm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	so I might fish out some of them at some point and er and have a read and I've I meant to say earlier actually my
B	I've never heard it described as that but I know exactly what you mean
A	mm
B	and er and it's er a book that you can say so if you like erm Stella Gibbons
C	Gibbons yeah
B	you can look up Stella Gibbons in the book and it'll say these authors also write in the same style
A	oh oh that's really good
B	so if you like
C	that's good yeah
B	yeah if you like her I don't know what it's called though she just described it as a looky-likey
A	it's a looky-likey book
B	yeah
B	so if er if you've
C	yeah
B	if you just like the the kind of the the way the
C	yeah
A	mm oh that is good
B	then you might like this author this author and this author
A	mm but I just rely on Amazon for that
C	yeah
B	yeah I do
A	Amazon recommends
B	yeah
C	what would you do without Amazon?
A	it knows the ones I've had so yeah good old Amazon
C	yeah what would you do without it?
A	mm
C	oh I bought this years ago actually
C	yeah
A	but I know at some point I know I was saying about some reading books and you er you just rattled off two or three
B	yeah
A	and that was one of the ones that you said to me and I actually read it then
B	yeah
A	and when you said last
B	yeah
A	I'm going no I haven't and I thought it was messing around
A	kept saying you've already purchased this when I looked and saw it was over a year ago I realised oh I'd read it
B	yeah
A	and I do that so often I read books
B	yeah
A	and then I totally forget I've read them
C	oh really?
B	mm
A	and I can get em and I start reading it and I start think this is a bit familiar
A	this is this is actually very familiar
B	that's the only thing I've erm I don't like about my Kindle
A	mm
B	cos when you when you're reading a book book
A	mm
B	the first thing you do is you see the title
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and and then you crack it open to where you need to be but with your Kindle you just switch it on it goes straight to that page
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and I'm every time I read something on a Kindle I can't remember what it's called
A	mm can't remember what book you're reading
B	I don't know what it's called cos I I only it's only when we're in book club that we say this is the title of it
A	mm
B	and then you download it
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and you don't see the title again normally after that
A	mm
C	do you know I have to admit I really do miss reading proper books erm cos I took erm I let
A	yeah
C	that's where I used to always
A	yeah
B	mm
C	look for books but I don't even like you know I just walk straight past it now and I did think
A	yeah
C	oh I did look at one and thought oh it looks nice
B	mm
C	I'll look at that on Amazon later but
A	mm
C	I you know that feeling of actually having books
B	yeah
A	cos I used to go to charity shops
C	oh yeah I love going to charity shops yeah
A	I used to go and rummage through charity shops or boot fairs or something and just go along
B	Tesco's is fab
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	the offers yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
B	so fifty P for a paperback
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	well I think that but I know I wouldn't actually want to read a book again because the odd time we've had a book with book club that we've only been able to get in er in an actual book copy I've really
C	that's the only thing
A	when I'm waiting somewhere and I'd flick it on my phone maybe and read four or five pages while I'm in the queue somewhere
B	mm
A	I can't do that if I've actually got a book to you er
C	yeah
A	cos you don't get the book out and stand and
B	yeah
C	that's the thing yeah
A	that sort of stuff so yeah I must admit I that's the only only thing I don't like now and that's why I don't I always read
B	the convenience
C	yeah
A	I know cos I've got the app on the
C	yeah
A	so I'll just have that with me all the time and read that erm
C	I know
A	mm
C	cos I read often read on my phone or my Ipad whatever
B	mm
A	yeah yeah I do
C	whatever I can really
A	well I said my Kindle I've got a Kindle from when I had it originally and I take that on holiday so if I'm on the beach
C	yeah it's perfect isn't it?
A	that's or by the pool or something like that
B	mm
A	I've got that
C	it's perfect
A	because I know then I don't mind if that gets a bit of sand on it or a bit of whatever
C	yeah
A	it's not my Ipad
C	exactly
B	mm
A	and you can actually get erm the internet on that as well now can't you? on the Kindle
C	oh yeah yeah
B	yeah
B	and was it you that said when you got your your Kindle you you actually got it because you were fed up with having a laptop in bed? and you found the
A	no
B	er somebody said to me they'd got a erm one of the Kindle's with internet access because their laptop was too cumbersome in bed
A	mm
B	so they bought the Kindle
A	yeah
B	to use for the internet
A	yeah
B	not for not for reading books
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	just because of its erm of the of the convenience of its size and everything
A	mm
C	I was really resistant to have a Kindle like when they first came out
A	yeah oh I was
C	I thought oh I wouldn't want that
A	that's what I said to
C	yeah oh why would I want that?
A	no
C	but then my sister got one and she kept raving about it so then I sort of looked at hers and thought oh that would be handy
A	mm
C	and then you don't look back then do you?
B	I'd never even looked at one in the shop I cos I
C	yeah
A	mm
B	being er a book lover
A	mm
C	yeah
B	I love books
C	yeah
A	mm
A	not anything else but I had when I first got a Blackberry it came with a few books on it er Sherlock Holmes
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and a bit of Shakespeare and something and so I I just started reading them
A	mm
B	and then hadn't even mentioned a Kindle
A	mm
B	and I kind of said to him that's really kind but I don't know if I'll use it really
A	yeah
B	and he's never touched it because he loves books so much but I would take them like if if we when we go to Dublin I'll read on the plane
A	mm
B	you you're hardly up there for fifty minutes
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	so you just pull it out read a couple of pages and
A	mm
B	and tuck it away but I wouldn't do that with a book because I'd be afraid of damaging it or
A	what? reading it on a plane?
B	well just trying to shove it in a case or
A	or just shove it oh yeah yeah yeah
C	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	you know having a big enough handbag or something for it and
A	mm
C	mm
B	and spoiling it
C	see I love the choice
A	mm
C	cos I think there's nothing worse than if you say I used to if you're going on holiday I'll buy like five or six books
A	yeah
B	mm
C	I'll be really excited about this is what I'm gonna read on holiday but if you get a rubbish one I'll be like oh don't wanna read that
B	yeah I don't wanna read
A	mm
C	I'll leave that here
A	yeah
C	and then I'll be like oh I'll read the next one but obviously when you're carrying like five hundred books around with you
A	yeah yeah
C	you don't really have that problem
B	mm
A	no that's it
B	no
A	well
C	yeah
B	mm
A	and he'd be out there for so long and I'd be flying backwards and forwards and he got me it for Christmas and he said I know you don't want one he said but
C	yeah
A	er up and down and then er just use it like that and I started using it and that was it that's
C	mm
B	mm
A	so the only books I've read since is one that I read to try and help me with my maths which is er for like about teenage lads to help them with their maths and stuff and I thought oh yeah and it's really good or primary school lads erm but apart from that er it's only been when book club it's
C	yeah
A	we can't get it on
B	mm
A	what
A	but er I then just go yes and go on and find another book I won't actually get the hard copy of that to read it
C	yeah I'm the same
B	yeah yeah
A	even if I want to read the book because I think
B	out of principle?
A	er well no it's it's not that it's just
C	convenience?
A	I'm so conditioned now that I read on my Ipad
B	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I read on my Ipad and on my Iphone I don't I don't read books
B	mm
A	and it's not anything against books
B	and are you happy paying the prices? Kindle prices
A	yeah cos usually they're cheaper than
C	a lot cheaper
A	the hard back anyway
B	yeah
A	or free or yeah but I mean I'll just buy it anyway if I wanted it
B	mm
A	it wouldn't matter to me how much it was
B	I do like that there are so many free ones or so cheap even if you pay ninety-nine P
A	mm yeah
B	for something
A	mm
C	yeah they are really cheap I did see today when I was in WH Smith just erm in the window Kate you liked Kate Mosse didn't you?
A	mm
C	the one who did erm
A	yes Labyrinth
C	Labyrinth her new one is out
A	is it?
C	called The Taxidermist's Daughter
A	oh right
C	and it said oh half price eight pound fifty I thought eight pound fifty?
A	eight pound fifty?
B	eight pound fifty?
C	thought well it won't be that on the Kindle
A	no
B	but my treat is to erm to go to Waterstones
C	oh
A	mm
B	and we'll spend an hour
C	yeah
B	walking around
C	yes of course
A	yeah
A	but I must admit I mean for me a brand new book er particularly like a real hardback book
C	yeah
A	it's almost like when you open when you used to have jars of coffee
C	yeah
A	before machines you used to open that and you'd break the foil and you'd get that smell
C	yeah smell yeah
A	and to me that new book when you open it
C	yeah
A	and it's like totally new and uncreased and you almost don't want to fold it back
C	yeah
A	to keep it open so I do I do miss books but I know I'd never read them again now in the same way because
C	yeah
A	er I've as I say I've been conditioned into doing this
C	we've moved on
A	yeah well exactly yeah
C	that's it we have haven't we?
A	yeah
C	but erm I have started cos I've got so many books in there but I was saying to
A	mm yeah
C	imagine how many books we would have
A	yeah
C	if we didn't have the Kindle
A	mm
C	I was saying I'd probably have about another two hundred books where would I have put them?
A	yeah yeah
C	erm but my mother-in-law always used to for my birthday she'd like spend like say fifty pound on new books for me on Amazon
A	mm
C	and like no one can buy you books any more can they?
A	no
C	that's the only thing like you can't get books as presents
A	no er cos I wanted to buy somebody a gift voucher for the Kindle
C	yeah
A	as such to buy a book but you can't you can buy an Amazon voucher
C	yeah yeah
A	but that isn't the same as buying a book
C	exactly yeah
A	or book voucher there's erm an app or a website I saw that you can go in and choose the book and they then send the card through to the person or something through to the person
C	yeah
A	and that person then buys the book for the Kindle
C	yeah
A	but I thought I don't necessarily want to choose the book for the person and
C	yeah exactly yeah you just want like a Kindle
A	yeah
C	er yeah I'm surprised they don't do that
A	I'm sure that they'll I'm sure they will yeah
C	I'm sure they will yeah
A	we just need to say to
C	yeah we do
A	cos you you should er I mean they might even do it for this year it's probably one of these things that they've thought about and they'll do
C	yeah
A	so you can actually buy a Kindle gift voucher rather than just an Amazon gift voucher
C	yeah exactly yeah exactly
A	yeah which'd be which'd be good
C	oh definitely yeah what am I reading? oh I finished that Little Lies that one
A	oh yeah oh I downloaded that
C	yeah
A	but I'm halfway through the Roy Grace one

C	but erm yeah
B	I can't remember
C	I know
B	I know it was weird
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it is weird
C	best way to describe it
B	yeah
C	I'll have to Youtube Youtube's got everything
B	wasn't his his his mum had died and she was still up there dead wasn't she?
C	that was it was that it?
B	and he was dressing up
C	dressing up that was it
B	in her clothes
C	yeah clothes
B	to almost bring her back to life again
C	yeah
A	excellent
B	mm
C	creepy
A	anyway back to the book
C	mm yes
B	mm
A	so right yeah as as I say I read it
B	yep
B	mm
A	erm and it's funny because it was only when you said this
C	yeah
A	erm things like er the Flora whatever her name at some point through it she started to really annoy me cos I was thinking
C	yeah
A	if I was there I'd probably've
B	yeah no weird interbred line
A	and it just yeah and and like at the end when matey flies in and then she goes off and they live happily ever after I suddenly thought it changed into a totally different book
C	yeah
A	because it was suddenly you didn't need the big cheesy grin at the end with them getting married and
C	yeah
A	living er happily ever after I loved the things like the names of the cows
B	mm
C	yeah
A	was it? Feckless
C	Pointless
C	Aimless
B	Graceless
C	yeah
A	yeah er yeah so er I I loved all that sort of stuff but it was only when you said er recommending it for this time and said erm oh it's your favourite satire and all this sort of thing
C	yeah
A	and when I actually looked and I was trying to buy it and wondering why it wouldn't let me buy it again and I was seeing the things with the reviews and I thought actually cos I didn't read it at all as a satire book
C	oh okay
A	and it was only when I looked and saw sort of started looking into it again and saw the character names Mrs Smiling who is the nice
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and I totally missed all I just read it as a book without
B	mm
A	and when I started going through it
B	mm
A	and all this sort of stuff and just and I I say I hadn't read it like that but I did really enjoy it I did did really enjoy it apart from the when she started to annoy me to a certain point and
A	things like when it was all being built up I think when it was gonna be was it for the wedding? some somebody's wedding they were organising in the house
B	mm
C	yeah
A	and they were trying to do it without the old lady knowing
C	yeah
A	and it was all gonna be fine and then they got her down and then it was just you sort of thought well that was setting things up so much for a fall that actually
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	real life even
C	yeah
A	things like that annoyed me but erm but yeah I suppose the quote cos I gave it seven out of ten
B	okay
A	erm and er I just great escapism
C	great
A	yeah
C	oh I've written loads I'll fill it up as there's only us three
C	so
A	mm
C	erm I give it nine out of ten I will say it's my favourite book cos I always think that it's like me and my sister's kind of sense of humour
B	mm
C	like we find it
A	mm
C	I just I think oh my sister read it when she was about fourteen and I think I must have read it I would've been
A	impressionable age
B	mm
A	mm
C	yeah we just I find it really funny it's my sense of humour I guess
B	I found it very witty I've I I did like
A	mm
B	even the the ones that you want to slap I think I thought there was all it was very quaint and painted the author had painted
A	mm
B	really lovely pictures of of all the characters and really set the scenes and when they were decorating the farm for the wedding
A	yeah
B	you could picture what they were doing with all the flowers and erm just
A	mm
B	I I thought but er I can't say it made me laugh out loud necessarily but I did sort of titter
A	mm
B	at at several little bits and it did encourage me to look to see what other books the author had written on that same on the Cold Comfort theme so erm yes I'll be I'll looking out for them and getting them
A	mm
C	I've got another one I could recommend you if you like this erm by Nancy Mitford called er Move Over Darling which is a bit sort of er nineteen thirties kind of satirey kind of one
B	mm
C	but they're kind of cos erm the Mitford Sisters were really interesting cos I only realised when I I think I picked that up in a charity shop and I
A	mm
C	but again it's quite witty but she was one of erm think her sister was like a Nazi wasn't she? or something they're all quite famous like I think all there was erm two or three and they're like quite well bred kind of post World War Two family
A	mm
C	and one of them was an author one of em I think was very high up with Hitler like a British girl who ran off to Germany to join the Nazis and the other one's did various bits and bobs as well I think one of em was in the fascists or something like the British Union of Fascists but they're all really interesting anyway
A	mm
C	so that's I think it's called Move Over Darling that's quite good is it Move Over Darling? or something it's got darling
B	yeah Move Over
C	is it called that? what's it got?
C	what's the what's the rating on Amazon? it might have a
C	no
B	oh
C	let me put in the author's name cos it might not be Move Over Darling it might be something darling
C	I'll know from when I see it
B	because Move Over Darling was a film with erm
B	oh
C	The Blessing three ninety-five
B	oh I like the sound of Move Over Darling
A	I found one called The Darlings
B	Move Over Darling had Diana I was trying to say Dors was it Dors? Diana Dors Diana
C	think it just says The Blessing is a hilarious tale of love and fidelity
B	who was in Calamity Jane?
C	oh
B	mm
A	Calamity Jane?
C	mm
B	well that kind of era
A	Diana?
B	is it Diana?
C	anyway I quite that's quite a good book
B	right what is it IMDb? IMBb?
B	Doris Day
A	oh Doris Day
B	yeah not
A	not Diana no
B	yeah Doris Day she was in Move Over Darling
A	mm
B	er The Blessing?
C	yes
B	can't find it
C	if you put in Nancy Mitford then it'll it'll come I
B	erm I need to give a score don't I? I'm gonna give a score of eight out of ten please
C	lovely
A	mm
C	we should do the next meeting
A	we should
B	yeah
A	do you want to know about the next book?
C	oh yes yeah sorry let me just er
B	how are we choosing the next book?
A	well er
C	do you wanna just choose any book
B	I don't have I don't have the list
C	no
A	oh well er but it was said on
C	that's really stupid
A	but yeah
B	and you were honest?
A	I said I did
C	why didn't you lie?
A	cos she was gonna send me it if I didn't have it
B	oh flip
C	can you not?
A	well
C	can you not just choose a book
A	yeah er yeah that's true erm in that case I'll
C	she chose a thriller though the irony of it is is
B	yeah
A	she chose I Am Pilgrim didn't she?
C	she chose I Am Pilgrim which was the best thriller of the best thrillers of the lot
A	and that was one of the best books we've read yeah
B	when is his next book coming out? hasn't it gone to
A	well no he's er he's got erm two three and four in his head ready but he's gonna do the screenplay for erm I Am Pilgrim
B	I Am Pilgrim
C	oh that'll be a good film though
A	so yeah but cos he is his background is writing screenplays isn't it?
C	yeah yeah
A	action films
B	well as long as it's not Tom Cruise playing
A	well no
C	I think it'd be better as a TV series
A	depends if Tom Cruise'll erm if he buys
C	yeah
A	the rights to the film then he'll be in it I'm sure
C	probably will
A	but it'll be I'm hoping he's gonna he'll get the other books going and get the next books coming out
B	mm
A	but he said he wasn't gonna spend all the time writing the second one until he knew how the first one was received
A	and then everybody loved it so
B	yeah exactly so he needs to get his finger out and
A	mm
B	get the next one out
A	yeah
C	I hope it's not too rushed if he does it as a film cos a lot happens doesn't it? they don't wanna miss any things out
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	it'd be better as a TV like a Homeland kinda
A	yeah series
C	TV series wouldn't it?
A	yeah yeah I think so
C	yeah oh sorry
B	sorry
A	mm
C	right shall we do our next date?
B	mm
A	yes let's do the next date
C	yeah let's do the date so
A	and then I think what we need to do is have a bit of a chat with everyone involved and say let's decide what we're doing for the books and stuff
B	or
C	it's got too complicated now as well because
A	yeah
C	I think no one's got a grip on what's actually happening
B	yeah
A	no
B	and I don't think that's any any person's fault anybody's fault at all
C	no no no not at all
B	we've just kind of lost our way a little bit
A	mm
B	I think as well where we've had people drop out
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	people have come in so they've
B	the rota's got shorter because the number of people is er less
A	yeah yeah this is it yeah
B	what if here's a suggestion what if you just choose a book
A	mm
B	nominate a book
A	mm
B	if you have one in mind that that you'd like to and then we say erm whilst we know we've got the list
A	mm
B	we couldn't actually or or you couldn't find one that you would personally nominate
A	mm
B	so if nobody has an
A	mm
C	yeah go on
B	if anybody objects strongly
A	yeah yeah
B	then we can revisit the list
A	yeah
C	yeah that's a good idea
A	yeah because I mean I've found one that I looked er cos I was
B	mm
A	and thought no no no no no and then I found one
B	and if nothing really jumps out
A	well I found one that I thought I was actually chuckling reading it but it's meant to be one that people either laugh out loud and thinks really funny
C	yeah
A	or don't get in the slightest so I thought well that could get a good discussion going
C	mm
B	mm
A	but erm no I think I'll er I'll have to have a think though cos I haven't got a
C	well of course yeah yeah of course
A	choose one else it won't be a very good one
B	I mean lists as well it depends how they're compiled
A	mm
C	mm
B	doesn't it? if they're if they're
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	but this list it's a hundred books to read before you die and it's been compiled by somebody so it's all the greats and the this and the that
B	but who who says it's great
A	well exactly yeah yeah
C	mm
B	this is an argument that
A	mm
B	you watch these top ten of this and top ten of that
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	and we'll be screaming at the TV saying well who chose not in my top ten
C	yeah
A	no exactly what about this? what about that?
B	who put that one in there? yeah yeah
A	mm yeah okay that's fine so let's do a date one two three four
B	so you need to be after the
A	well my operation's the thirteenth
B	did you say the thirteenth?
C	okay
A	so it's whether to say to do it the I wouldn't be er that week I'm in hospital anyway but whether do it the week after that
B	I can't do Thursday the twenty-third
A	right
B	I could do Thursday the thirtieth
A	well
B	I can't do the ninth
A	cos otherwise it's gonna drift again oh you can't do the ninth?
B	no
A	actually you're gonna get really busy with your parties now aren't you?
B	yeah that's what I'm I'm doing one in
A	mm
C	what if we do it on a Wednesday instead of a Thursday?
A	yeah
B	huh Great British Bake Off although I record it
A	mm yeah mm mm mm
B	I'll sacrifice it for book club
C	it might be over by then
A	or a or a Tuesday or something we could always
C	yeah
A	that's something I think we maybe need to talk about as a group is erm Thursday's used to be cos
B	and and
A	yeah did snooker
B	was out bowling or something wasn't he?
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm
C	I can't really do a Tuesday
A	okay
C	only cos
A	mm
B	oh right
C	on a Tuesday you see but erm I could come up I just erm can come afterwards it just you know what it's like I'll just wait for him to come back then I'll go so I'd just be a bit late
A	oh no no no
B	mm
A	but that's
C	when when are you back
A	I have the operation on the thirteenth
C	yeah
A	and and I
C	yep
A	erm
B	mm be seven weeks
A	yeah I think it's about seven weeks or so before I can drive
A	but I can always be picked up and taken somewhere
C	yeah of course
A	but obviously it's
B	well I'm sailing right past your house if it's anywhere
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	you know this direction
A	yeah it it's just obviously the
C	we don't want yeah that's what I mean
B	yeah
C	I don't want you to be under pressure
A	so
C	yeah I can do the thirtieth
B	thirtieth's good for me
A	yeah?
C	well let's say the thirtieth
A	okay which I'm gonna write that down instead of erm
C	it's sort of it's got really strange with the choices do you
A	yeah thanks
B	mm
C	with all the book choices now though hasn't it? because it's like you're choosing tonight but then on your night is
A	yeah I think I think it has and the thing is cos we
C	yeah
A	cos we've often hosted for other people anyway
C	that's it as well yeah yeah
A	which has got it out of
C	yeah exactly yeah yeah
A	but actually it's yeah it's got a bit out of sync but I can't remember what
C	maybe that's why cos I've definitely done three so I know I've I'm cos people have only had two
A	yeah oh no I've done
C	yeah so
B	yeah I've done two I think
A	mm
A	I don't know
C	no me neither
A	I'm gonna stop this
C	well we said book club at
A	yeah to be confirmed
C	to be confirmed
C	I think it's cos
B	and she and
A	yeah she was in New York wasn't she?
C	we had that rota didn't we?
A	yeah
C	and I think probably cos I've I bet it was
A	yeah
C	and then I bet the next one was the one where it all
B	mm
C	you know like got changed and everything
B	cos
A	mm
C	yeah
A	and you just sort of think I think
B	and she hasn't responded to that either
A	no I think er er to me it's almost like
C	yeah
A	then they just go along with the books that we're doing
C	yeah
A	cos it'd be a shame it er it's been so good it'd be a shame if it did drift out I mean er
C	yeah
A	it's been over two years we've been doing it
C	yeah
B	yeah er I think
A	and it's you know I've made some really good friends with
C	exactly
A	with coming doing this but
A	no
C	but I I do think that this new way of choosing books is to blame a little bit but I wasn't there for that one so I
A	no I wasn't
C	I would've strongly opposed it
A	yeah
C	cos I like choosing books that erm other
A	yeah cos it's a book you've enjoyed and it
C	yeah
A	not that you think everybody else is going to necessarily enjoy it cos some people won't
C	yeah
A	but it it's a book that you know you think is a good book
C	yeah
A	rather than just picking a book out of the air you can look at reviews and you can look at this that and the other but
C	but even if we were
A	yeah
C	even we could go through that
A	yeah
C	cos they're all a lot of those like The House at Riverton like those books like
A	mm
C	they're all on there aren't they?
A	mm
C	like all those kind of bestseller type books
A	yeah
C	if we wanted to do something that wasn't all classics
A	yeah and plus er yeah there must be some sort of book club recommends this
C	yeah book club recommendation
A	yeah
B	mm
C	cos a lot sometimes a lot of the Kindle books have the book book club notes at the back don't they?
A	yeah that's right yeah and questions for book club is that is that something?
C	I think they must be
B	discussion points
C	yeah discussion points and things
A	cos we used to all talk about it and then we used to er used to ask a question didn't we? like the person whose book it was'd ask a question
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	about the book and everybody had
C	oh yeah yeah we used to do it properly yeah
A	yeah and we used to do a lot more structured like that and then I think it then got cos
C	yeah
A	and
C	yeah
A	which is great and it but it's almost like we think well we need to maybe have social times as well as
C	yeah
A	which we you know we have done we've done Christmas and we've had the anniversary and
B	mm
C	yeah
A	and that sort of stuff and
B	cheese and wine
A	cheese and wine
C	oh yeah
A	lots of cheese
B	mm
A	more cheese more cheese
C	mm
B	a beehive
A	beehive
C	that was good
A	yeah yeah so maybe
C	yeah
A	we need to be doing stuff like that and have the social side and then try and keep the book
