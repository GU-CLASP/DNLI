B	later that's even more fascist
B	it's true isn't it?
A	it is a little creature it's even got furry erm blue bit but I don't need that that's only for when it's windy apparently
B	that reminds me of erm you know I've got the half-brother in
A	thank you
B	who's mad?
A	oh well yes
B	I mean he's not mad mad
A	this is the
B	but I think he is mad
A	yeah
B	he just hasn't been diagnosed
A	crikey
B	and everything's being controlled by somebody or other but it's all very vague
A	right
B	and I don't know whether it's because he takes drugs now he doesn't admit that he does whether it's because he's taken a lot of drugs in the past
A	right
B	or because that's just his personality and temperament
A	yeah
B	but just that reminded me he told me this story about when he was
A	right
B	Heathrow or something
A	yeah do you mind if I smoke?
B	no go for it go for it
A	okay
B	erm
A	I bought some cigarettes
B	I've got some somewhere I think as well
A	oh I've got loads so if you wanna smoke mine that's absolutely fine
B	and he said you know the reason they've built the new Terminal Five don't you? and I said
B	presumably I don't know like there's so much yeah it's not really something I
A	unless it's like to show off that
B	it's not something I've ever really
A	we can build a new terminal
B	dwelled on or
B	it's actually not something that's ever crossed my mind even for a fraction of a second and he said don't be facetious
A	oh
B	mm don't be facetious I actually genuinely wasn't being facetious
A	yeah
B	I thought he was asking me a question and I thought this is a bizarre question but then I'm totally perplexed by people most of the time
B	water off a duck's back
A	right
B	it's so they can spy on your they've embedded with these cameras and he said when I went to the bathroom I could see on the mirror I could see how it was working by the mirror so I went up to the mirror and I went fuck you
A	alright
B	and is said to him
A	at least that was in the bathroom
B	I said to him but if
B	and you're gonna be handcuffed and led away
B	and then the other thing I was thinking that I thought was really funny
B	you know a lot of people
A	him even more paranoid
B	well exactly
B	but you know a lot of people who are really
A	yeah
B	nervous flyers aren't they?
A	yeah
B	they get really anxious about
A	yeah
B	stepping outside their zone
B	and I was thinking imagine if you're feeling really edgy
A	yeah
B	and you just you know you're washing your hands just trying
A	yeah
B	to take a deep breath and cool down
A	yeah
B	and this maniac emerges from the cubical
B	or the urinal
A	going
B	or whatever it's like
A	there's a two-way mirror
B	yeah
A	there's like cameras that
B	fuck you
A	fuck everybody
B	so the
A	yeah
B	you know cos
A	yeah yeah I think that's what happens to people on planes
B	mm
A	and that's why people get all you know
B	yeah
A	quite upset because
B	it just reminded me if he saw that oh my goodness
B	he'd go potty
B	and if you don't agree with him he gets really
A	so he lives his life by
B	hostile
A	a conspiracy theory?
B	yeah
A	pretty much
B	lots of people are like that
A	it's true
B	and I always say to him
A	I've sort of I've managed to avoid them somehow
B	I say well let's just say let's say everything you're saying is true
A	mm
B	it wouldn't make any difference to the way I live my life
A	no
B	I'm still gonna wake up in the morning
A	yeah
B	I'm still gonna go to work I'm still gonna try to be
A	yeah
B	friendly to people
A	yeah
B	I'm still gonna enjoy going for a walk I'm still gonna enjoy
A	yeah
B	going and seeing a film
A	yeah
B	you know whether or not the world's controlled by
A	yeah
B	giant lizards is really neither here nor there to me you know I don't
B	maybe you are right maybe the
A	yeah
B	moon landings were faked and maybe the
A	yeah
B	Kennedy assassination wasn't what we were told maybe it was the Twin Towers story was I don't care
A	yeah
B	you know maybe it's true maybe it's not true I don't know
A	yeah
B	I wasn't there
A	there's no way of knowing anyway so
B	I would imagine most of them aren't true but
A	yeah
B	probably by law of averages some of them are true
A	yeah
B	by law of averages
A	that's true yeah
B	if you make up a thousand conspiracies
B	by law of averages you're gonna hit the nail on the head once but
A	but which what
B	why not try to sort your own life out and
A	yeah yeah
B	stop alienating everyone by your
A	yeah
B	awful behaviour
A	and taking up so much of your head space
B	yeah
A	could be better served something
B	and being barred from restaurants and being barred from hotels you're so rude and abusive but it's
A	oh no
B	never his fault and
A	oh right it's the conspiracy theory
B	he's actually very
A	what's his name?
A	right
B	he lives in
A	and you visit him there?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I actually like
A	yeah
B	his company he's quite fun to be around
A	mm
B	but for short periods
A	yeah
B	he really like overloads your
A	yeah
B	I don't know what to call it something between your soul and your mind and your brain
B	a pretty kind hearted person
A	yeah yeah
B	but she's really hard going
A	yeah you you told me about how
B	she wears me out ten times more than him
A	mm mm yeah yeah
B	cos at least he's got something to say
A	yeah
B	even if it's deranged you can just sit back and
A	and sort of let him talk but you don't have to
B	and he has enthusiasms
A	interact
B	as well which is nice
A	yeah
B	he's like
A	yeah
B	really enthusiastic and then he'll be really enthusiastic about something and then it'll fall out of favour
A	right
B	and then he'll have a new thing
A	yeah oh so he's a bit up and down yeah
B	yeah he's just
A	yeah
B	like over
A	yeah
B	manic
A	yeah okay yeah
B	yeah
A	and how long has he lived out there for?
B	he's lived there for something like fifteen years and
A	oh right
B	and the story of how he went there is quite funny in itself
A	right
B	erm
A	yeah
B	that
A	yeah
B	I think he got into that rock and roll lifestyle
A	yeah
B	but even when he was no longer rock and roll
A	mm
B	so he always used to like these really pretty young girls
A	mm
B	and they were always really nice
A	right
B	I think I've met four of them
A	mm
B	when I say young I mean ludicrously young
A	yeah okay yeah
B	and so
A	yeah
B	wanted to control and destroy
B	er a
A	right
B	when he was about
A	right
B	twenty
A	right
B	but she was
A	oh
B	and because she was Catholic and old-fashioned
A	right
B	so he was staying in a hotel or something while she stayed
A	right
B	and they sort of met
A	okay
B	and I think the family accepted it but they had to go through the motions of oh it's just a friendship or I don't really know
A	oh okay right
B	but then erm
A	oh right
B	or something and erm
A	wonderful
B	I think the girl finally realised he's a bit too mad to hang around with so she got rid of him but for some reason he just stayed in
A	right
B	and then er he went to a fortune teller
A	right
B	so when he was in a nightclub in
B	and he met a girl from
B	I promise you this is true well this is what he told me he thought oh this is you know
A	this is it
B	my destiny
A	yeah yeah this is my happiness
B	and again and just like the
A	yeah
B	really lovely
A	yeah
B	nice sort of I don't know not middle class I don't know what middle class means but just like well-mannered and
A	yeah
B	and civil and
A	yeah
B	civilised and oh nice to meet you
A	mm
B	you know and try and find something positive to say
A	friendly yeah
B	like oh that's you
A	yeah
B	have a good flight or like very nice but not mindless
A	yeah
B	just simple girls you know
A	yeah
B	I think one was a hairdresser one was a beautician
A	yeah
B	and erm and yeah that didn't work either
[ANNOTATION]	the girls had works related to physical appearence	Entailment
A	didn't work either
B	no just
A	so he didn't go back to that fortune teller
B	no
A	go a conspiracy theory
B	and it's like typical theme like
[ANNOTATION]	he still goes to a fortune teller	Contradiction
A	mm
B	and then when they've fallen out of favour oh suddenly
A	yeah
B	they've transformed into the devil incarnate
A	right okay
B	even though the poor girl hasn't changed
A	oh wow
B	you know
A	oh
B	those sorts of people they have those enthusiasms
A	but he doesn't go after them afterwards sort of thing or oh thank god for that
B	no I don't think so I think he's a megalomaniac in a way
A	mm
B	he sort of thinks that
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and he's got his sunglasses and his nice car
[ANNOTATION]	the man is very bad	Entailment
A	yeah
B	you know and his stories that he spins
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah no similar in some ways similar
A	yeah
B	maybe the next
A	yeah that's right
A	you never know
B	I don't do MPs I've heard I've heard of an MP3
[ANNOTATION]	the stories are all very different	Contradiction
A	there's a couple of clicks and buttons
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b listens to music every day	Neutral
B	is it like a tape basically?
A	it well yes it is it's just
B	yeah
A	that's their format that they want so this would doesn't
B	is it is an MP3 is a tangible thing or it's
A	it's like an iTunes you know that's what I was gonna say it is tangible
B	can you can you touch it? okay it's not a concept it's
A	I it's a touch it as it click it through the
[ANNOTATION]	MP3 is similar to iTunes	Entailment
B	yeah
A	it's a digital touch as in you click on there
B	okay
A	on on the file
B	ah so a file
A	like a Word document or
B	okay
A	it's just a document
B	so it's yeah
A	yeah yeah so it's just a file and so I know how to do that so that's two clicks
A	but I've I've made these files and I go over them and I just basically have to write in what it's slightly about you know
B	should be quite interesting
A	yeah it is it is actually really interesting on some of the conversations because what's happened is that they somehow cos I've got an Apple Mac and I don't' know how it works but somehow these MP3 files are recognised by Itunes because Itunes only use MP3 files for audio
B	I'm sorry about on ITunes is I've heard of all these things
B	I've heard of MP3 I don't I know there's such a thing as MP3
B	cos there's an MP3 player as well isn't there?
A	yeah that's right
B	and I've heard of Itunes but
A	yeah
B	I don't know what it is I've just heard
A	yeah
B	of ITunes
A	so my little thing that I put on
B	there's like Ipods and Ipads and Ebay I've heard of the words of the
A	yeah
B	terms but
A	and and they are just files and and so because they're
B	they just went there on their own?
A	yeah and then when I do my auto sync for my little MP3 player which is this tiny little one that you know when I'm
B	yeah
A	walking around and
B	basically like a Walkman?
A	yes just like a Walkman
B	yeah
A	and then I I I switch it on and there's a bit of music and then there's something and then all of a sudden it's one of these recordings so it's one of the conversations
B	oh that's quite funny
A	so this
B	but you'll start to see people in a whole new light
A	well I re-listened
B	no because sometimes
A	yeah you do
B	when you've got that immediacy
A	yeah you don't realise
B	it's very different
A	mm mm
B	from afterwards because I think
A	yeah
B	but it's not that
A	yeah
B	at all it's to do with the way the person is
A	exactly
B	I know people who I think they're quite cognitively challenged
A	yeah
B	and the types of things they talk about are not of any actual interest to me
A	yeah
B	but I love their company
A	the way they're saying it yeah
B	I love
A	yeah
B	I love being around them
A	yeah
B	they lift my spirits
A	yeah
B	they're just so nice and yet and there are other people who I think
A	yeah
B	we've got a lot in common we've got a similar interest
A	yeah
B	we're probably a similar level of education
A	yeah
B	IQ
A	yeah
B	erm ideology and yet they're just unbearable
A	yeah
B	probably because they're like me but I mean I just I wouldn't wanna be around them too much
A	no
B	and that's why I never understand how this erm
A	oh I don't know anything about that
B	because let's say if like people I know people who've done it like
A	right
A	what what is it?
B	a way of finding a
A	it's a dating agency?
B	boyfriend
A	okay
B	but via
A	it's like a matchmaking
B	the computer yeah
A	yeah
B	er and then you also tapped in what your idea of an absolute nightmare would be
A	yeah
B	the chances are you're gonna prefer
B	because it's nothing to do with you know just because somebody likes reading and likes going to the cinema and likes learning languages
A	doesn't mean you're going to like the same types of books or anything
B	no it's just
A	yeah that's right
B	but it's
A	the whole approach might be completely different
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah I know what you mean
B	it's nothing to do with anything you can put your finger on just some people you take to
A	yeah
B	and some people you don't
A	yeah I hadn't thought about it like that before but even so just er this afternoon I got on the train and I was listening to a bit of music and then all of a sudden the conversation from erm the time when I met er my mum's half-sister came on
B	I really wanna hear about that
A	which is actually
B	I really that's the first thing I wanna hear about
A	which is actually two hours long the whole thing she was completely fine with it
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a's mother comes from Hungary	Neutral
B	and that's the first time you'd met her?
A	yeah
B	so that says something for her because
A	and we went through everything
B	because a lot of people
A	we went through death we went through the fact that her
B	so her father was your mum's father?
A	that's right so my grandfather
B	yeah
A	so we
B	so this is the grandfather that you never really knew about?
A	absolutely
B	cos it was always like your granny I remember even from
A	yeah
B	school days I remember
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is not blood related to the woman they are talking about	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	it was always granny wasn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a's grandad worked as an accountant	Neutral
A	yeah it was always like granny
B	basically mum and granny wasn't it?
A	granny this and granny that yes it was yeah
B	wasn't even maybe granny even a bit more than mum
B	same as for me
B	yeah
A	I re-listened to it and you're right erm
B	yeah
A	we just gelled and you can tell
B	and then I'm sure it's not
A	there's this
B	but you wonder whether there's
A	it's not niceties
B	something in the genes or something
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has a child	Neutral
A	yeah
B	that you
A	oh gosh I wonder
B	I don't know probably not
A	there were things
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b did not mention genetics	Contradiction
B	but it crosses your mind
A	yeah there were things when I thought to myself
B	some kind of mannerism or turn of phrase
A	yeah
B	or
A	yeah absolutely like even at the end when erm so she's actually in a wheelchair because she has erm
B	oh okay
[ANNOTATION]	she was in a wheelchair because she had a car accident	Neutral
A	she erm but only for I suppose it when she turned fifty she really needed to use a wheelchair
B	okay
A	but before that she was getting around on crutches and things and everything was fine
B	mm
A	erm so yeah erm then she said oh now I I'll erm I'll see you to the door and I said yes thank you and then we had a little chat before I left and she said now it's very Welsh for the person to stay by the door and wave the the person who's leaving off
B	oh yeah but I do that as well
A	you know that's nice and that so I said no and I
B	either you walk them to wherever they're going
A	yeah
B	or
A	yeah
B	you yeah
A	but I said to her that's what mummy and granny always used to do
B	yeah
A	you know to me
B	but to me that's just manners
A	so I had a little wobble at that point
B	yeah
A	cos I was like whoa cos I thought oh I was doing really well
B	it must have been really emotionally
A	and then I
B	overwhelming
A	I just caught a glimpse of her and cos we were talking about this mad
B	yeah
A	and she was talking about
B	I can remember your dad showing me a letter
A	droopy eyelids right okay
B	and he's got really
A	he has
B	I'd always be
A	he has
B	suspicious of someone who had such neat writing
B	yeah
A	so he can still write really quite well
B	but I think I never you know when you come in on something sometimes
A	yeah
B	and people seem to assume that you know everything that went before
A	yeah
B	but you don't so they start talking
A	oh I know I I have friends like that
B	but you actually don't know what they're talking about because they haven't set
A	yeah
B	the scene they haven't given you any context
A	mm
B	so oh so and another and I never even
A	yeah
B	I couldn't even get to the bottom of who he was
A	yeah
B	and you know there are some people who don't really welcome interruption they wanna just talk?
B	and so you're getting more and more perplexed and you're thinking
A	yeah that's right
B	hang on so who's this
B	and so I sort of know all these details but
A	yeah but
B	but I don't really understand
A	don't know what the backdrop is
B	yeah it's just some sort of morass of
A	yes
B	cos I don't understand what his research
A	neither do I
B	something to do with genes or something genetics or something like
A	all I know is that he's been in he's been researching the
B	but I know it's a stupid question but why?
A	I don't know
B	but is he's not
A	he he he
B	I understand obviously you and mum's half-sister that's
A	erm
B	easy to understand that's someone who
A	how did he come into it?
B	had the same dad as your mum but I don't understand
A	I think he is related to the
B	oh he's
A	blood line but I think maybe through marriage or something
B	oh so he is
A	he's related
B	oh that makes it a bit less weird
A	yeah
B	I thought I cos I didn't understand what was going on and I just thought that
A	I don't really understand it myself
B	maybe he somehow tracked down your dad somehow and
A	yeah
B	yeah probably
A	that
B	probably
A	their measurements would be
B	but what sort of measurements
A	mum is the product of
B	what sort of is it what is it? is it
A	everything now
B	everything? like
A	and he sent a list to me
B	measure your skull?
A	oh my gosh everything like
B	give you a personality tests?
A	even if you IQ er honestly
A	yeah everything like even if you were
B	cos I said to you I said to your dad
A	paying
B	oh
A	you know when we did it in biology?
B	erm whether you can roll your tongue?
A	yes
B	cos I said to your dad it sounds like
A	all manners of things
B	the Nazis you and they measure your skull and see what
A	oh it's it's it is
B	race you or
A	like that
A	put off by the whole thing and also what I explained to her is she's done the measurements but I
B	mm
A	neither yes or no
B	it is I'm not being funny but
A	cos I'm not sure if my mum would like it
B	what would you gain from it?
A	mm
B	what would you I don't really understand
A	well I wouldn't gain anything
B	what you're meant to get out of it
A	I think that's probably what like
B	yeah and if they tell you oh you've got some sort of genetic disease
A	yeah
B	and you're gonna die next year it's probably better not to know cos
A	well that's what I think but fundamentally I'm not sure whether I'm okay with it because I don't think
B	I just don't see it's any of his business
A	mum or gran
B	no
A	would be cool with it
B	because otherwise they'd have told you
A	right
B	if they wanted you to be involved in all this
A	yes
B	they'd have told you
A	that's where I'm coming from
B	and people keep things to themselves
A	yeah
B	for good reasons
A	yeah
B	and that's their business and it's their choice
A	that's right so those two sort of things compounded together means I'm probably not going to do it
B	mm
A	because I also know that he's he's written to her over years to ask her what she's developing for different diseases and whatnot and everything
B	yeah
A	years of this
B	slippery slope
A	until he until he passes on
B	yeah
A	but then he has a daughter who is
B	cos I said to your dad I said I don't understand what
B	what just out of the
A	nothing
B	kindness of your heart
A	yeah
B	you agree to be experimented on by a total stranger?
A	mm mm
B	well why would you?
A	as
B	you know
A	as as
B	you'd rather take Dobby for a walk if you've got some spare time
A	exactly and she said it's such an academic speak it's really not a subject that's actually you know one of those interesting ones where you'd sort of pick it up and go alright
B	and I mean it's nice to have a hobby but
B	what's an eighty-four year old doing
A	well she said
B	shouldn't he be playing bridge?
A	well this is what I thought I she said well he's just a very has just a very inquiring mind he's just that
B	bit obsessive
A	he
B	and he's rude as well
A	and he's obsessive he's rude
B	cos I know this is a stereotype
A	he's
B	but I always think elderly people have many faults
A	mm
B	but one of the things stereotyping that I tend to like about elderly people is they're usually extremely well mannered
A	yeah
B	and very civil
A	yeah
B	and very aware of your feelings
A	yeah
B	those letters were so rude
A	they're very rude and they're
B	just the fact that it's couched in
A	the terms that it is yeah
B	articulate terminology
A	mm
B	cos
A	that's her thing
B	I thought
A	that's what she's dedicated her life to
B	I got
A	yes
B	was also the father of this lady?
B	that's that's straightforward
B	now was it that his father allegedly fathered all these children or something?
A	no
B	or was that him himself
A	that
B	or his father?
A	that that well there well there is it's definitely the
B	somebody allegedly they had
A	the grey
B	all these illegitimate children or something
A	it yes the great grandfather
B	is that why does he want to know this?
A	there there were rumours and nothing has been proved now
B	yeah but
A	and so is her brother
B	yeah
A	but that's about the only thing that we can say is true because everything else is just really theoretical
B	cos I didn't understand when your dad was explaining it I didn't understand who it was who was supposed to have been rumoured to have
A	yeah
B	I hadn't I I was thinking hang on so is this how many generations are we going back?
A	oh well I mean I think
B	and you you know when you
A	both of them can go back
B	try to ask and you just get another
A	dad wouldn't know
B	barrage of
A	you know what she sent me today? is a two-volumes
B	yeah
A	and she's sent them in two separate
B	and it's awful cos if she's really nice you feel that you want to be receptive
A	and I've got this now and then she
B	burn it
A	and then she started a letter going on about you know
B	can of worms
A	well I suppose what happened was is that she
B	yeah
A	granny's side
B	yeah
A	and she said oh are you interested in learning how to do it? and I sort of said yes if I had the time
B	in theory
A	yeah
B	in theory which is not necessarily in practice
A	oh I I'd never have the time
B	hypothetically
A	to do it
B	in an ideal world
A	all the information
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	obviously in an ideal world
A	yeah
B	we'd all like to
B	know how to do everything
A	yeah exactly
B	but that doesn't mean you've actually got the intention of
B	yeah a bit of a nudge
A	so she wrote to me yeah a bit of a nudge and she wrote to me and said
B	but of a shove
A	here you go this is what the
B	so
A	er
A	erm well there's three different surnames there's
B	okay
A	yeah
B	okay so it was granddad who was
A	yes
B	didn't really know anything about
A	yes
B	okay
B	so your mum was a
A	yeah
B	okay got it
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	so but the other side
B	mm
A	is is what I'm really more interested in
B	yeah because why would you be interested in some guy you've never
A	well it's that's the married side that's the
B	yeah
A	bit that really kind of you know
B	he he played no part in your life
A	not at all
B	and your mum and granny to the extent to which they did know anything chose not to divulge it
A	absolutely
B	she's laid the groundwork hasn't she?
A	crikey
B	she's been doing her
B	pat the ground preparation
A	and also I'm meant to go and see her again and I know that she's a teacher
B	like a little fly going into the spider's web
B	isn't it
A	I think she's set me some homework to do
B	yeah
B	explicitly really
A	but then she
B	but she was nice
A	you know she
B	so she's what sort of age?
A	she's about sixty-seven I think
B	yeah
A	I say about sixty-seven she is sixty-seven
B	so
A	cos that's what she
B	a bit younger than your mum would have been?
A	yeah though there's
B	a little bit
A	some
B	when you hear most people's life story I don't think it bears any relation
A	there are
B	to reality at all you know
A	yes yes
B	and it's like
A	there are years missing in my life already
B	cos I've so trusting yeah but I'm so trusting
B	I'm so
A	yeah
B	like a child
A	yeah
B	I'm so naïve like if someone tells me something I just assume it's true
A	well yeah so do I yeah I wouldn't even think
B	I just presume it's true
A	to question it
B	and then after time passes you think hang on there's
A	yeah
B	and you realise like most people are just making up everything
A	well that's it
B	it's really weird
A	yeah
B	but they don't even make up anything good if I was gonna make something up I'd try and make up a really
A	fantastical story yeah
B	fantastic story you know to really
A	yeah
B	mesmerise my audience
B	but they make up funny things
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you know
A	it's true it's like why would you bother?
B	things that wouldn't possibly impress you
A	no not at all yeah
B	yeah
A	just like or
B	or that's not even interest I mean it's interesting but it's not
A	maybe for lack of imagination
B	it's no more interesting than the reality the reality is
A	yeah it's probably lack of their imagination but so anyway she was there at the same time well no one year out I think erm they went to the same teacher training college
B	ah the two
A	mm
B	the half-sisters and did they know that they were each other's half-sisters? we don't know
A	she knew when she started
B	and we don't know whether your mum did?
A	mum possibly not because she wouldn't have known she was going yet cos she was a year after but what had happened is the lecturer in education
B	it's weird isn't it?
A	said erm do you have erm
B	yeah are you expecting a male?
A	so she said no
A	so they said oh there's some
B	and her name's
A	mm
A	because she's
B	it's very Welsh
A	married now but at the time er yeah she married a Welshman
B	yeah
B	oh really?
B	brilliant isn't it?
A	no it is
A	erm er but she would have been
B	mm
A	she would have been
B	yeah
A	so that's when they said do you know
B	cos it's not a common name is it?
A	not at all
B	cos if it was a
A	one after the other
B	you would just think oh that's a coincidence
A	yeah
B	cos there's so many of us
A	yeah
B	about
A	and it I think they must have asked that the the lecturer must have somehow assumed that that maybe they were sisters
B	yeah
A	as in oh well if one's come so another one's come
B	yeah family tradition
A	why not? you know
B	so it's their mail
A	teachers whatever so she had to say no because technically she had never met my mum so she said no and she didn't want to open up a can of worms to say yes but she did know at that point
B	so that story sounds potentially plausible
A	yeah
B	but the thing is you just never know
A	no
B	this is I really try and bear in mind
A	mm
B	it's so difficult for me cos it goes against my instincts
A	mm
B	I really try to remember that unless I've seen it
A	yeah
B	for myself
A	yeah
B	unfold
A	yeah
B	then I don't know whether it's true or not
A	yeah
B	maybe ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine percent sure it is
A	yeah yeah
B	but you never actually
A	actually know
B	know
A	yeah
B	unless you've witnessed it unfolding
A	yeah
B	with your own senses and your own
A	that's right
B	cognitive processing skills
A	that's exactly yeah
B	cos that story almost it does sound plausible but
A	yeah
B	but it sounds almost a bit too pat doesn't it?
A	yes
B	it sounds almost as if
A	yeah
B	if you were making up a story to illustrate what you wanted to convey
A	yeah
B	that's the story you'd come up with
A	yeah yes it could be
B	it's not natural
A	it isn't quite obvious
B	it's not natural
A	yeah
B	to me to think like that
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	yeah yeah
B	but
A	yeah yeah there is something about it but and then there there are so many cross links you know I mean she went back way back to the eighteen forty-one census but what I find fascinating I quite like these quirky things is that she said that she'd found and and the that census in eighteen forty-one that there was
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about cross links	Neutral
B	oh
A	now my granny would have been
B	cos I was trying to work out this is a bit of a digression
A	yeah
B	how how did everybody come to be in
A	not no erm her first cousin
B	yeah
A	married
B	I've heard that name but I can't remember
A	and moved in
B	the
A	the books
B	and
A	the bookstore people
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	people who
B	apparently they're very famous but I
A	ran yeah they're well they're a publishing family
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	you know erm and er so when
B	cos they were saying what have you never heard of them? and I was saying no sorry I'm really ignorant I've never heard of anything
A	no you but you wouldn't and it's a
B	yeah
A	publishing family so
[ANNOTATION]	person B is not sure about heard anything	Entailment
B	cos I just never understood
A	which is er they're no more
B	how from Wales and Ireland
A	yeah how
A	yes
B	and I did ask and I did pay attention but at the end I was none the wiser
A	no no
B	cos I just couldn't follow
A	I think what happened is that
B	right
A	because she was going through a divorce
B	yeah and it was taboo back then
A	yeah and she'd already spent a lot of time in London having a lot of fun
B	I'm gonna tell you my granny digression later
A	okay
B	just talking about taboo no so carry on cos I I'm I'm engrossed
A	and I think granny could have been getting a little bit wayward in London
B	yes
A	so she needed somewhere with a little bit more family connection
B	yeah
A	but not
B	no that makes perfect sense
A	so
B	so
A	absolutely
B	put a bit of distance between you and the gossip mongers
A	yes that's exactly right
B	and the scandal mongers but don't go anywhere where it's gonna tempt you to
A	yes
B	further scandals
A	yes that's very right or get caught up with something you don't want to get caught up with which was maybe what the backdrop was
B	an unsuitable gentleman
A	yeah cos there were plenty of suitors playing
B	yeah
B	ah so it was cousin
A	yes first cousin
B	granny's cousin?
A	yes first cousin
B	ah
A	they were great friends
B	and why was and so
A	married
B	ah
A	family
B	so the
A	he was the head of the
B	based there for ages
A	yes yes they were
B	a cousin married into the family
A	yeah
B	you see I can understand it when you say it
A	yeah
B	it's actually straightforward isn't it?
A	yeah
B	I understand it perfectly
B	so again when the cousin wanted to
A	yeah
B	not London but not
A	yeah
B	the obvious place would be where there was a family connection
A	yeah
B	which was
A	yeah
A	exactly
B	cos that's where her cousin okay it makes sense
A	yeah yeah
B	I concentrated for about half an hour
B	trying to get to the bottom of that
B	it makes sense yeah
B	cos I heard no I've heard the name
A	yeah
B	it was just I I got that it was a relative
A	yes yeah
B	and that they were real erm
A	oh yeah
B	out and about and in demand
A	she made a point about
B	and the social whirl and
A	yeah
B	yeah but I
A	they were
B	couldn't quite work out who
A	yeah yeah
B	and I didn't realise that
A	yeah
B	I didn't understand that the I didn't understand that
A	yeah yeah and how
B	and that there was er somebody called
A	yeah
B	for
A	I I also don't know how the cousin thing works out that's another branch bit that I don't know
B	yeah but anyway they were cousins
A	so there must have been a brother or sister
B	yeah relatives
A	but though my granny didn't have any brothers or sisters so erm not quite sure how that works out but
B	but in those days and especially certain types of family
A	yeah
B	the typical thing to do would be if you were having a change in your life would be affiliate yourself to
A	exactly
B	a relative
A	yes
B	and I know lots of people who do that now
A	yeah yeah
B	like oh they get divorced
A	yeah
B	they lose their job and they have some kind of crisis and they just oh I'm going to go and live in
A	yeah
B	wherever because well my sister lives there
A	yeah yeah
B	it's normal for some people
A	yeah yeah and
B	it's the last thing but I'd do but
A	it makes perfect sense
B	you know
A	yeah and
B	yeah
A	it's like wow you know
B	well it's lovely as well
A	so she moved her mother up there
B	mm
A	so her mother and also her aunt so auntie
B	yes
A	and then granny would have said to mum now you have your teaching qualification what are you going to do with it and you need to come a little bit closer to me so I can keep an eye on you
B	so this was when granny was maybe
A	granny would have been in her fifties
B	yeah
A	late forties just late forties fifties?
B	so by those standards getting quite staid but by our standards
A	yeah
B	it's young I mean
A	yeah
B	it's our age
A	well er er yeah but I you know I think because she wasn't married and
B	yeah
A	she didn't have any of those trappings
B	no
A	so
B	yeah
A	aunt but I mean really they were alright you know
B	yeah
A	so it was quite a good amount of time
B	they didn't need round the clock care or
A	no
B	you don't have to put your whole life on hold for them
A	yeah no she really got to know
B	so she then moved into the house
A	they er granny bought it outright
B	okay
A	yeah
B	so that's all from your mum's
A	absolutely that's the thing and so mum got a
B	and if you think about it
A	I know you
B	what would they have want and
A	well I know I know that's that's another thing
B	oh that's not for me to say but
A	yeah yeah
B	you know what I mean
A	yeah no I do know I've I've cottoned onto that
B	cos I've been thinking that right from the word go
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	yeah yeah yeah I know I I'm completely aware of it you know I don't think he is though
B	yeah but what would
A	he's er conveniently forgotten about it
B	you know what what would mummy and granny want? and if it wasn't for mum and granny then nobody would be living in that house
A	mm it's not clear what they would have done actually because he had erm they
B	can make an educated guess
B	no
A	because I would have been hard cos he came out of the he chose to come out of the army a little earlier
B	mm
A	and he did have his army pension but that wasn't it they looked to buy somewhere in
B	no
A	so they would have had to have get a huge mortgage
B	yeah
A	so granny made it dead
B	yeah
A	you know erm and to let you know the children come and live with there as well
B	and obviously obviously when you get married obviously you put your destinies together
A	yeah
B	but at the same time
A	yeah yeah
B	there's also your children
A	yeah
B	exactly
A	or security really
B	exactly
A	and she allowed him to put you know this extra bit onto the house
B	yeah
A	to give him a sort of sense of ownership
B	and what would your mother and your granny think about that having these meetings and stuff? I mean
A	god I don't know I have no idea
B	it's weird isn't it? is it weird?
A	yeah
B	to me it's weird not bad weird
A	yeah
B	it's just to me it's weird
A	apparently it's part of the trust thing you know I don't know but
B	but it is emotional because they
A	yeah
B	don't people understand? if I can understand I probably don't understand
A	yeah
B	precisely but I can understand the broad outline
A	yeah
B	and the bare bones
A	yeah
B	in Australia
A	yeah
B	you've come back
A	I know we're finding our feet
B	you've moved into a house that you're used to seeing your mum and your granny in
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	which is why the whole family was in the house in the first place
A	that's right
B	you come back if your mum and granny were alive they'd want to hear every detail about
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	everything oh tell us about your trip
A	yeah
B	let's see the photos how are you feeling
A	that's true
B	how do you feel about being back?
A	yeah mm
B	let's go and do something nice
A	mm
B	let's have a nice chat let's
A	yeah
B	you get none of that
A	yeah
B	you know so what's your plans?
A	yeah
B	you know it's hard it's like a
A	yeah it's
B	emotional rock
A	it's already coming as a judgement
B	hitting you in the chest
A	yeah it's a judgement already
B	and no-one shows any interest
A	yeah yeah well you see what he said to me was erm that he felt like he was being taken advantage of
B	how?
A	and erm he said well I you know I just think it's unhealthy if you know children of your age erm come to live with their parents so erm you know I kind of emotionally kind of reacted to that and I said well
B	but that's your house
A	you know I I don't I don't understand what you mean dad
B	that was your mother's house and your grandmother's house
A	the first thing how are we taking advantage of you?
B	and how big is that house for one guy
A	yeah
B	and one dog?
A	yeah
B	they are a bit mad aren't they?
A	why would you put the baked beans there when they always go here? I said well
A	yeah it's it I said like
B	sorry I'm not being nasty but that's actually
A	well it could be a mistake
B	madness
A	yeah it could have been a mistake it could have been anything I don't really know why the baked beans are there but think about what you're actually saying dad
B	or let's just say you are a bit mental and it matters to you where the baked beans go
A	yeah
B	there are ways and ways of doing things if your dad had said oh
A	yeah
B	would you mind just putting the baked beans here next time
A	yeah
B	you'd have
A	yeah
B	yeah of course dad
A	exactly
B	and how are you today you know
A	yeah
B	there are ways and ways of doing things
A	oh no he just flew off the handle
B	everyone's got their own idiosyncrasies
A	yeah
B	let's call them
A	yeah
B	to be kind
A	that's it that's it yeah
B	but there are ways and ways of talking to people
A	yeah well this is what set the whole thing off
B	and that's your home
A	and he said it's my kitchen and I said it's your kitchen? how is it your kitchen? knowing full well that he'd set up this trust that that was what is being intended
B	but that's rude trust or no trust
A	yeah
B	forget it you you're mum's daughter and your
A	but
B	grandmother's granddaughter
A	but he's been hammering on to me about this whole trust thing
B	that's obscene actually
A	so erm that was
B	but again I'm sure he didn't mean any harm
A	firstly no he didn't
B	but doesn't he understand how insensitive
A	he doesn't oh no he he
B	that is and how hurtful?
A	really doesn't care really doesn't care
B	but that house is enormous
A	yeah
B	I mean this place is for me enormous it's far too ridiculously enormous but I mean
A	but yeah
B	compared
A	I said well what do you think mummy and granny would have said to that?
B	quite
A	and I kept bringing that up
B	quite
A	and of course that sort of sent him up even more loopy but you know I think I got the point across probably
B	but he was married to your mum for all those years
A	I know but he's just become completely hypocritical
B	can't imagine how your mum would have
A	because
B	reacted
A	granny let him
B	your mum would want you
A	stay
B	I know
A	with his wife well obviously her daughter but with the children
B	it's more like he's this is sounds awful but it's more as if he's the imposter
A	yeah
B	you've got the family line from granny
A	yeah
B	to mum
A	yeah
B	to
A	yeah
B	it's not
A	and now it's his
B	my kitchen
A	my kitchen my everything my house
B	if my mum and dad had stayed together
A	yeah
B	if my mum and dad had stayed together and my mum died
A	yeah
B	in what had been my family home
A	yeah
B	and he started talking about my kitchen
A	yeah it's just absolutely
B	you could have knocked me down with a feather I mean my dad was mad
B	but even
A	yeah yeah it's very odd and so you do wonder
B	and you're not harming the kitchen it's not as if you've
A	well
B	made a bonfire in the kitchen
A	well that's right
B	and
A	this is right and I said to him and I said well what's going on dad? and he said well as far as I'm concerned you're you're invited guests
B	seriously?
A	have we have we been invited to
B	word for word?
A	for yeah word for word I said how long have we been invited? oh well er probably after Christmas
B	I said oh great you know how would mum and gran feel that you're actually basically turfing us out after after
B	so that
A	Christmas
B	house cos it's probably worth an absolute fortune I'm sure it
A	yeah
B	you know
B	you and I just probably looked it up on
B	no but I don't I don't know about things like this but what I mean is
A	Location Location Location
B	well what I mean is you know
B	there a there's a lovely house with tonnes of room and tonnes of bedrooms and tonnes of
A	yeah
B	bathrooms and tonnes of space
A	yeah
B	and you and
A	well
B	nine to five job and a weekend job to pay some rent on some little flat somewhere
A	well well well I
B	I mean if you chose to
A	yes
B	then that's all well and good
A	yes yeah
B	and that would be brilliant and I think it probably would be
A	yeah
B	healthy
A	yeah
B	but it needs to come from you
A	yeah
B	and you've only just
A	only just really arrived
B	come from Australia a few months ago
A	yeah I don't think he's cottoned on to any of that at all
B	and it's the emotional impact and the emotional connotations of
A	mm
B	coming back into that home where
A	mm
B	for all those years you looked at that chair and
A	mm
B	and your mum was in it
A	mm
B	for all those years you looked at that chair and your
A	yeah
B	granny was in it
A	yeah
B	that's what
A	so that's the worst argument we've had
B	but did he back down or
A	pretty bad sorry?
B	he did he back down and apologise?
A	oh no
B	but did he understand he'd hurt you or
B	genuinely didn't understand?
A	no
B	this is what I think
A	none
B	you see I think your dad and
A	yeah
B	I don't think they set out to be cruel
A	no
B	I don't think they've set out to be unkind I don't think they set out to even be selfish I just think it's something
A	I I think you're right I I really like the way you expressed it
B	it's like a personality disorder or
A	oblivious oblivious is a really
B	oblivious
A	good adjective to describe them
B	cos there are people who get pleasure from hurting people
A	yeah yeah
B	like sadistic people
A	yeah
B	they like to make you suffer
A	yeah
B	they like to manipulate just to show they're
A	just to see yeah
B	I don't think they're like that
A	yeah
B	I think they
A	yeah
B	it's just a whole different world view
A	no but he I mean he
B	and a whole different perspective
A	just said to me I'm your father so don't ask me and don't question me don't question my authority is that what he was saying and I said really dad? I thought we were friends
B	so you're a
A	apparently
B	so you're there sort of under sufferance
A	yeah and
B	and out of the kindness of his heart
A	I did know that
B	he's
A	mm
B	allowing you to stay
A	mm
B	till Christmas
A	but he doesn't want to be taken advantage of
B	and he's being taken advantage of by
A	something there has been you know
B	but how is he being taken advantage of?
A	I've asked him that and he couldn't tell me
B	I mean you don't you don't make mess you're not
A	no
B	bad tempered
A	no in fact I've helped
B	you're not
A	around the house
B	I'm sure you have
A	I've cleared the attic we do the we do all the sorts of things
B	yeah yeah
A	that we know that we you know that you know
B	I mean even if you didn't
A	normal things
B	I don't think
A	yeah
B	that that would justify it but
A	no
B	you're no you know you're not costing him anything
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said you have not cost him any thing	Entailment
A	no
B	either financially or
A	well I've just said to him listen I know that electricity is expensive and er I know that it's going to be coming to winter and please let me know what we owe you
B	well yeah
A	because we'll pay for it you know there's absolutely no problem there erm er and even before when we left to go to Australia we were paying a little bit of rent for energy mostly
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	most of it's energy based but that when mum was alive
B	but if your mum was alive she'd be just so happy to have you there
A	well she would and he's clearly not
B	but he's not interested I find it I find it so strange it's I think I said it in the email as well
A	yeah
B	I find it really weird not to be interested in other people
A	well this is it so
B	cos I'm interested in everyone even people I find a real plonker
A	yeah
B	or a pain in the arse I find people fascinating
A	I well I mean I ask him questions about his everything that he does and so
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	erm anyway
B	yeah
A	we're meant to be having this bottle of champagne I personally don't feel like celebrating
B	no
A	but I will fall inline
B	yeah yeah
A	because you know you're here and I'll make an effort and
B	yeah
A	so will
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is feeling so bad about the things that Person C said	Contradiction
B	we haven't even mentioned
A	mm
B	sorry but poor
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	he's such a mild I mean
A	oh god
B	I mean I know I don't know
A	I mean
B	he's such a mild guy
A	yeah yeah it's
B	he's so
A	it's so hard for him
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that it is hard for him	Neutral
B	he strikes me as so un-confrontational and just so
A	yeah oh it's
B	gentle
A	so hard for him to understand
B	and just
A	that it's
B	just plods around doesn't he?
A	yeah
B	just
A	yeah he
B	exuding good will
A	he really can't get his head round though which I completely understand
B	I mean it's awful for you
[ANNOTATION]	He did not want to confront the waiter when he got the wrong plate.	Neutral
A	you know
B	but at least you've had a bit of
A	well yeah I've had years of practice
B	yeah
A	you know so
B	but
A	mm
B	oh I didn't know
[ANNOTATION]	A has known him for a long time.	Entailment
B	oh
A	meeting all these people that he's met online
B	okay
A	and he's now finally met up with them face to face and erm so that was all a good little project that he did there
B	okay
A	and now he's in Spain and he's learning Spanish
B	okay
A	and he's you know erm looking around and
[ANNOTATION]	He is currently in Argentina and he is learning Spanish.	Contradiction
B	I didn't know what was happening with
A	he's going to
B	okay so he's
A	and then he'll go to
B	oh good
A	yeah
B	so he'll come back in a good mood hopefully
A	yes and with some of the his little goals ticked off whatever it is
[ANNOTATION]	He does not like to confront other people.	Entailment
B	well yeah
A	that he wants to do but most importantly
B	so make people happy isn't it
A	I gave him a push and I said
B	he needs a push and I said
[ANNOTATION]	He went to Spain by plane.	Neutral
A	he needs a push I think
B	go
B	yeah
A	go for yourself
B	yeah
A	but also go for now because
B	kick off
A	kick off
[ANNOTATION]	He will use the internet for the first time next week.	Contradiction
B	and you don't wanna be in the crossfire
A	yeah
B	cos the poor guy I mean
A	yeah it's really horrible for him
B	he just seems like someone who wouldn't be able to cope at all
A	yeah and he and he finds
B	and I mean that as a
A	but also he really finds it hard to talk to my dad
B	but it's actually
A	cos my dad makes it quite hard
B	it's really emotionally
A	yeah
B	draining
A	yeah
B	even for me
A	it is
B	even just
A	yeah
B	like the couple of three or four times I've been there as an outsider
A	yeah
B	no-one's been horrible to me or anything but it it's it's really
A	it's very
B	erm
A	draining if you're not really knowing where it's come from
B	yeah
A	as well
B	it's like just
A	yeah exactly
B	and and also
A	you know
B	because because there's no harm meant
A	mm
B	you can't even console yourself by thinking you know the bastards or anything
A	yeah
B	no because it's not
A	no it's not
B	there's nothing
A	it's not it's not mal
B	there's nothing to be critical of
A	or mal-intended
B	there's nothing to
A	yeah yeah
B	feel sorry for yourself about there's nothing to feel
A	no
B	hard done by about it's just that's the way it is
A	it's just the way it is yeah yeah
B	but it's it's sort of full on you know there's no erm
A	oh it's very full on it's really
B	there's no consideration of how you might feel or anything
A	oh god none
B	luckily I feel fine
A	yeah yeah
B	but I think if I was most people I know
A	yeah
B	I think I'd be
A	yeah
B	traumatised and devastated and need therapy
A	well this is what I actually said to
B	you know
A	I said I don't want you to be traumatised you need to be my backup support
B	cos I'm okay
A	so
B	in that type of situation
B	but they did traumatise me but
A	if they're traumatising me that's okay but it's not okay
B	but the next day but but I'm the sort of person
A	but yeah
B	the next day I'll be alright again
A	yeah mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	it won't actually damage my
A	no
B	soul
A	no it won't no
B	yeah
A	not locked out you know but he needs to be outside and objective which
B	and also
A	and he was getting
B	drawn in
A	because I was pulling him in
B	yeah because you can't help it
A	because I couldn't help it
B	no
A	yeah
B	and also you don't wanna have the added emotional pressure of feeling responsible for
A	well
B	and feeling you've got to protect him and reassure him
A	that's right
B	and comfort him
A	exactly it was having an effect on our relationship
B	yeah well god I should think so
A	and that's when I said right no
B	I should think so
A	our relationship is positive
B	yeah
A	it's great
B	and that comes first
A	let's just keep on going with
B	yeah
A	let's just see how far we can push it
B	yeah
A	you know and I'll deal with this yeah I'll
B	but ultimately
A	I'll deal with it but
B	I know it sounds silly
A	you know
B	but ultimately like all these things
A	mm
B	ultimately
A	no they don't
B	all these things
A	no you're right
B	like
A	yeah
B	oh so what are you going to do
A	yeah I know I know
B	and so where are you gonna live and what job are you gonna do and what job's
A	yeah
B	doesn't actually matter
B	it's like you're a human being with another human
A	but you it's it is
B	and you're married
A	it's completely right what you've just said because I sent out this email
B	you know you're not gonna starve in this country
A	no no no exactly not
B	you know even if
A	no
B	hypothetically your dad threw you into the street
A	yeah
B	no-one in this country starves
A	yeah which he won't but yeah
B	we don't end up
A	yeah
B	in the
A	yeah
B	workhouse
A	that's right yeah
B	what's the worst that can happen?
A	yeah exactly
B	you know who cares about
B	all of a sudden it's all a bit nonsense
A	no
B	okay
A	well before I got married you know
B	yeah because now
B	I'm not being funny but now
A	my husband is my confidante
B	yeah exactly
A	you know so
B	exactly
A	yeah mm
B	I think most people confide in their mums if they're lucky enough to have one their grannies if they're lucky enough to have one
A	yeah
B	their sisters if they're lucky enough to have one
A	yeah
B	their
A	partner whoever
B	whatever they call it
A	yeah or with with
B	if they're lucky enough to have one
A	with friends
B	or their friends
A	mm
B	the father daughter relationship's different
A	mm
B	and
A	no they're not no no no
B	I've never seen anything more
A	yeah
B	antithetical to communication
A	yeah
B	in my entire life
A	yeah they're appalling at it yeah
B	but there's no communication
A	yeah no
B	but they probably think that's communication
A	yeah
B	and one of them does a big monologue
A	oh that's right
B	about
A	mm and then
B	something that's happened to them
A	you know someone
B	and then the other one does a massive monologue
A	will pick holes then an argument
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah mm
B	but that's not communicating
A	no it's not it's it's more like some sort of weird kind of debate so
B	I don't know what it is yeah
A	anyway I thought right well if I'm going to take
B	yeah
A	to see what happens
B	and he probably meant well
A	yeah
B	again
A	and I thought why not?
B	mm
A	you know it's the it's another perspective
B	nothing ventured nothing gained
A	nothing gained absolutely so I wrote this email as an opportune moment because
B	oh god really?
A	dad's in
B	I don't know how you cope
B	yeah
A	about to go to erm
B	yeah
A	we won't see him
B	it's so mad though the the things that you're reduced to
A	I know
B	an email
A	had sent an email to my dad to tell him what he was doing in
B	everyone does everything by email
A	cos he told my dad but my dad was on his
B	yeah yeah
A	but when when are you coming back? he said well I'm not now like
B	but this is the thing about
A	I'm staying now for
B	trying to communicate with people who drink they don't remember anything
A	no so I thought this is brilliant
B	they say things they don't remember saying it
A	I have sent an email yeah
B	you say things they don't remember you saying them
A	mm
B	it's like being with an Alzheimer's patient
A	yeah oh I know
B	really literally
A	no
B	as if it never happened
A	so I wrote this email which was I even told them about the book
B	yeah
A	I told them about going to meet
B	all the kinds of things if they'd asked you
A	yeah
B	you'd have told them
A	yes exactly and I said wouldn't it be nice if we could all keep in contact and just update each everyone er now and then you know to sort of keep everyone
B	yeah
A	in the loop
B	yeah
A	as a family sort of thing and you know what?
B	and not even
A	absolutely
B	reply oh thanks
A	no
B	kiss
A	nothing
B	how long does that take?
A	not not even the two of us in the house knocking around oh I got your email I had no idea you know blah-blah-blah no it's a point now that he's making
B	but you actually went to the time
A	mm
B	you actually went to the trouble
A	mm
B	and invested your time
A	but the intention is let's keep each other
B	because you were trying to take
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	before you were married
A	yeah
B	so you're thinking that may or may not be true but nothing ventured
A	why not?
B	nothing gained
A	yeah
B	so then you go and waste
A	yeah
B	a couple of hours of your time
A	mm
B	typing away
A	mm
B	and then reading it through
A	yeah
B	and checking that all your
A	yeah
B	apostrophes are in the right place
A	yeah
B	send cathartically
A	yeah
B	waiting for the feedback
A	yeah and nothing
B	not even feedback
A	nothing at all
B	but like oh
A	or just an acknowledgement
B	of spelling it out and you know
A	yeah
B	but I'm sorry I'm sorry it is really weird this communicating by email
A	I know it is but if that's what I'm reduced to
B	no I know I don't mean it's not coming from you
A	yeah
B	you have to but it is
A	it's it it's
B	really weird
A	it's what I'm and the pressure
B	what about
A	I'm under I think
B	what about
A	you know
B	what about those emails what was it now? I can't remember there was something where I got some of the emailing thing
A	oh no about erm
B	I can't remember what it was now
A	Dobby sitting
B	yeah
A	that was when we came back you know it was like
B	but it was almost as if
A	what you said you were
B	I don't
A	gonna do but we didn't even know that you were going to know that
B	but I don't think it was
A	you were gonna do it
B	this
A	yeah
B	but my initial reaction when I saw it like almost your dad's trying to like publicly shame you in a way
A	yeah
B	I don't think that was what it was
A	yeah
B	but I thought well why I don't want to
A	and also that Friday evening my dad was so hurtful to me he actually said things that even
B	yeah
A	that is it okay? as far as I'm concerned I've just labelled it
B	but I think erm
A	I know what it I know what it is but
B	I think they are both abusive
A	yeah
B	emotionally abusive
A	yeah
B	I think I was trying to think of friends of mine
A	yeah
B	cos the thing is you know my dad was mad?
A	yeah
B	I'm not saying that nastily
A	yeah
B	cos I love my dad but he was completely mad and violent and
A	yeah
B	all these types of things so I've got a resilience
A	yeah
B	it doesn't mean I'm not upset I am really upset by everything but I'm somehow okay because
A	yeah
B	I grew up with it and I told you my brother's mad I just described him
A	yeah
B	earlier
A	yeah
B	and I've had lots of those type of situations
A	yes yes
B	and it's almost as if if you've survived it then you know you're gonna be alright cos you survived in once
A	yeah
B	and you're kind of confident oh I'll be alright
A	yeah
B	but I was thinking like most of my friends I haven't got very many friends but the friends I have got
A	yeah
B	I was thinking if they'd been sitting in that sitting room as I had or sitting in that restaurant in
A	yeah
B	I think they would have described that as emotional abuse
A	yeah
B	I didn't experience it as
A	yeah
B	emotional abuse
A	yeah
B	but I think
A	but it could
B	technically it was
A	could have been
B	and I think it fulfilled
A	yeah
B	all the criteria
A	yeah
B	of emotional abuse
A	yeah
B	basically making someone feel really uncomfortable
A	mm mm
B	and just sort of
A	and pointing
B	banging into them
A	to yeah
B	and challenging everything and
A	yeah
B	not just the accepting that you've got one point of view and the other person's got another point of view
A	yeah
B	and just not letting it go and just keep going on and because the other person's polite and they're a guest they obviously can't really say anything
A	yeah that's right
B	and just making someone spell something out again and again
A	mm
B	and just contradicting
A	mm
B	everything
A	mm
B	and just
A	mm
B	it's like a barrage
A	it is it is a barrage yeah
B	and the other person not
A	no
B	sticking up for you or anything
A	no
B	there's no sense
A	no
B	that
A	no oh no none
B	and just
A	yeah
B	and don't get me wrong I don't
A	yeah
B	mind
A	yeah
B	but I was just thinking I honestly think most people I know who are not woozy
A	yeah
B	people none of them are
A	yeah
B	woozy people
A	yeah
B	but I think they would have
A	yeah
B	described that
A	said hang on a minute
B	people
A	what's going on here?
B	who have studied psychology
A	yeah
B	and I think that fulfilled the criteria
A	mm
B	of what constitutes
A	mm
B	emotional abuse
A	yeah and and that was really
B	and just keep on saying why do you think that? and then you
A	well
B	you're politely trying to explain why
A	he just said unkind things to me
B	and while you're explaining they just repeat why
A	yeah
B	but you're actually in the process of trying to answer the question
A	yeah
B	but
A	but won't give you a chance yeah
B	but you see it's
A	yeah
B	drinkers
A	yeah and this is it
B	that wouldn't happen if people were sober
A	he got upset
B	would you like to share what it was or is it too excruciating?
A	well there was one or two
B	you don't have to
A	erm well no there was one about erm so there's this seventieth birthday party going on which is friends of my dad's who are friends of my dad and erm so he said he said erm oh well
B	so what he invited one child and not the other?
A	well
B	that's weird
A	that's just what he said so
B	yeah
A	wouldn't read too much into how
B	no
A	whether actually he is invited or not but this is what he he said
B	well he wouldn't wanna go anyway
B	I wouldn't have thought
A	but
B	why?
A	and
B	I wouldn't have
A	no and in fact
B	not in a nasty way
A	that's what
B	not not not being personal
A	that's that's it's actually what
B	but why would they
A	what
B	you know
B	but my friends who have got grown up kids
A	yeah
B	if I'm gonna go for a meal with them I don't I don't mind their kids being there
A	yeah
B	it would be fun but I don't actively really want to hang out with their kids
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	and anyway it's it's not their birthday party
B	no
A	so
B	just exhausting
A	and he did this whole thing about I think you're just being kind to your sister but I know the true story
B	but that's very vicious
A	begrudgingly
B	and snide and
A	so poor
B	this is now cruelty
A	this is now something else
B	it's cruelty it may not be intentional cruelty in fact I don't think it is
A	right
B	but it is cruelty
A	and I
B	even if it's not meant like that
A	I'm not I'm not drunk you know at all really you know I had a glass or two of champagne
B	god
A	and a chat and I said actually
B	sounds horrible
A	yeah okay no I now I do understand what's going on
B	can I say something just
A	yeah
B	this is where I have trouble with life
A	yeah
B	because of the way I am
A	right
B	just because I can't usually be bothered
A	yeah
B	but when it's for someone else I become the most assertive person in the world
A	yeah yeah
B	and my problem is I don't think I expect anything of anyone I think I expect less of anybody on this
A	yeah
B	planet than anyone on this planet I've ever met
A	yeah
B	in my entire life
A	yeah
B	but one thing I do expect it never happens but I do expect I expect someone to stick up for me
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	it's not a criticism
A	mm
B	it's just to do with different people and
A	mm
B	their expectations if I was in your position I would have expected both
A	yeah
B	in unison when your dad got onto the second sentence to go stop speaking to
A	yeah
B	not not swear at him
A	yeah
B	not be rude not be disrespectful but dad please don't speak to
A	yeah
B	in front of me
A	yeah
B	that's what I'd expect
A	yeah
B	and it never happens
A	happens no it doesn't
B	everyone's so spineless
A	yes yeah
B	I've been in
B	those situations so many times you totally lose respect for someone
A	yeah yeah it's really hard yeah
B	even if I couldn't stand someone even if someone was my mortal enemy
A	yeah
B	if someone started laying into them unfairly I would
A	yeah
B	immediately
A	yeah
B	I'd say stop it
A	yeah
B	and I
A	yeah
B	and I have
A	yeah
B	and I'm so erm
A	yeah
B	can't be bothered to engage half the time
A	but on that on that that yeah
B	it's like a sense of justice
A	yes
B	I remember erm
A	yeah
B	I
A	yeah
B	and I've been in so many situations where the people who are supposed to think I'm so great and have such loyalty and love for me and everything they just sit there like a
A	yeah
B	pussy basically
A	just yeah
B	that's what my students would say
A	yeah
B	you know like
A	yeah and no well I acknowledged that and I
B	but I really have got unrealistic expectations people just
A	that that's also where I am at
B	but it's not as if I expect it to happen
A	yeah
B	I don't expect anything else and I don't expect anything else
A	yeah
B	you just expect that if you're under attack someone defends you
A	yeah
B	wouldn't you?
A	you would yeah
B	I don't know why I still expect it
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah and that's what I realised that it's probably better for
B	oh poor
A	I know because
B	I know I don't really know
A	because I mean I'm sure he'd love to challenge my father
B	but he just seems so so mild
A	but
B	no but he's a guest as well
A	but he but he
B	he sort of is and he isn't
A	but he's a different dynamic
B	yeah
A	it's a very different dynamic
B	and you presumably until these last months presumably you didn't really know your father not really
A	no and and the other thing is he didn't really want to go back to
B	no well why would he?
A	yeah
B	just gonna quickly go to the loo
A	yeah yeah go for it
A	yeah so it's oh well it's I'll just stop this for a minute
B	oh yeah sorry
A	but it it is it's
B	oh gosh I completely forgot that was
A	oh wow wonderful
B	and if it was up to me I never would have collected owls
A	yeah I
B	and I don't want to get rid of the owls
A	I know
B	I had them all in a box to take to the charity shop and
A	couldn't do it
B	I just took them all out of the box
A	yeah yeah I know I've inherited my mum's elephants which I always liked and always played with anyway but erm
B	I like clutter
A	yeah
B	it's awful I'd like to be
A	yeah
B	the sort of person who didn't like clutter I'd like to be the sort of person who liked minimalism
A	yeah
B	they cheer me up when I look at them
A	oh yes
B	yeah
A	yeah and I was
B	I just think it's really pretty
A	those two er postcards you sent from erm
B	oh they've finally arrived? cos I just assumed I thought
A	right well well no they got
B	oh they came?
A	but they were there's a little stamp on it no there's a little sticker
B	yeah
A	on both of them one to my dad obviously
B	yeah
A	and one to me that says misdirected to Thailand
B	oh gosh cos when did I come I came back like six weeks ago
A	yeah ages ago
B	I came back in September and
A	I know and then of course Dobby got them so it's really funny
B	so now it's been via Thailand and it's all teeth marks?
A	it is and and also Dobby just took the bits where the stamp was so we could actually
B	oh that's so funny
A	read it but
B	oh that's so funny
A	it was so funny so there's the bit with the boobs and everything and I was like you know
A	that's just the bit missing and oh at least it wasn't the head that's missing it's that bit
B	oh Dobby
A	er so dad wanted me to say thank you very much for the postcard
B	oh I love Dobby
A	yeah
B	oh Dobby's so nice
B	yeah
A	there's the saving grace is Dobby
B	god what would it be like without Dobby?
A	oh it would be silent
B	I've spent I've spent like hours sitting on that sofa not
A	yeah just stroking Dobby
B	it's actually nice
A	yeah
B	it's actually nice
A	yeah it's lovely
B	no-one invites my opinion even if I wanted to give it I wouldn't get a chance anyway
A	no
B	cos it's
B	it's actually nice you know
B	I just go into a little reverie
B	you know almost like transcendental
A	yes sort of a medication
B	yeah
A	he's loving it
B	now would you like coffee or squash or tea or beer or
A	oh I think I'll have a beer why not?
B	shall we have a beer?
A	I think after having that conversation I feel like I need one
B	it's a bit a bit harrowing
A	well
B	we'll go we'll go and get some food later
A	yeah so it's where is that from Burma?
B	oh this is one of my dad's erm it's from Sabah Indonesia the
A	it's Indonesian is it?
B	the yeah apparently
A	wow
B	I really should have got rid of that as well there's all this that I didn't get rid of
A	that's absolutely fantastic
B	erm ship Cartagena Columbia they're all they're they're not very they haven't been very well cared for
A	I love them
B	they're nice aren't they? go and have a look they're
A	yeah
B	a bit they're a bit erm I don't know the word
A	what's it called?
B	they're a bit old
A	wow wow wow
A	so he obviously really liked collecting things then?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so he travelled a lot?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	you see that's why
B	it's like oh no no
A	yes it I I I wanna get my milk my money's worth but erm so just tell me off er tell me to turn it off tell tell me to turn it off any time
B	no no I don't mind
A	erm but yeah that's what I miss about
B	glass or bottle?
A	erm that's fine
B	this?
A	yeah thanks
B	what I really miss about
B	yeah
A	I mean everything
A	just had to go you know when mum died it was
B	but you might like to have them there
A	well there was things that I you know moved in my direction and took with me but there was so many things so many things
B	what I find perplexing is your your dad thinks of that as his house
A	yeah now it is yeah
B	and you and
A	yeah yeah
B	whereas I think of it as all three of your house
A	yeah but interesting though
B	to the extent to which you want it to be
A	er
B	you know
A	right and interestingly when mum and gran were there
B	because the house came from your
A	I know
B	it would have been different if the house had come from his parents
A	yes
B	that would be a bit different
A	yeah
B	I know it shouldn't
A	yeah but the dynamic always was was that when we moved in erm
B	well do it then
A	but your mum won't let me your
B	but then why would you even
A	interplay between
B	mention it then?
A	it's not my house really and he said well I did put so and so much money into it and I have
B	oh well well done
A	paid for the you know extension
B	sorry
A	so why shouldn't I be able to put a tree here? and I said well maybe the tree shouldn't go there maybe the tree should go somewhere else I'm not so sure
B	but
A	but you know and it was always this thing and
B	power
A	now I feel like
B	it was power struggle isn't it?
A	yes now mum's gone
B	now you've taken over
A	bumph
B	the role unwittingly
A	yes and I thought
B	you've been cast in the role of
A	cheers and he's and he's
B	cheers
A	already called me
B	I'd love to have I mean I wouldn't like to know actually but I'd love to know what it was actually like for your mum and dad or for you mum
A	I would say it was probably all bloody awful
B	so would I
A	really awful
B	so would I I was thinking about that
A	mm
B	and again no ill-will intended
A	no no
B	and no harm meant but it is it's so
A	but I think it would have been
B	emotional
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	a barrage
A	yeah she really stood up to him
B	and it's just so telling
A	but I think over the years towards the last part
B	I just don't see the point in standing up because
A	no
B	nothing's achieved
A	yeah well it wasn't in the end
B	no
A	yeah
B	if
A	yeah
B	then I will stand up
A	yeah
B	for myself but really
A	yeah
B	there'd be absolutely no point
A	no no and I've tried
B	I think I told you
A	all my life to stand up to my father
B	there's no point
A	yeah
B	banging your head against the wall
A	yeah
B	I think I told you in the email when I for me this is really brave cos I'm the kind of person that I think you should be polite to people's parents and stuff I said really nicely I said oh I don't mean to be rude but we've actually already had this
A	yeah
B	exact same conversation
A	yeah
B	he goes well I think we need to have it again
A	yeah that's a typical response yeah
B	but I was thinking maybe he and
A	no I don't think they do and actually think you're also quite right is that that this word oblivious is
B	but it's like it was not
A	because I want to be you know
B	really my preferred choice of subject
A	yeah
B	the first time round but
A	yeah
B	please not again because
A	yeah
B	I'm just gonna say exactly what I said last time and you're gonna say exactly because
A	yeah
B	we both think what we think
A	yeah and what happened after that when you told him that after he said
B	we had to have the whole conversation again
A	oh oh god
B	almost word for word from the last time
A	it's like a script
B	yeah
A	oh my god
B	but it was hilarious
A	that that's freaky
B	I thought if my mum was here
A	yeah
B	just be in hysterics well I think we need to have it again
B	it wasn't that no we didn't
A	no not tonight
B	it wasn't like how dare you say that
B	or don't be so rude it was just like
A	forceful
B	yeah and I was thinking well you're not gonna remember it this time either
A	no
B	but there is a really funny side
A	yeah
B	but it's a funny side if you can get on the train the next day
A	yes and leave it and that's
B	yeah
A	and say oh well whatever
B	and if
A	yeah
B	there's none of that sort of dynamic and none of that tension
A	yeah
B	and none of that past
A	yeah
B	and none of that baggage as they say
A	yeah
B	nowadays
A	yeah but it was quite funny because I started all this yoga stuff this week cos it's like forty pounds for unlimited yoga for a month so
B	oh
A	I've been doing everything and it's like
B	oh yeah
A	as far as I can I've been yoga this yoga that twice a er twice a day and already I've sort of cottoned on to a few things and also the instructors erm first one asked me oh erm do you do you sit at the sit at the computer a lot and I thought no actually I don't but I said yes because I just thought that maybe if I said yes then you know they'd be able to sort of help my body get into some kind of posture or something
B	yeah I see what you mean
A	so I just said yes
B	yeah
A	as a shorthand to yes something's wrong I acknowledge it
B	yeah
A	erm so they were right fine so they were you know helping me get more into the thing I thought oh god I actually haven't really spent that much at the computer I wonder what's going on there? and then another one said something like oh you've got very tight erm hamstrings or something like this and I said oh yes I think it's because I run he said no but is that because you sit at the computer a lot?
B	it's so funny yeah just say something tell them what they wanna hear
A	yeah
B	divert hostility
A	this is
B	avoid confrontation
A	and they've all be lovely about it you know but I just thought well I'll just say yeah and then I thought to myself
B	no
A	as an example I finished my job in December
B	yeah
A	and I've really been on the road
B	yeah
A	having so much fun
B	yeah
A	doing all sorts of things
B	exactly
A	with my body swimming
B	but that's also what makes it so hard which I don't think anyone appreciates
A	oh no no
B	has
A	no
B	even thought about that
A	oh god no no no but just to finish that bit so
B	yeah
A	there's something going on with my body that it's almost like somebody who spends twelve or thirteen hours a day
B	yeah because you're so tense
A	and that's when I thought well
B	cos you're so tense
A	I am so tense
B	cos you're trying to protect yourself
A	I'm really tense yes I think it is that
B	and I think in the olden days there was a different frame of reference and there was a different vocabulary and a different terminology and different expectations about everything in the olden days it would have just been oh well that's how things are
A	yeah
B	but now that we inhabit this psycho world
A	yeah
B	these things are abuse
A	yeah
B	they are
A	yeah
B	I mean it's all a matter of definition and it's not
A	yeah and it's all relative
B	the semantics
A	that's right
B	to some extent but
A	yeah yeah
B	I do think nowadays
A	yeah
B	the accepted opinion
A	mm mm would be
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I bet you if I did a psychology NVQ or something
A	yeah
B	module one
A	yeah
B	it would give you in er ten bullet points
A	yes yeah
B	and I bet you you've got all ten of them
A	yeah yeah no wonder my body's feeling like this
B	yeah
A	you know and now I know that it's just him and I in the house so there is that sort of added thing but I'm aware of
B	thank god for Dobby
A	well I know
B	thank god for walking Dobby
A	but I'm also really aware of what's going on you know so I suppose
B	yeah
A	in a sense
B	you've got the insight
A	I've got the yoga thing going on
B	whereas no-one else has
A	as well
B	no but no-one else has no-one else
A	and er and she said oh you know do this so that you feel rooted and grounded right yeah I'm gonna definitely try and feel that
B	yeah
A	now we've got to sort of move some blockages here and round in a bit and I'm going yes I wanna move those bits so I'm kind of thinking well in a way I'm trying to help myself
B	yeah and it's just survival strategy
A	I find myself in the situation of coping
B	coping mechanisms
A	yeah
B	all those clichés
A	whatever yeah
B	yeah whatever gets you through
A	yeah exactly
B	it doesn't matter what it is
A	yeah gets me out of the house
B	yeah
B	I mean it doesn't matter if I mean even if it was a cult
A	yeah
B	you know just anything
A	yeah
B	just to
A	exactly
B	put some distance between you
A	I thought of
B	yeah but I honestly honestly just to
A	yeah
B	be around people
A	mm
B	who respond to you in such a way that you realise I'm actually quite a likeable person
A	yeah
B	and I don't have any major personality
A	yeah
B	issues because everybody else who you come into contact with loves you
A	yeah ah it's funny isn't it?
B	I told you I saw
B	really briefly
A	yeah yeah
B	oh my goodness
A	yeah
B	oh
A	yeah oh wow
B	she's so nice she's knowing and
A	I bet
B	well he
A	this sort of thing
B	he was he was outside with one of them smoking I think
A	right
B	and then so I was talking to one of them and then he went outside with the other one so we I only ever
A	didn't really get a chance
B	no
A	to sort of
B	but it was really funny completely unprompted
A	yeah yeah
B	you know
A	oh that's nice I should really get to see them yeah
B	but I just think you just need to bear in mind that
A	yeah
B	other people
A	yeah
B	respond to you in a very positive way
A	they do yeah
B	with huge warmth
A	yes
B	and liking
A	yeah yeah
B	and approval
A	yeah
B	and without any criticism and without any erm
A	no
B	things to quibble about or
A	yeah
B	anything to criticise or
A	yeah
B	but I think it's really important to bear that in mind
A	yeah
B	because sometimes
A	yeah
B	you do start buying into other peoples
A	true
B	perceptions
A	yeah yeah
B	especially if you're exposed to that person all the time
A	yeah
B	especially if you're under the same roof
A	yeah
B	you almost take on
A	yeah you do
B	their view of you
A	yeah
B	and you start thinking
A	oh I felt like that exactly
B	maybe I am taking advantage
A	yeah
B	maybe I am disrupting everything with the baked bean
B	replacement
A	I mean all these things about you know whatever dad's got in mind for me or
B	yeah
A	you know this wonderful sort of
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know when we arrived back erm and
B	yeah
A	you're now beginning to sound like
B	I know exactly
A	your father
B	I think
A	yeah
B	I think
A	he does
B	becomes like a
A	yeah
B	it's almost as if your dad's living vicariously
A	yeah
B	through
A	yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	to allowing your dad
A	mm
B	to live vicariously through him
A	mm well I think that's what generally
B	it's really weird
A	annoys my father
B	because
A	is that I'm not allowing that to happen
B	no
A	yet no
B	but
A	yeah
B	enables them
A	yeah
B	but acting really admiringly towards
A	yeah
B	all these things that are not real
A	yeah
B	you know so then
A	yeah
B	that encourages
A	more of that
B	even more like that
A	that's right yeah
B	but I think it's almost as if
A	yeah
B	speaking it's almost as if
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah yeah
B	this like oh being so important and everything
A	yeah yeah I I I see it like that yeah
B	it's almost as if that's the only way you can get approval
A	yes it is
B	is by sort of
A	it is the only way you can get approval
B	being this kind of but it's all fake
A	yeah
B	you know it's
A	yeah
B	and none of it's real
A	yeah
B	and even if it was real so what?
A	yeah it doesn't matter yeah
B	but your dad loves it
A	genuinely
B	your dad loves it oh yes
A	yeah
B	yeah cos you don't play along
A	no
B	but I think that's also perhaps a factor in why
A	yeah yep
B	because he's so used to only getting approval if you act
A	yeah
B	like all this fake stuff
A	yes
B	that he thinks
A	yeah
B	that no-one's gonna like him if he's just
A	yeah the I
B	tells the truth
A	that's that's definitely true and then anyway from my perspective
B	yeah
A	that is yeah
B	cos I tried to say
A	I mean I've looked at stories
B	I try to say like you're very likeable
A	yeah
B	why do you make things up all the time?
A	yeah
B	it's embarrassing
A	yeah
B	but really funny things
A	even more so now perhaps
B	but really funny things
A	he's more insecure
B	but for about the first
A	you know
B	for the first few months I knew him I just thought everything was true
A	right
B	and being on the university rowing team and going to Oxford to study medicine and doing the Duke of Edinburgh and
A	god exhausting
B	being chosen to represent England in the debating club or something I don't know like all these things
A	oh
B	but it was all true
A	right
B	and they were actually quite nice
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	and she wanted to share how proud she was
A	yeah okay yeah
B	my mum used to be so funny she used to look at me
B	no
B	maybe next time
B	oh dear
B	she was so funny cos she was being naughty
A	yeah she was being very naughty
B	you know but
B	because to my mum that would vulgar you know
A	yeah absolutely
B	and
A	it yeah
B	I don't know no-one ever I don't remember anyone explicitly spelling it out to me
A	mm
B	that if someone say say you did do really well at something
A	yeah
B	hypothetically
A	yeah
B	someone said so how did you do?
A	mm
B	you go oh fine thank you I was really relieved
A	mm
B	thank you so much for asking yeah it was er fine
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	you don't go oh yes you know I got twelve As and
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah that's right
B	it's just
A	yeah
B	oh it just makes me
A	it's cringe worthy
B	wince
A	yeah yeah
B	and I know nowadays society encourages everyone to
A	yeah be a little bit more
B	push themselves forward and say
A	yeah
B	how great they are and
A	yeah yeah
B	there's nothing wrong with it necessarily but it's just not
A	and there's a time and a place yeah
B	it's not what I was brought up with and
A	no no mum and gran installed that with me you know it was
B	no no I know but I think
A	it has to be have different
B	I think I was lucky
A	dads and mum
B	cos even though my family was very dysfunctional
A	yeah
B	I never got that
A	no no
B	it's like the worst thing you could do would
A	yeah
B	be to be a show off
A	oh yeah absolutely
B	it wouldn't matter how much of a loser you were
A	absolutely
B	as long as you were friendly
A	yeah
B	as long as you turned up on time as long as you
A	yeah
B	had a laugh and
A	yeah which I now recognise my dad is or well now sort of was
B	yeah
A	sort of could still be I suppose in a way but
B	mm
A	definitely that little bit has been passed on to
B	definitely
A	and
B	it's sad though
A	I've been able to sort of
B	step back
A	sidestep that you know
B	eventually
A	yeah
B	just
A	yeah just
B	yeah
A	sort of like oh no erm but yeah he er
B	no definitely
B	definitely definitely
B	but I remember erm
B	I remember my first interview I went to at my cousin that fucking cat ah there's two of them
A	oh they're having a bit of a party
B	I just don't want to shut all the doors and windows cos I think for four months I'm gonna have to have this place
A	yeah
B	totally sealed
A	well also we're smoking like crazy but
B	no no I don't care
A	yeah
B	about the smoke
B	it's just like so nice not to be freezing cold
A	yeah
B	and have some air
A	yeah exactly it's so mild here
B	but I remember my first ever interview
A	mm
B	and it wasn't that I was trying to be clever but when I look back I find it really funny
A	right
B	cos it's sort of arrogant but then it's sort of not the guy asked me the headmaster asked me
A	yeah
B	what do you think's exceptional about you?
A	okay oh god
B	and I just thought oh for fuck's sake you know
A	oh god what a question
B	and I said well I think the only thing I can think of that is exceptional about me is that I don't think there's anything exceptional about me
B	I said I don't know I said I presume most people think there are lots of exceptional things about them I said I have to be truthful cos I don't wanna get the job under false pretences
A	yeah
B	I don't think there's anything exceptional about me
A	yeah yeah
B	I said I think I'm reliable
A	it's that's a great answer
B	I turn up on time I'm cheerful I meet my deadlines
A	yeah yeah
B	but there is nothing exceptional about me
A	yeah
B	let's be honest
A	yeah
B	and I got the job
A	I would I
B	bloody hell this is such a stupid question what do you think is exceptional about you I thought I'm gonna demean myself for
A	no
B	just for a salary I'm not
A	yeah
B	well
A	yeah
B	you know I think
B	I'm well
A	I've washed my hair for fifty minutes
B	yeah you know I'm I'm
A	every day
B	very academic or you know
B	you know I was in the I don't know
A	I know
B	there's nothing exceptional about anyone
A	I know I know
B	at least I'm not gonna
A	yeah yeah
B	humiliate myself
A	yeah
B	by making up I'm some sort of
B	cos then you know imagine if they did employ me and they're waiting to see all these exceptional
A	yeah
B	characteristics
A	yeah
B	there aren't any cos I'm not you know
A	which is I thought bizarre about that whole interview with
B	I haven't heard anything about him and his
A	and he came up with some cock and bull story which obviously he's very good at doing erm and he just sort of
B	I would just say cos I wasn't clever enough
B	oh of course
A	that's very well done
B	of course cos they're in
A	well
B	they're in cahoots
A	well done
B	they collude with each other
A	you know he said that's very clever very responsive
B	I said to
A	yeah
B	I said do you think the reason that you're so unhappy at work
A	mm
B	you portray yourself as you aren't
A	somebody who you're not
B	really
A	yeah
B	and so
A	and you are just
B	and I was just thinking
A	yeah
B	let's say if I did make out that I was really exceptional and so they take me on on the understanding that I am a really amazing
A	yeah
B	person I'm not
A	yeah
B	I'm ordinary
A	and so you have to live up to this expectation
B	and you're constantly lying and you're constantly
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	it's better just to be truthful about what you are
A	mm
B	because then the sorts of people who take you on are the sorts of people who want someone like you
A	yeah
B	and so
A	exactly
B	cos I've always liked all my jobs right from
A	yeah
B	when I was a cleaner babysitting
A	yeah
B	shop assistant
A	yeah
B	washer upper
A	exactly
B	everything
A	fundamentally
B	I've ever done
A	I've liked my jobs as well
B	has been fine I've never felt
A	no nothing like that
B	and the university I didn't like it I got out
A	yeah
B	and the school I didn't like it so I got out
A	yeah
B	but that wasn't because of me
A	no
B	rubbing anyone up the wrong way
A	no
B	it was just because I wasn't suited to it
A	the conditions yeah yeah
B	but I think if you represent yourself as somebody who you're not
A	yeah
B	then you're never gonna be
A	you're asking for trouble
B	happy at work because they're
A	no
B	waiting for you to be this person
A	yeah
B	that you've said you are
A	er or to trip up
B	but you aren't that person
A	which is what
B	you aren't that person
A	you know
B	you're not exceptional
A	yeah yeah
B	you know you might be good at what you do
A	mm
B	I'm not disputing I'm sure he probably is
A	yeah
B	but you know most people if you've done something for long enough you become quite good at it don't you?
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	yeah I think that comes from
B	but I said it to be nice cos I thought
A	yeah and what did he actually say though?
B	nothing
A	no he wouldn't have known what you were talking about
B	nothing he wasn't nasty he
A	yeah
B	like took he took it I think he
A	yeah
B	took it in
A	yeah nothing to say
B	possibly no no nothing doesn't respond
A	no
B	I was trying to be nice I was thinking that's what I'd want someone to tell me cos I'm sure
A	yeah
B	I'm doing loads of things wrong in my life I want someone to tell me
A	yeah
B	I might not I might not like it but
A	no but
B	eventually I'll start thinking about it
A	well yeah
B	yeah
A	that's how I am and I often ask people
B	I was trying to be nice
A	can you just let me know
B	tell me what I'm doing wrong
A	yeah
B	tell me
A	anything doesn't matter
B	yeah
A	how big or small
B	I don't care
A	I kind of think I can handle it
B	probably won't like it but it's nice
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'm sure it's not going to whole disrupt my whole life you know
B	but can you imagine if you make out that you're really great then
A	yeah
B	everyone's waiting for you to great
A	yeah yeah
B	but you're not great
A	yeah and I think
B	cos
A	this comes from
B	no-one's great
A	my dad
B	yeah
A	having never
B	I know
A	been to university always having wanted to go
B	yeah
A	and then becoming an officer and then I think really fighting for some sense of identity
B	yeah
A	you know
B	and approval
A	yeah
B	and status
A	from his father
B	but you see when your dad's the only time I've really spoken to your dad I haven't really spoken to your dad at all but the only time I've any anything resembling a conversation with your dad when he's been sober
A	yeah
B	has been when we sit together at breakfast
A	yeah
B	now this weird
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I should say past tense
A	yeah
B	well your dad was very nice and he once said oh you know I sometimes
A	mm
B	and I said to him if you'd worked at university as I had
A	mm
B	you'd realise that it's a total load of
A	mm
B	cobblers
B	and I said
A	yeah
B	people who haven't had that education
A	mm
B	like my family
A	mm
B	they assume that
A	oh yeah
B	people who have gone to university
A	yeah
B	like wow I said believe me
A	yeah
B	I said
A	yeah
B	any way of defining intelligence
A	yeah
B	any way
A	isn't isn't
B	you're probably
A	yeah yeah
B	higher than ninety-five percent
A	yeah
B	of the people
A	yeah
B	I've worked with but
A	yeah
B	best in the world or something
A	yeah probably is
B	I said so don't
A	yeah
B	have a thing about it
A	yeah
B	I said I'm sure you know that already but it's all a load of twaddle
A	yeah oh well that would have really have you know
B	well I wasn't trying to
A	yeah but that would have done though
B	yeah but it's true
A	yeah
B	but they
A	no I agree with parts of that you know I really do I really do
B	basically nowadays everyone goes to university you have the opportunity to go to university
A	yeah
B	you go and in
A	yeah
B	the old days
A	yeah
B	you had to be either very clever or very privileged
A	yeah exactly
B	and that's changed now
A	yeah that's so true yeah
B	but I know that
A	yeah
B	I didn't know that at the time when I applied
B	when I applied I thought oh I'm gonna
A	yeah
B	be sitting with people talking about Wittgenstein all day and
B	it's gonna be amazing all we're gonna do is talk about Shakespeare and Schopenhauer and it's gonna be so intellectually
A	yeah
B	after one day
A	yeah
B	I realised that it was just a
A	just a sort of
B	conveyor belt for the middle class
A	that's right yeah
B	you know it's not a bad thing I enjoyed those
A	yeah
B	years but
A	yeah yeah
B	it's nothing to do with intelligence
A	it's one way of doing things
B	nothing
A	yeah
B	I mean literally nothing
A	no
B	zero
A	no
B	but
A	mm mm
B	and he goes no he did it as an adult
A	mm
B	he goes I swear I swear on my life
A	yeah
B	I thought this is just really embarrassing this is
A	I mean so
B	it's not true
A	so so parts of that that that isn't true
B	no
A	but I can see where the lie sprang from is you know dad went to erm a erm
B	yeah
A	where you go and do some quite interesting shit
B	oh yeah I don't doubt it
A	which
B	I said
A	may have been on of a level
B	yeah but that's not the same as having
A	somewhat but it's er
B	but I said to
A	it might be more sort of
B	I said I'm not
A	post-grad but
B	I'm not saying he couldn't have
A	yeah I don't think he was
B	done one but
A	doing original research
B	because he but
A	no
B	the only reason I was sure of this
A	yeah
B	is because he had sat down and said oh
A	yeah
B	about I never
A	and he actually knows what he's talking about
B	oh
A	he knows the difference between a PhD and you know sort of a professional course
B	and I don't think your dad doesn't lie
A	no
B	I don't think er he doesn't make up things
A	no he doesn't no
B	no I've never
A	no well I mean he can bend the truth somewhat
B	yeah yeah but the same as everyone
A	but that's not the same
B	I don't I don't think
A	I just call it call it the Irish you know
B	yeah but I think that's something
A	oh he's does fabricate
B	yeah
A	god knows what he fabricates about me and that and actually sometimes I do meet people who erm I have never met before and
B	mm
A	I fall short you know quite a lot of the time and I I'm
B	it's made up
B	yeah
A	you know
B	cos when I sort of
A	but then when they get to know me better
B	yeah
A	they say actually oh you were the elder sister
B	yeah it's funny isn't it?
A	because they really know now they've caught it out like or caught him out
B	yeah
A	that actually he's still in kid mode where he's lying
B	yeah
A	oh I I got five pounds for my pocket money
B	yeah but
A	but you didn't
B	no
A	you know something like that
B	you didn't get any
B	but if someone it's difficult
A	you know
B	because I don't think
A	I won a bronze
B	there's no point
A	no no gold medal
B	there's no point
A	no you won a gold medal
B	having a conversation
A	yeah
B	for no reason
A	no
B	but at the same time you sort of feel that maybe you're colluding if you just kind of go oh you know
A	well the thing is is that he doesn't do it with me
B	no okay
A	at all you know and I've
B	okay
A	actually got him into the you know well a relationship I would say where I don't
B	no it's difficult though isn't it cos if
A	just don't stand for it but
B	cos
A	if you're an outsider as in
B	cos I thought it was all true
A	you're getting to know him yeah absolutely
B	I would genuinely thought it was all true cos I thought
A	yeah
B	why would someone
A	lie yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah but you know there's
B	to me
A	so many times where I've caught
B	but I could understand
A	you know
B	why you might lie to someone who
A	mm
B	and you know I
A	mm
B	it doesn't make it right but it makes sense
A	mm
B	but I mean surely me I mean who would even
A	yeah
B	care what I thought you know
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	yeah no I I don't know and he does do it with lots and lots of people but it's really interesting how I'll tell you a story about this that talking about lying and it takes one to know one but when
B	he's just so
A	I know
B	he's so different
A	he is so good like
B	I mean he's really the other extreme
A	yeah
B	isn't he?
B	it's like I mean I don't
A	extremely
B	I don't know him but that's just the impression I get
B	he's just so
A	yeah yeah yeah he doesn't stand for any of this you know
B	no
A	he really doesn't get it at all
B	no
A	but erm so
B	shall we shall we have another little bit?
A	yeah
B	I mean
A	no not eat yeah
B	go and get any food we'll go and get some food at some point
A	no you're right absolutely right yes
A	my god
B	I'm not I'm not very good with food
B	have to remind myself
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	and now this was all a little bit of an odd situation because my mum and my dad and
B	yeah
A	so it was the area
B	yes
A	so the the the the erm the place where we were gonna get married where where we got married and
B	no
A	as long as things go well
B	yeah
A	erm
B	as long as everyone's happy
A	he he he can tell me what he bloody well wants
B	what do you need to do?
A	you know
B	show up in a frock and smile
A	yeah
B	and go home
A	exactly
B	you know
A	and he's just got to do his bit
B	yeah
A	but that's fine
B	yeah
A	okay so I thought
B	no no point worrying
A	yeah
B	that's what I always think as well
A	and no no point sort of really worrying about
B	engaging
A	any of this
B	particularly
A	exactly
B	yeah
A	so when he walked in I noticed that there was a sense of erm animosity
B	okay
A	village pub
B	that's interesting
A	and er the landlady
B	are you the client?
A	but I'm going to have a drink but we hadn't invited him and we hadn't organised to meet him at all
B	oh god
A	I think in passing
B	it's this ego thing
A	we said we might go to this pub anyway
B	okay
A	he's come up to
B	seems fine everything yeah
B	yeah
A	gets a taxi to this place
B	mm
A	where we all meet together
B	mm
A	we all have a drink and then
B	mm
A	we'll go home and have something to eat
B	mm
A	and he got talking to this guy and slowly but surely it was becoming quite argumentative
B	okay
A	and
B	so were you like tuned in to the conversation or were you just getting an impression of the vibe?
A	it there well erm I was talking to my mum and I was desperately trying to ignore it erm because I thought
B	yeah but
A	I mean
B	at the side lines of your consciousness
A	yes
B	you can tell that there's something
A	yeah
B	rumbling
A	yeah and I noticed that my dad gone become really silent
B	okay which is unusual
A	yeah
B	I don't mean that rudely
A	well well no
B	but I mean it's unusual
A	but I mean normally he'd be chatting
B	yeah
A	erm but he'd become silent so I thought
B	cos I'm quite
A	yeah
B	like socially
A	but normally
B	unless
A	he would just be sort of engaging in that
B	yeah no he is quite chatty isn't he?
A	yeah
B	he's quite
A	you know I'm the father of the bride to be
B	yeah yeah yeah of course
A	I'll talk shit for a little while
B	and it's all exciting and
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but he'd really
B	and everyone's having a drink
A	kind of gone silent exactly
B	so everyone becomes
A	yeah
B	a bit more ebullient
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and it was just gonna be the one
B	yeah
A	and you know okay I could see that
B	yeah yeah
A	you could smell it on his breath
B	yeah
A	but he wasn't
B	no no no
A	at all
B	he's still still socially acceptable
A	you know yeah
B	yeah
A	anyway
B	yeah
A	erm
B	no
A	so I and then I started to ignore it and then I looked at my dad and he said I think it's really time to go
B	your dad said?
A	we all got up to leave and
B	okay but you and your dad were obviously attuned to the fact that the vibe for want of a better word wasn't ideal
A	wasn't going too well yeah
B	but
B	cos you can tell you can tell I can
A	mm
B	I can never articulate it
A	mm
B	but you can just tell when
A	oh god
B	you were thank you so much
A	I I couldn't decide at that point which either or the the two options that you've said
B	mm
A	but so we stayed
B	yeah
A	and then
B	okay
A	and erm
B	so this guy generally hadn't created a very positive impression of himself? he hadn't really
A	when he wasn't in the pub er in his own terms you know he was selling his place like
B	yeah
A	you know you're the clients I'm going to sell you everything
B	the spiel
A	absolutely which well one
B	yeah
A	would expect
B	exactly
A	that's quite normal how are you
B	totally totally totally
A	how are you going to decide otherwise? someone's selling you something
B	totally right totally
A	something as important as your wedding day
B	yeah
A	so there you go
B	it's the way it goes
B	you play the game go through the motions
A	we'd already signed on the
B	yeah
A	on the contract
B	anyway
A	it's all yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	but your dad's obviously feeling uncomfortable and wants to leave
A	very much so
B	and
A	mm
B	so there's been a divergence
A	yes
B	of desires here
A	yeah exactly yeah
B	yeah
A	and this guy's sitting right in the middle of it
B	right
A	and he accepts this drink
B	and the only other people there are you and
A	and my mum
B	and your mum of course
A	yeah
B	god yeah of course
A	who nipped out for a cigarette
B	oh poor your mum
A	and I nipped out for a cigarette and I said to her
B	I feel as if I know your mum
A	I know
B	it's so funny
A	I know it's it's incredible
B	all I know about your mum is that she liked golf she liked Lovejoy
B	she liked telly she didn't like going out much
A	she liked tennis as well
B	and
A	mm
B	stylish you know
A	yeah
B	like somehow
A	yeah
B	a cut above
A	she's sort of yeah
B	a cut above
A	I think she did she did she had to
B	sort of got embarrassed and
A	rise above it
B	yeah
A	quite a lot of the time
B	I feel as if I know her cos I've seen those photos and
A	yeah
B	I dunno she's
A	yeah
B	real to me
A	yeah
B	the
A	mm
B	probably doesn't bear that relation to the real
A	no no but it really is so what you said is true
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah well exactly
A	anyway
A	and then we are right into the middle of it the thick of it and
B	why though?
A	or utterance and then he but really so how's that then? how would you have gone to
B	ah so the guy was making it up?
A	well we didn't know what was going on at that stage but I used to work for blah-blah-blah or blah
B	but why would you get I mean
A	right
B	but people make things up
A	yeah
B	I don't actually care
A	mm
B	it's just nice when you realise
A	yeah
B	because then you realise but
A	but
B	it doesn't make me
A	but
B	necessarily think worse of the person I wouldn't just because someone makes up everything in their life I wouldn't necessarily think that means they're a bad person or they're
A	yeah
B	I'd just assume they've got some sort of I don't know what you call it
A	yeah
B	like personality
A	some something's clearly wrong but I'm looking at
B	but I wouldn't get agitated about it is what I mean
A	yeah that's absolutely right he
B	like I'd never go how dare you lie it's like come on
A	well and it was getting quite you know
B	you just assume that they've got reasons
A	yeah
B	that you don't understand
A	yeah
B	and it's a bit weird and it's
A	mm
B	a bit disconcerting but it's not
A	mm
B	it's not as if they've been nasty to you
A	but it shouldn't really have affected
B	no
A	as much as it did
B	no no no
A	but it went on and er so much to the point where erm there was cross swords
B	so your dad had picked up on it your mum
A	yeah
B	had picked up on it
A	yeah
B	you sort of picked up on it
B	poor
A	what the fuck is your brother doing?
B	oh poor
A	said what is he doing?
B	oh I know I don't know
A	yeah it
B	I just feel like a
A	it was just like where is this guy coming from? we're about to get married
B	to me I know this is awful
A	this is the place we're gonna get married this is the guy who owns it
B	you know you know when you don't know someone properly
A	yeah
B	you sort of put them in a box because you don't know them but
A	yeah
B	to me
A	he is
B	he's just gentle
A	he is
B	and he's just
A	and I that's what I love about him
B	and of course there's much more to him
A	yeah yeah
B	but I don't know him so
A	yeah but he is
B	he's just and
A	I mean really is
B	and you put him somewhere
A	like that
B	like I remember
A	yeah
B	that time when he was at
A	yeah
B	and he was just nice
A	yeah
B	and if someone calls on him to say something he'll chatter on
A	yeah
B	and then when people don't want him to talk anymore he'll
B	close his mouth and
A	yeah
B	it just
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a doesn't agree with anything that has been said	Contradiction
A	yeah he's an affable person
B	cos I think I'm a bit like that
A	yeah
B	I try to give people what they want and it's not
A	yeah
B	because I wanna be liked it's not cos I'm passive but it's just
A	it's just
B	sometimes in a stressful situation no-one else really feels like talking
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has a girlfriend	Neutral
B	so then I'll take on the role where I talk
A	yeah
B	or if everybody else wants to hold fort I'm happy just to sit there
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b just wants to be liked	Entailment
B	I don't care
A	mm
B	I don't it's just to try and
A	no you're not trying to
B	make things nice to everyone and
B	make sure everyone's happy
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah yeah and everyone getting on
B	just be appreciative
A	yes that's nice
B	smile
A	yeah that's it yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b strives for other people's happiness	Entailment
B	you know I don't have many
A	yeah
B	social skills but just
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is a very social person	Contradiction
B	smile and say
A	yeah
B	thank you and
A	that that's it
B	yeah that's basically ninety-nine percent of it
B	you know just kind of
B	try and exude good will
A	yeah exactly that's
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b never says thank you	Contradiction
A	what I try
B	people don't like they don't
A	yeah
B	like it
A	yeah tough luck
B	yeah my conscience
A	so
B	is clear
B	I try my best
B	what do they want blood?
A	they want something but they're not gonna get it
B	you know be on time
A	yeah
B	say thank you if they've given anything
A	yeah exactly
B	listen
A	yeah
B	respond and just smile and
A	yeah
B	then go away again
A	that's it that's it
B	yeah
A	yeah no trouble
B	no
A	so it went on like this and erm so as I said it all got to cross swords and I said well I think we should all leave
B	so you were the one who
A	yeah
B	well done
A	mm
B	cos after all
A	whatever his name was
B	it's your bloody wedding
A	that's right and I said we'll be in touch we'll see you later everyone bailed like this
B	yeah
A	and we all bailed you know
B	like a fire alarm
A	yeah
A	yeah that's exactly it
B	like do you remember do you remember in Silkwood?
A	and so all the way back on the journey it was probably about a thirty minute journey back to
B	so he didn't like it when someone else did it?
A	mm
B	that's really interesting
A	and then later with the bottles of red wine
B	cos I would have thought if you did it yourself you would be quite erm
A	yeah
B	you'd just think oh well no harm's meant
A	yeah
B	cos I don't think
A	yeah
B	any harm
A	no
B	oh god this is just awful when you see that new one being opened and you think
A	yeah
B	oh please
A	mum mum was just like you know
B	when you see the more whisky being
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	oh I know
B	it just gets this is only gonna get worse
A	yeah
B	it's like bad enough already
A	yeah
B	it's only gonna get worse
A	oh yeah very messy
B	cos I've said to
A	yeah
B	and I enjoy it
A	yeah
B	genuinely
A	yeah
B	but not just with any old person cos I
A	oh god no
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think there might be an old person which Person B whish there were not	Neutral
B	I'm very picky about who I'll
A	yeah
B	have a drink with
A	yeah
B	I'll have
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	like two beers
A	yeah
B	yeah of course
A	yeah yeah
B	but
A	but not
B	no
A	no not that
B	I need to feel very safe and I need to feel
[ANNOTATION]	Person B feels that he needs to be sure that the situation that he is in it is safe	Entailment
A	feel safe exactly
B	that I know them
A	can get out if I you need to
B	and I need to trust them and you need to know
A	yeah
B	from prior experience
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think Person B is right about the safety and trust ,which are important at your work	Neutral
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think Person B is right about the safety and trust ,which are important in your work	Neutral
B	what they're gonna be like
A	yeah I think you're right
B	otherwise I feel very
A	yeah
B	comfortable cos you know it's only gonna get worse
A	mm mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think it is weird that the situation is gonna be worse	Neutral
B	yeah
A	or embarrassed
B	and when you see that new bottle opening
A	yeah
B	and you just think oh god
A	and that's
B	yeah it's just
A	yeah
B	it's only gonna get worse
A	yeah
B	and that's like weddings
A	yeah
B	the meal's okay
A	yeah
B	it's gonna get worse and worse
A	yeah
B	and worse
A	yeah yeah
B	someone's gonna cry
A	yeah
B	someone's gonna be sick someone's gonna be
A	yeah
B	aggressive
A	someone's going to be yeah
B	someone's gonna yeah it just
A	yeah it all comes out yeah
B	yeah
A	all sort of a spectrum of emotions
B	yeah I don't like it
A	and and behaviour
B	I I don't know why
A	yeah yeah
B	I'm sure there's probably some psychoanalytic reason
A	yeah
B	but I just
A	oh well cos with a whole bunch of people
B	if I know people like
A	yeah
B	I don't know now cos she's
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	but
A	but she's fine
B	she's so
A	yeah yeah
B	and and it she used to sometimes tell me well
A	yeah
B	I can't explain
A	yeah
B	it's like
A	yeah it didn't doesn't yeah that as her being a friend yeah
B	and my friend
A	yeah
B	I feel totally safe with him
A	yeah
B	my friend
A	yeah
B	my friend
A	yeah
B	probably about five or six people
A	yeah but you're alright with
B	oh happily
A	yeah yeah
B	I'll get pissed myself
A	yeah
B	or I won't
A	yeah
B	get you know
A	yeah
B	I'll just feel comfortable but not just when you
A	no
B	don't really know because you just
A	where it where it's gonna go
B	never really know and
A	yeah
B	I'm always a bit cautious
A	yeah
B	and you just feel very wary
A	I think that's very very wise
B	yeah
A	very very wise so it went on like this and I said well the outcome of it is er I'm now embarrassed and he said well you shouldn't be embarrassed and I said well I am embarrassed because this is now an embarrassing situation
B	it's your bloody wedding as well
A	and then when it came to the wedding day this guy proved to be a bit of a dickhead okay?
B	yeah
A	but
B	but then again most people are so
A	yeah and and you know
B	it's not the end of the world
A	I wasn't going to let that distract my day
B	no and you're marrying
A	or our day yeah
B	and that's
A	and god knows we're gonna forget it anyway
B	yeah
A	so and which I have
B	and it's just to go through the motions isn't it?
A	yeah
B	really
A	and of course
B	not in a funny way
A	and of course
B	but it's like you and
A	and of course yeah we're fine
B	having your lives together
A	yeah exactly
B	he's obsessed with how awful
A	yeah and both of them are
B	but
A	yeah
B	mental so you have to
A	yeah and actually
B	he is a bit of a mutant but he's not a bad person
A	and er you know as far as I was concerned
B	and he is mad he is
A	you know
B	actually mad mad and
A	well he yeah he genuinely
B	you know like nowadays
A	is mad
B	everyone's
A	yeah
B	depressed everyone's this and everyone's that
A	yeah but he really is
B	but there are people like
A	yeah
B	and the people like my dad they're
A	yeah
B	actually mad
A	yeah
B	and the problem is is that everyone being mad nowadays
A	yeah
B	it detracts from the fact that there are people who are actually
A	yeah
B	mad in the old fashioned way
A	yeah exactly yeah
B	yeah
A	like you would have been locked up into a madhouse
B	yeah
A	like you know
B	yeah so you have
B	people like Stephen Fry
A	yeah
B	oh one in three people have got mental health problems
A	yeah
B	yeah I don't doubt it but
A	mm
B	there is a spectrum
A	mm
B	and there are people like
A	yes yeah
B	and people who think well everyone's mad if I say oh my dad was mad they go oh yes that's like me I suffer from depression
A	yeah
B	no no no that's not what I mean
A	no no you're not know what I'm talking about
B	no
A	yeah
B	no it's it's it's slightly different
A	it's so
B	but he's not bad
A	you know
B	he's not
A	but that's how he remembers the wedding
B	but it's like fixating on the negative
A	something positive?
B	yeah
A	you know the bit where we had fun
B	and it's only one guy everyone knows he's a plonker everyone knows he's a bit weird everyone knows he's like a drug casualty
A	yeah
B	he's not cruel he's not
A	no
B	evil he's he's
A	oh god he's far from it you know I
B	I think he's a nice guy he's a plonker
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	he's like a spoilt lump
A	yeah
B	and a baby
A	yeah
B	but
A	but but yeah harmless
B	I don't think he's got a bad bone in his body
A	you know
B	yeah
A	in that respect apart from the fact that he's mad but which doesn't
B	yeah
A	make him harmless but that's not actually
B	but I'm not a PC person
A	his intention to harm people
B	but I do think you have to step back a bit when the person
A	yeah
B	is clearly loopy I mean
A	yeah
B	he's brought it on himself with the drugs
A	yeah
B	in my opinion but
A	yeah yeah yeah but that was just my point was that
B	yeah
B	and what's the point in
A	I was making
B	dwelling on it?
A	was that he really wanted to catch a liar out
B	yeah
A	and actually show everyone
B	it's really interesting
A	that he was clever enough to actually work that that bit out
B	mm
A	show my dad I suppose because it really he really hadn't thought about how that would impact on on the
B	cos the average person wouldn't care
A	well the the situation wasn't
B	like say if you if you said to me that this is
A	called for
B	completely hypothetical
A	yeah
B	let's just say oh
A	yeah
B	last week because I won a competition I'd be thinking to myself I don't think that's really true but I'd go oh it doesn't matter I don't care
A	yeah
B	you know I'd be like oh okay and try and change the subject
A	yeah
B	you know just hypothetically
A	yeah oh that's lovely but yeah so what about the weather?
B	no but I wouldn't I wouldn't feel any need to
B	like
A	to exert some sort of
B	oh
A	pressure or
B	assault on my
A	yeah
B	identity or
A	yeah
B	mm it doesn't really matter does it?
A	and actually the thing that happened on that day I wouldn't be surprised if somehow they've really pissed well
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	where dad and
B	yeah
A	with him
B	yeah
A	now I was completely oblivious to this because of course I was with my guests and I was having a
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	great time but then this all became a massive story
B	and it becomes a big thing
A	and it was a big thing
B	it becomes a thing
A	that was a big negative thing in my view
B	yeah
A	whereas there were so many great positive aspects of it
B	so probably the only two really negative things in any way connected to your wedding was the fact that
A	and actually neither of those things affected me or
B	A either of them matter
A	yeah exactly
B	and B there were probably fifty thousand nice things
A	yeah
B	that you could have remembered
A	absolutely
B	really not
A	share me
B	doesn't want either of you to have a life
A	with
B	no exactly
A	and yes you're right
B	no
A	going to have
B	I don't think your dad wants you or
A	yeah yeah
B	and
A	mm
B	and I don't think
A	mm
B	I don't think anyone wants you to have your own life
A	no
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah but don't do it
A	and and no god no and and er and that's the thing
B	it gets warring though I know it's tiring
A	it it no it's very warring and it's almost like
B	don't do it
A	and
B	cos you escaped
A	wouldn't it be nice if somehow
B	yes and it's just the three of you
A	locked in
B	yeah
A	mm no well I've
B	yeah
A	worked that one out
B	that's why
A	since
B	keep keep a good hold on
A	yeah yeah oh god don't worry
B	because I know
B	because nobody is ideal
A	no no of course not
B	because you're only human but
A	yeah but he's a genuine person
B	a separate entity
A	yeah yeah he's somebody I believe in a lot a great deal yeah
B	well he's a nice guy
A	yeah and he really believes in me so
B	yeah what what more do you want?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	a great deal you know erm
B	I just think in life you have to have
A	yeah
B	realistic
A	yeah
B	hopes
A	expectations
B	yeah
A	yeah I go I agree with that I think you do and I know marriage
B	yeah yeah yeah exactly
A	so she kind of said forewarned me and said well you know what?
B	it's just I I think
A	plus if you're married to my father
B	thank you so much I think basically it's like
A	you know
B	it's like it sounds so silly but I think it's manners
A	mm
B	and to feel someone's on your side
A	yes yeah
B	and everything else
A	yeah
B	whatever
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah I agree
B	it's like
A	I agree I completely agree with that
B	thank you so much
A	mm but
B	it is a funny old thing
A	it's a funny old thing
B	but it's interesting about that lying thing
A	it is really interesting about that lying thing
B	cos
A	I don't know why
B	when I say I've never known
A	yeah
B	it maybe that I have known but I haven't really been aware of it so I'll rephrase it as as far as I'm aware
A	yeah
B	I've never before met
A	somebody quite like yeah
B	a fabricator
A	yeah
B	I've met someone who tells lies to get out of trouble
A	mm
B	oh I was working late
A	mm
B	when actually they're seeing someone else
A	yeah
B	or
A	yeah
B	you know and those type of lies
A	yeah yeah
B	and to get someone
A	yeah
B	off your back
A	yeah
B	oh god yeah and probably
A	yeah
B	as much as the next person I've never met someone who as far as I know
A	yeah
B	I've never met somebody who just
A	quite delusional
B	yeah and then
A	yeah
B	become really quite agitated and I swear I swear on someone's
A	yeah
B	life you know ask
A	mm mm
B	ask but about really strange things
A	mm
B	when
A	mm it's really of no consequence yeah
B	yeah really weird
A	yeah
B	and it took me ages before I realised
A	yeah
B	it's none of it's true
A	yeah yeah it it still concerns me a great deal but I suppose
B	I suppose it's harmless
A	there's really nothing
B	but it's a it's a problem isn't it?
A	like there's nothing
B	nothing anyone can do but does your dad know?
A	got nothing more to say
B	does
A	I'm sure he's aware of it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	cos I thought
A	what did you think?
B	you know I said I was like or I thought oh poor
A	yeah
B	and he's seeing it's such a come down you know
A	mm
B	cos you were such an amazing person and everything
A	mm
B	and I thought it must be hard like if you're fighting in Afghanistan
B	to come back and work for a media agency
A	I know
B	I did think it was true cos I thought
B	cos I thought
A	yeah
B	but then I and then
A	yeah
B	like gradually as the time goes by I thought
A	yeah
B	I don't think that's actually true
A	oh and so you so when
B	no I didn't really know I didn't really know
A	okay
B	because
A	I just knew you had a brother you know
B	yeah she's a really good one for that you know that she you know a good one in the sense that erm
B	but
A	she's very sensible
B	she's so she's so erm
A	yeah but she's got a good grip on
B	yes she has yeah cos she's got a good
A	a good grip of who he is
B	grip on everything she's so sensible like
A	yeah
B	all the advice
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I've never taken any of it it's always been good advice
A	mm
B	and it's always like I think with my own best interest at heart
A	yeah
B	and it's very rational and it's very I'm just not really like that
A	yeah yeah
B	I'd love to be like that
B	but I'm not I just
A	yeah no I'm not at all yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	advice about like what to do about like selling the flat and
A	yeah yeah
B	like about the
A	yeah
B	the will and like she's like
A	yeah
B	and it's all really good advice but I just can't do it cos it's not me
A	yeah that's it that's it
B	you know
A	and that's absolutely fine as well
B	yeah
A	you know
B	and like most things
A	yeah
B	and it's just like people
A	yeah
B	are what they are you can't
A	that's like exactly right you can't change
B	you can't be someone else
A	no
B	if I could have choreographed my life from when I was an embryo
B	then I would have probably choreographed it to be a bit more like
B	it doesn't work like that you know
A	this lone little foetus that
B	mm
A	doing choreography
B	do you know what mean yeah
A	and we'll sit down there later
B	but I'm not I'm not sensible
A	you move my head that way
B	but honestly well you should set aside like half an hour a day to like tidy up and everything and I say yeah I really should
B	I really should but
A	yeah
B	have I done that?
A	but I won't
B	or be
B	she says okay
B	from when I moved and I moved like four years ago
B	I said god knows what's in there
A	but but they're useful
B	can't be bothered
A	they have a practical use
B	and they're out of the way
A	they've they've got something in them yeah
B	you know
A	mm
B	you know they're not blocking my path
A	no
B	to the kettle or the shower that sort of thing
A	yeah so why not?
B	yeah but it's not as if I think I'm right I think I'm wrong but
A	no but
B	but I don't think it really matters
A	it
B	yeah
A	yeah I completely agree so it's really interesting now that I think that I'm in a juncture with erm you know er
B	and I think probably being with
A	yes
B	be yourself more
A	yeah yeah yeah and there are other things
B	because
A	and there are other
B	not the kind of person who's only gonna like you if A and he's
A	yes
B	gonna like you less if B
A	B yeah yeah
B	and in a way I can imagine that could be quite annoying in some ways
A	mm
B	but actually overall it's very very positive
A	yeah
B	because it gives you the space to actually finally
A	yeah
B	be able to inhabit your own personality
A	yes yeah
B	which you were never given the opportunity to do before
A	true very true
B	and that's a huge thing that you can't put a price on
A	no god yeah yeah
B	and the downside of it is maybe that the person is a little bit passive at times or could be seen to be a little bit passive at times
A	yeah yeah
B	but the upside is precisely what I've just said you're given that space
A	incredible amount of space
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and if you were awarded a Nobel Prize or if you were living
B	homeless in a doorway I don't think
A	even it wouldn't matter to him
A	no
B	in the slightest
A	no
B	as mine wouldn't
A	no I think just
B	and it's very liberating
A	it's just about you know our fulfilment whatever that means
B	yeah
A	to the individual
B	whatever
A	yeah which is why I think well I was going to say
B	and who cares what other people think? I dunno I've got a kind of arrogance I don't care
A	yeah
B	what people think of me I really don't care
A	but now we really don't now
B	no
A	when I realise when I look at
B	yeah
A	and I see things a little bit more erm
B	objectively maybe or with a bit more perspective
A	yeah yeah
B	step back
A	yeah a
B	oh definitely
A	mm
B	definitely
A	mm
B	because they're not happy
A	mm
B	they're not happy
A	mm
B	cos how can you be happy when you don't relate to anyone?
A	the only reason why I say that is because I know that
B	I totally agree
A	we love each other but that's a sort of
B	yeah of course
A	another thing that's
B	of course
B	yeah
A	but
B	yeah
A	in terms of respect and sort of erm an easy going manner and an appreciation of each other for for for who they are or for who we are
B	no
A	and it's quite likely that it won't
B	no I agree
A	I think we're now at a juncture
B	I agree
A	where it's like okay
B	cos it's not as if you and
A	no
B	and your dad's forty
A	and yeah
B	no it's not gonna happen really let's be realistic
A	and er and that's what
B	it might
B	but I don't think it is
A	she said to me when you broke away from your brother trying to emulate your brother at about
B	yeah
A	eight or nineteen I saw a massive change in your
B	yeah
A	and I actually thought great
B	mm
A	I'm beginning to actually find out
B	mm mm
A	who
B	but
A	yeah
B	isn't she?
A	very
B	even I was really surprised
A	yeah
B	I don't know if you remember but you know when we were round at her house I can't remember when it was
A	yeah
B	a couple of months ago and she was saying
A	yeah
B	it was almost she was that's it was the first time I realised that she knew that
A	yeah yeah
B	cos I just never talk about it cos that was like a bad time
A	yeah I know
B	for
A	yeah
B	if she brings it up I'd be like oh yes okay
A	yeah
B	but she
A	she really cottoned onto that
B	she's sussed isn't she?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah and I think that's now where I'm at which is
B	friendship
A	it yeah
B	friendship
A	it really is
B	cos friendship's got no ulterior motives
A	no
B	they don't want your money they don't want to canoodle
A	no
B	with you they don't want
A	no
B	your approval they don't want
A	yeah
B	they just like you
A	yeah
B	for whatever reason
A	exactly whatever it is
B	yeah
A	yeah and I suppose
B	yeah of course
A	and that is okay
B	that's the way to go
A	I think that's okay
B	so do I
A	you know
B	I do as well
A	I mean that's absolutely fine and that's why I didn't mind talking to
B	no
A	the
B	no
A	exploring something
B	yeah
A	other than that
B	it's an option
A	because it did give me a sense of I'm just one person
B	yes
A	in
B	in a dynamic in a huge dynamic
A	in this whole
B	that goes back
A	line of ancestry
B	generations before yeah
A	really not
B	it's perspective
A	important this isn't going
B	and I don't know if it's
A	to be important
B	I don't know if it
A	you now
B	I don't think it's changing the subject but I think also I just tend to think as long as I do those basic things if people don't like it then
A	yeah stuff them
B	it's that
A	yeah
B	yeah but I and another thing there's nothing I can do there's no point
A	no there's
B	losing any sleep over it is there?
A	yeah
B	it's like you try you try and
A	yeah
B	you try and bring out the best in people
A	yes
B	you try and be kind to people
A	yeah
B	my mum always told me be more tolerant I'm not
A	yeah
B	naturally tolerant but I've
B	trained myself to be
A	to be
B	as ostensibly tolerant
A	yeah yeah which as a teacher is a good thing yeah
B	yeah
A	it's a necessary thing
B	just try to
A	yeah
B	give people the space
A	mm
B	to be themselves and if they're not satisfied
A	yeah
B	then kind of fuck them really
A	yeah
B	but not in a nasty way not in a confrontational
A	no
B	way
A	oh god no not
B	or anything just
A	to pull them up on it no
B	because life's so short there's no point
A	yeah yeah oh there really isn't yeah and that's
B	getting involved in all this anguish
A	and that's what I've decided
B	yeah
A	is that's how I'm at now
B	and I just always feel
A	you know
B	if you had a million
A	wherever
B	people like applauding me oh
A	mm
B	if you had a million people go
A	mm
B	I don't actually care I don't care about either
A	no
B	cos I'm not interested
A	yeah
B	I'm not
A	yeah it doesn't bother you
B	no
A	yeah
B	what their criteria are is a
A	yeah
B	mystery to me and
A	yeah yeah
B	you can't really live like that
A	no
B	you just
A	yeah
B	try to be kind
A	yeah
B	try to be cheerful
A	exactly
B	try not to be a drain on people
A	yes yeah
B	try to
A	just
B	be tolerant
A	yeah yeah
B	I'm not actually tolerant try to be
A	yeah
B	tolerant and just
A	yeah
B	smile and
A	yeah
B	not take things to heart and then
A	that's it
B	if people don't like it they don't like it there's nothing you can do really
A	yeah that's exactly right yeah
B	but people agonise over everything
A	oh I know oh god this email here that email oh did I say this? I dunno did I
B	yeah
A	it's like oh god
B	yeah
A	just so exhausting
B	it is it is really
A	and I've
B	exhausting it's such a drain
A	forget about yeah
B	it's a drain
A	yeah and it's an absolute mindset that people you know find themselves in and I guess that's what happens you know is that the you get locked into something and you just don't realise
B	mm
A	that you've got a choice that you just unlock yourself from that
B	yeah
A	you know just don't
B	just step back
A	yeah
B	extricate yourself
A	yes exactly
B	you know save yourself
A	yes
B	save yourself
A	save yourself
B	that's so true
B	that's so true
A	while you still can
B	I'm just gonna say one thing cos I was gonna do
A	yeah
B	a digression before
A	yeah
B	about when you were saying that your mum and gran had maybe chose to withhold certain information
A	yeah yeah
B	I think I might have mentioned it before but I think I told you that I've got these relatives they're my mum's cousins
A	right
B	and they're doing the family tree thing you know
A	mm
B	you know every family's got one
A	mm
B	the genealogy
A	mm
B	or whatever I don't know how to pronounce it
A	mm
B	and all these things that my granny never told me
A	yeah
B	and I kind of feel bad cos I feel I do know these things now
A	yeah yeah
B	but she chose not to tell me just like
A	right
B	for example
A	right
B	the story I was always brought up with was that she had a husband who died when they were very very young of tuberculosis
A	right
B	turns out he never died
B	they went their separate ways but because it was taboo
A	yeah
B	to separate
A	yeah
B	so she just presented herself in a new part of the world
A	right
B	so
A	wonderful
B	my mum's parents weren't actually married because she was already married
B	I mean just for example
A	yeah
B	and so her son grew up thinking oh you know he doesn't have a father but he did have a father
B	this is a silly thing
A	it's just I know
B	but just
A	yeah
B	she didn't tell me because why should she tell me?
A	yeah
B	like you know who knows what happened I don't know
A	yeah
B	it's like oh he died of TB
A	yeah it's completely plausible
B	it's er
A	yeah
B	very funny she was a fallen woman
A	Flora Tristan you know
B	my mum was er
A	I love this
B	illegitimate
A	I loved oh actually that was one of yours I was just thinking about thinking about that book that I just read was it Flora Tristan?
B	mm
A	and I really love the sort of you know struggle that she had
B	I love that book
A	about oh I have to really lie about this
A	yeah
B	maybe trying to be nice maybe he thinks oh I'm a woman so it's by a woman and I like books and it's a book
A	yeah and normally he would like to talk to you about
B	yeah
A	certain yeah
B	I really enjoyed the book
A	yeah
B	I did talk about it
A	yeah but I love the struggle she had about
B	she's amazing
A	I had to really lie and go hammer and tong about
B	yeah
A	you know getting married to this other guy and
B	yeah
A	you know god yeah wonderful
B	yeah
A	wonderful this could all be great
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah I loved it
B	I couldn't believe it I thought it was really good
A	I did say I had to rewind rewind rewind
B	but you know when someone gives you a book and lends you a book and you think mm
A	yeah
B	you know and it's like Virago or something and women's writing
A	yeah
B	and I think oh mm yeah
A	oh god no
B	this is brilliant
A	it's I lovely they're er
B	it was really good
A	there were there are parts of that where I just well yeah I can identify with that
B	but if
A	yeah
B	I saw that in a second hand bookshop I'd never pick it up and buy it
A	no neither would I neither would I
B	and I read it out of politeness
A	yeah yeah
B	I started reading it out of politeness
B	and then I just thought it was amazing
B	yeah
A	and that made me think of then as well as
B	mm
A	half-sister my mum's half-sister erm I suppose my half-aunt
B	it's like your step auntie
A	yeah
B	oh no half-auntie
A	my half-aunt I suppose
B	half-auntie
A	that's what she said erm was her mum explained to her the reason why her dad didn't live with them was because there wasn't erm any room in the house
B	you know you know
B	my dad's other kid children
A	mm
B	the one in Canada sister and the one in Spain
A	right
B	was my sister I thought she was just like my mum's friend or something
A	okay
B	she was just some woman
A	yeah and she's
B	you know when you're a child
A	yeah
B	and these people turn up and you say
A	yes how have you yeah
B	oh hello you know
A	are you well
B	our generation you just sit quietly and do your drawing or something
B	it's not this thing where the kids are told everything
A	yeah that's right
B	but I never no-one ever really told me
A	yeah
B	and it's like oh
A	so when did you find out?
B	when I was about twelve
A	right and that
B	certainly nine ten
A	yeah
B	maybe
A	was that because you asked or just something sort of
B	dunno
A	said or you can't
B	I just remember being like oh I can remember the feeling of like oh
A	yeah
B	cos I thought you know when you're a kid and your mum will have
A	yeah
B	various ladies
A	yeah for tea or
B	and you don't really know who they are
A	for drinks or whatever
B	you know they'll be like a neighbour or someone she's met
A	yeah
B	walking the dog or
B	I dunno and you just smile and they don't really show an interest in your life cos you're a child
A	yeah
B	cos in those days there were the clearly demarcated
A	definitely
B	boundaries between
A	yeah yes
B	and you're not really told anything
A	yeah
B	like I I remember when my dad left it was like oh you know dad is living in
B	and that was that you know
A	yeah
B	whereas nowadays the mum would tell oh you know
A	yeah
B	we've got these problems and
B	all my sexual problems and
B	you know that's the way it is now that's how my friends are with their kids they tell them everything
A	oh my god
B	we weren't told anything thank god you know
A	yeah
B	I didn't know what was going on
A	I know
B	it was just like oh
A	yeah
B	you're living here now oh okay you know
A	yeah
B	you're getting on the plane you're going oh okay you just
A	yeah just accept it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	quite funny
A	it is it is that's such a short space of time really
B	mm
A	the generational
B	one generation
A	yeah one generation what's happened?
B	some of my friends most of them are a bit older than me but not that much older than me who have got kids it's like oh you know we're best friends and I tell her everything and I'm thinking
A	yeah
B	oh my god thank god I was my generation that
A	yeah
B	I'd have hated to have been told everything
A	yeah yeah yeah totally yeah
B	I can't even cope now
B	I can't even process anything now and I'm forty-one you know
B	so god knows when I was eight years old
A	yeah
A	that's right
B	I know exactly
A	it's it's unprocessable in a way
B	exactly
A	it's just
B	no but that's exactly the
A	yeah that's right
B	take away quite from this whole
B	what am I meant to do with this information?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	for fuck's sake
B	it's terrifying
A	it is it is yeah but you're you're right it's it is it is erm I don't know
B	changing times
A	yeah
B	changing expectations
A	yeah
B	yeah but it's lovely just to have human contact
A	yeah and she's got all her worries or whatever
B	oh yeah
A	and then she doesn't make it out like but it is
B	oh no and sometimes it's nice to have
A	well I just said to her
B	a little insight into other people's woes
A	do you mind if we record the conversation and she said
B	oh wow
A	yeah go for it so that particular conversation
A	was about death families dealing with death
B	yeah
A	it was all about organising the funerals it was about
B	well we can move on to death later
A	alcoholism
A	it
B	I can do death
A	oh god
A	you know and it's just and and I
B	death's on the
A	I I replayed it and I thought
B	yeah
A	and
B	and yet she was prepared to divulge
A	not only does she want to talk to me
B	and disclose
A	but she really trusts me that you know
B	yeah
A	this isn't going to harm you
B	no
A	recording this conversation now I believe it isn't
B	yeah
A	and it's like well you know I I just thought to myself wow people
B	yeah
A	really engage and interact
B	and it's to do with making people feel at their ease
B	isn't it?
A	yeah I think so
B	it's stating the obviously but
A	yeah I think that's really important and I
B	yeah
A	I sometimes forget that
B	but most people don't have that knack
A	true yeah
B	but I think that because you've been brought up with a certain set of criteria that is supposed to define what being a great person is
A	yeah
B	and being a success is
A	yeah
B	it's quite hard to step back from that
A	yeah
B	and actually think no what really
A	yeah
B	are the criteria
A	or the
B	for being a decent person?
A	yeah that's it yeah yeah
B	and it's a message if people keep
A	yeah
B	hammering home this narrative
A	mm
B	it's very very difficult not to absorb that narrative
A	mm
B	because
A	mm
B	this has been your life
A	yeah yeah
B	but it doesn't mean it's true
A	yeah
B	it's like stating the obvious but
A	I know it's like
B	well things run their course
A	it it was just a readiness that I had
B	yeah yeah
A	to sort of switch
B	yeah
A	and change and
B	yeah
A	just
B	well the thing is
A	you know
B	it's like
A	just what I've always done you know
B	you could do anything at any time
A	yeah yeah
B	but you shouldn't be put under pressure
A	yeah yeah
B	in a
A	yeah
B	yes yes yes yes yes yeah
A	lovely
B	let's
