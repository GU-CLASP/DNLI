B	she's like
A	yeah exactly yeah but obviously if they do get more promotions it's because they're a girl like in terms of like what she's saying
B	yeah
A	that girls get more promotions in STEM
B	then actually it should be
A	well that's not even true
B	you get more promotions because of what you're doing
A	yeah exactly not because because you're a girl
A	that's so weird she's she's really confusing

A	right thanks
B	yeah but that's what
A	yeah I know
B	oh right I thought you were saying right thanks and I was like no no
A	no that's what I was

A	oh I know like sitting straight
B	and I'm just like
A	because it's so much
B	sometimes I realise like how bad my posture is when I'm sitting there in science like on the table and
A	you're sitting on the table?
B	yeah like when cos in physics basically he makes like every lesson going around and I just sit on the table like on this side and I'm sat there like this
A	yeah my posture is really bad like I sit on the sofa like this
B	yeah but I just lean I just lean forward like when I'm sitting I I can't like sit like this
