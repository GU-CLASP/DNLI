A	I'll have a little bit of erm a little bit of soft cheese sometimes
B	yeah I've never really thought about it as an option because I always drink so much milk in my tea and coffee like
A	mm I only I drink tea but I kind of like I drink tea in the morning
B	mm
A	and sometimes that's the only tea I drink because if I go to work I won't drink tea in a day like no
B	so that's a smidgen of milk isn't it?
A	mm
B	in one like one cup of tea
A	exactly and then I'll come back home and I won't have a tea in the evening most of the time because and if I want to I'll have green tea
B	erm yeah no that's a good option I need to drink more green tea and herbal teas really because
A	there's still caffeine in green tea and that's all you really
B	mm?
A	would that count though? well did it count
B	you know I never really thought about it cos it's it's a tea do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
A	mm
B	one has got like no calorific content whatsoever what does?
A	yeah if it's zero calories then you're alright so it'll be a sin because you'll have to count the calories and if it's zero it's nothing
B	yeah yeah hibiscus rosehip natural flavourings apple sweet blackberry leaves there's like no nutritional information
A	it's gonna be leaves isn't it? so
B	a flavour of leaves is it can't be much can it?
A	no
B	I wouldn't have thought so it's good to have one type of rice today because it was a bit of a faff to do the two types of rice
A	like what what do you mean?
B	because I did this red rice as well as the brown rice
A	okay
B	it's really tasty
A	mm
B	oh well it takes ages it takes like half an hour to boil
A	yeah it's like wild rice
B	yeah
A	have you had
B	did I?
A	no no I'm not
A	oh no
A	but this is my syrup
B	oh right
B	no I haven't
A	you can help yourself to it
B	is it a zero?
A	American
B	so like fake
A	and you need only a tiny bit
B	fake flavour it says here zero
A	mm
B	I said it
A	if you ever want something sweet
B	wow
A	or like syrup and on on porridge
B	it does smell like caramel in a really weird way
A	in like American
B	like like
A	way like Americans like
A	if you have something grape flavoured the Americans
A	and it just tastes artificial in a kind of nice way
B	yes
A	it's a little bit like that
B	slightly trashy
A	it's trashy sauce yeah
B	yeah trash sauce
A	if you ever wanna put it on like porridge or anything or like if you make magic pancakes you can just make them with an egg apparently you just whip up the egg whites and mix it in with the egg or something weird like that
B	oh
A	sin-free not really a pancake just a flat thing put you can put stuff on it though
B	like a little well
A	yeah they do though they do all sorts of stuff like that but you can make
B	oh the one
B	I had cauliflower pizza once and it was absolutely horrible really really disgusting
A	I've had cauliflower pizza and I was disappointed cos it smells of just no it
B	yeah cos like boiled cauliflower or cooked cauliflower it does have that smell that it has and
A	so
B	you know that you're just eating a big flat flat thing of cauliflower
A	but you could kind of like pimp it up a little bit and make it a bit garlicky or I suppose couldn't you? you could
B	you could pimp that up yeah
A	no
B	not this treat day
B	next treat day
A	mm
B	so we could like exercise in the morning and could come home and eat cauliflower cheese
A	yeah no actually what weekend is that? I'm going to
B	oh is that in erm that's February this is still January it's the
A	oh yeah yeah okay
B	thirteenth yeah
A	oh yeah yeah
B	so it's all
A	oh yes okay cool
B	it's all good not this weekend but the weekend after
A	I can't visualise dates very well I can't see them in my head
B	I I have a calendar on my desk and it really helps me cos I'm such a forgetful person you know how I I tell
A	mm
B	I haven't written in my lunch date for tomorrow I'm going to have lunch with
A	mm
B	so but I've told
A	mm
B	that sometimes goes wrong and I get the reminder at completely the wrong time and I'm like
A	mm
B	oh I don't know how it went wrong but that's definitely wrong
A	erm mm
B	yeah
B	cos I've never had
A	all about the rice but I love
B	well I like an interesting rice so I've never had a rice with cauliflower cheese before which and I don't know if that's weird to you?
A	mm
B	is it is it something that you
A	some people just haven't I'm all over it love it
B	it's just it's not tradition in my house
A	I loves it
B	I think it's meant to be like a handful per person but I put in
A	I dunno
B	two handfuls per person cos me and
B	rice brown rice no less
A	I don't know how much erm is in erm ketchup because I had a lot of ketchup yesterday
B	mm
A	and I had a dollop of ketchup and normally in place of that dollop of ketchup I'd have had a little slimming chocolate bar
B	ah
A	I don't know whether
B	no
A	it won't be be more than a little chocolate bar
B	no
B	yeah maybe
B	well you said you said this morning that you'd lost eight pounds this year
A	mm
B	so did you weigh yourself this morning and that's how much you've lost in total? that's amazing
A	well I got got on the scales and it said erm ten stone eight and I'm no and I was that the other day and I was like okay that's fine
B	yeah
A	but then I got back on it this morning and it said it again so I was like but exactly the same for the same quarter
B	so the same quarter wow
A	and I was like
B	that's a good system
A	I was like okay so I get off it so I gave it a kick like to see if maybe the floor or maybe it was just kind of stuck on the same weight as I got on and I got on again and it went ten stone six so I was like right better but it could be the floor
B	yeah
A	so I got I moved it around a lot and I got on
B	yeah
A	it again and I got on it again and it kept saying the same thing
B	I've done that for I I had three different readings the other morning
A	yeah
B	and one was lower and one was higher
A	obviously
B	and then the one in the middle
A	yeah
B	kept coming up over and over again when I moved it to a different point and I was like
A	yeah
B	and again and again and again
A	yeah getting on it
A	and I was like it it would be very strange for it to be precisely the same weight as the other day
B	yeah
A	when erm like to the same quarter of a pound
B	yeah
A	and erm so I thought I'll move it cos I expected it
B	yeah
A	and then well hopefully you know
B	yeah fingers crossed
A	I kept moving in that direction
B	yeah
A	so I moved it on the floor to a floor that because you know the floors are obviously the floorboards get creaky
B	yes
A	so maybe it was just sitting differently so I moved it a lot and I kept getting on it and moved it around and it just kept coming up with ten six
B	that's really good
A	my lowest last year was 10 five
A	oh do you know what? erm
B	yeah I mean I know but it actually does make a big difference and I have to
A	yeah
B	remind myself that
A	you are I am shorter
B	because yeah I just can't even imagine weighing that though
A	I just don't want to have the wobbly bits
B	mm
A	I'd feel like when I was like I was the size I was at
B	oh
A	and that's kind of like what it's all about
B	I think I was about twelve and a half at school
A	okay
B	and that's like when I look at people obviously at the time I thought I was huge a huge heffalump
A	I thought I was huge though
B	but isn't that ridiculous?
A	it is ridiculous
B	and then you look back and you're like
A	do you know what though? at school I wouldn't have walked around in a bikini I wouldn't though
A	so
B	no chance you'd have been mortified
A	I wouldn't have ever got in a bikini and walked around no I didn't at school
B	no I know I know
A	but I would
B	I did have that vision initially of just like
A	it would have been but it would have been inappropriate wouldn't it?
A	but I wouldn't have I wouldn't have just come to and got in a bikini but because now I'm bigger than that obviously I'm a bit like oh no
B	it's the curse of a teenager to be like the slimmest that you're
A	yeah
B	you're a teenager
A	but then it's the legs thing so really I just need to get my legs moving it's cardio rather than strength and stuff I need to do
B	do you think so? yeah
A	I read it online if you
B	no and it does build up yeah but like less
A	yeah it it does
B	yeah
A	but it's not like I'm just gonna put on like I'm doing the bike thing again now
B	you should do your special
A	oh god
B	that you were doing the other night
A	yeah
A	oh
B	where
A	it I don't I was just like ah ah
A	sofa cycling was good though I liked that erm but yeah do you know what part of it probably is though?
B	mm
A	it's probably because of my sister because she is significantly tinier
B	so that
A	and I'm not trying to be like that cos I don't
B	no no but
A	want to be
B	I think when you have a sister who is like significantly small that
A	her legs are too thin
B	I think I have like I think I I did see her when you
A	if you see her in skinny jeans her legs are like
B	I've always thought that
A	she yeah she is
B	yeah
A	erm
B	mm mm
B	mm
A	her legs are too skinny and she has admitted that she's been a bit obsessive generally
B	yeah
A	and then she is naturally thin she's slim she's a slim person
B	yeah I mean people people are
A	but you see you see her legs are really tiny
A	and it's like and hers are just like that
B	but you
A	I really don't
B	well if you're just happy you know if you've like accepted that you're not going to look like your sister
A	but I don't want to
B	cos you're different people you just want to be happy
A	cos that's stupid
B	with yourself
A	yeah so
A	it's that it's all there that's where it is now and it needs to come off there
B	I think yeah if you do that sofa cycling that'll be it
B	you know what I just need some amazing results from workouts in just a few months like not just not not
A	yeah
B	even not even when I'm jogging jogging on the spot because
A	why do we not just do this anyway?
B	yeah just like cook and jog
A	we could one day one one treat day we could get a really nice picnic but then
B	mm
A	we could go on a Boris bike around Hyde Park
B	let's do that that's a nice idea
A	why are we not doing that?
B	I think maybe treat day could also be like exercise day cos then you're like you know what?
A	and it's a day off
B	yeah exactly it's always a day off and you know how food always tastes better if you work for it like if you're really hungry
A	yeah
B	you're gonna appreciate that burger a lot more then
A	and we might not feel so shit after we've eaten it either
B	no because it'll be like necessary
A	and my appetite does get smaller but I always feel like just saying no put it all on all on
B	it's the greed of like oh I really want all the
A	oh we can oh we can
B	we can
B	I don't know if I'm meant to be doing anything else all I'm doing is boiling rice erm that takes ages
A	I'm done now
B	okay
A	I need to vomit
A	oh I'm gonna retch in the sink
B	it's full
A	oh dear let's go in the bin then
B	go in the mop bucket and like which I still haven't taken outside
A	it's alright
B	yeah it's like kind of handy though to have because I've been doing that too and go eh just get it
A	yeah maybe we should get you know one of the flat ones the cheap flat you know
B	that's the Swiffering type ones
A	and then just spray the floor a little bit and just go this and just of course spray it done
B	yeah
A	so it's not wet then
[ANNOTATION]	it is soggy	Contradiction
B	so true
A	so so true
B	a nice little
A	no
B	oh good there's lots of eggs
A	of course
B	of course
A	that's I I said though didn't I?
A	you'd go on this diet and
B	that's true you did say that and I love an egg
[ANNOTATION]	there are many eggs	Entailment
A	I love an egg and those ones are free as well
B	they're like added extra bickies
A	are they nice? are they nice?
B	they look nice yeah they look
[ANNOTATION]	it looks delicious	Entailment
A	oh they're big
B	they are big
B	I was gonna do some fish with this dinner
A	I'm gonna start buying frozen food you know but not frozen everything but
B	some things frozen are really handy
A	yeah I'm gonna just start buying Quorn and put it because
B	yeah
A	but I'm thinking I might cancel all that fresh box already because it's just
B	yeah I did think that's a particularly big healthy looking broccoli but two pounds?
A	yeah just
[ANNOTATION]	they are not going to buy a fresh box	Entailment
B	yeah
A	but it's like
B	no
A	I might as well because it's organic and it's not
B	yeah that's so true
[ANNOTATION]	the frozen food is all organic	Neutral
A	yeah
B	and it's like oh no now it's gone off instantly
A	yeah and like as good as good as it is to eat organic and stuff at the same time I'm a little bit like well if you throw enough of it out which I hope not to and that's why I've got
B	yeah yeah
A	I like the novelty it's the novelty that's
B	I know I ordered some one of these eat fresh boxes and and I did it for like a week or two but I was like actually it's not worth the money
A	yeah I might keep
B	mm that is one of the things though like I I used to when we were talking about though where does your money go when you've got plenty of money? because like I was on more money at
B	one thousand seven hundred I think I was on
A	yeah
B	and erm but obviously you know saving for the wedding and everything and then I would I spent fifty pounds a month on gym membership and there were all sorts of
A	you just do don't you? you kind of
B	like hair appointments
A	is it within your means? yeah oh I'll do it then
B	yeah going for like waxes and things before my honeymoon and it all just added up to the point where I just didn't feel any better off than I do now on on less money
A	is it is erm the thing though isn't it like there's only a certain amount you can earn where you just start living differently
B	yeah
A	so like say you could be on like fifty grand a year right but you're not gonna live any better than somebody on thirty grand a year because you'll just have a better car you'll have a more expensive car
B	it's true and then there's tax
A	and you'll have a more expensive rent
B	it's true it's true you'll just you'll get a nicer car and a nicer house
A	but you'll live the same
B	but you
A	it won't make you happier
B	most of it goes in erm goes in taxes and I like I was paying a lot more tax and paying back my student loan a lot more at
A	mm
B	at all and I'm paying tax but they taxed me a stupid amount when I arrived and now they can't charge me any more because I've basically I've paid all the tax that I should in a whole year in one go
A	yeah yeah put on emergency tax so you would get a rebate until it balanced out
B	yeah and now it's like my wages just go in and I just get it
A	mm
B	apart from when it doesn't work and
A	I pay a little bit national insurance
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	okay yeah and then swap
A	so she so yeah there is a childcare issue for her and so so actually though the reason that I'm not allowed to work there is literally it would take her three hours every evening oh no on the Thursday evening they won't have a dispenser because in three hours I
A	they're so stupid
B	so I'm I texted her saying do you reckon
B	uhu
A	because then moving her hours it would make it so it's literally three hours
B	yeah
A	erm
B	that's that's like nothing and you're saying you could get your work done way ahead of time so
A	I could get it done by five and then I'll be out the door earlier but if I just happened to stay later
B	if they're willing to be flexible it would save them money
A	mm exactly and then so like it's like either they have me like apparently my the two pharmacists there's
B	yeah
A	you pick arguments with me and anyway but he's a snake right? but then there's
B	he would be it
A	right erm but he even picked up
B	but for way more time yeah the three hours
A	yeah you've just made it worse
B	did she say that to him?
A	no he said that to no he
B	oh
A	and so
B	ah okay phew
A	so she's just responded to what
B	yeah
A	I'm an old school now
B	yeah you look better in dispenser now
A	yeah because I was I was taught the old school way
B	yeah
A	and then they changed it so that now people are learning stuff on the computer but then they're never actually doing the practice so no one's any good like
B	mm
A	and so she's saying
A	it's just ridiculous I wish I could get
B	I am
A	well part of me says that I don't even want that job now
B	yeah yeah I know because like you'd have to work for her and
A	uhu
B	and
A	if it wasn't that
B	yeah yeah you can look at it that way as well and just think well I was a little bit like that at
A	mm
B	so I was like I'd rather jump before I was pushed
A	yeah that's like how I feel yeah and so if someone knows that so that
B	yeah
A	and so part of me just thinks do you know what? she'd looked after
B	mm
A	and now she's helping me again just
B	such a nice person
A	yeah
B	yeah well it's good but like the
A	mm it's corporate companies though and my friend that I was talking to when I go to
B	yeah
A	she said when I described it to her she said that's how it was at
B	oh yeah?
A	cos cos she used to work in
B	yeah
A	in the game part
B	mm
A	because they're not willing to just pander to it and then you're just left with people that
B	yeah yeah I think that's the big company structures erm they don't seem to work well for people like keeping good people
A	no
B	like it's not it it's not structured that way
A	because they're not they don't run morally they run regarding numbers and I was saying though to my friend that like I I don't believe that you can have it both ways if you've got targets I don't believe that you have to be a strict manager and to achieve those targets
B	no
A	and you're kind of diplomatic and you respect your staff and help them out where you can they will help you out and cos then you're just putting
B	yeah
A	as long as you make everyone happy in their work
B	yeah absolutely it's
A	and you wouldn't have to be one of these managers that goes around threatening you shouldn't manage by threatening
B	threatening people does not work no
A	to achieve what they should be achieving you should
B	I work rather well with the
A	I yeah
A	I work well if I've got someone I'm actually like who is actually gonna say thank you
B	yeah
A	because the thing is I was also saying to erm her though as in my friend
B	aha
A	erm that if so we have stupid targets
B	yeah
B	but that wouldn't be
A	and there would be no recognition
B	nothing for that yeah that's stupid
A	and mine mine is a job where and
B	yeah
A	don't come in and just take all that away from me about being a nice you know being a good person and doing the actual caring
B	yeah
A	side of the job well
B	like actually focusing on completely the wrong aspect
A	yeah
B	of like what should essentially be a caring profession really
A	everything everything is removed from like the focus is should be on caring and stuff and that's completely removed by having erm me doing a tally chart of the things I've done that day
A	and it's all hit and miss because they don't have many customers so erm is that Cajun?
B	yeah
B	oh cine is it?
A	cine
B	oh
A	give it a bit of erm have you just got a bit of cayenne pepper?
B	yeah cayenne pepper paprika chilli powder
A	yeah I saw something online
B	yeah
A	and they said put Cajun spice in it and then they quickly just made the Cajun spices like yeah why am I not doing that?
B	yeah
A	it's good for erm
B	yeah it's just like when you you're like having a shortcut aren't you?
A	yeah you'd assume it would be the same wouldn't you?
B	you would assume it
A	that's why I bought it I assumed it was that
B	yeah and you're just like oh it's a spice mix they've just mixed the spices together and I'm just being lazy and and it won't like cost me anything yes it will
A	it's got like yeah I think
B	yeah
A	nice manager
B	yeah
A	because you also
B	yeah that's really important it's really important
A	cos I know it's a business and I know it's
B	that's good
A	that's a pretty high target what's their issue?
B	that's really good
A	you ain't gonna be you're not gonna be number one you're not so
B	no
A	we're not the flagship we're not gonna be number one I know you should always do your best and everything but don't look at thirty-ninth and go that's bad
B	no
A	yeah when you've got people who are in stores not doing quite as well but they're all happy and their
B	no
A	staff are happy and no one ever leaves it's all uncomplicated and they all help each other out
B	and like what's what's important to you as a person as well like?
A	yeah
B	like as a human being?
A	I think to be nice is just standard and you should be and it's nice when you when you've been nice
B	are these your peas or our peas?
A	erm I have peas but have them are mine not near the top?
B	yeah there are two sets of peas cos I was sure we had peas and me
A	I don't think we actually have opened ours but either way just use whatever
B	okay so
A	if it turns into communal peas
B	okay cos I was sure that we had peas
A	yeah you do have peas there's two bags of peas
B	yeah
A	we had one and you had one
B	do you have soya beans?
A	no
B	yeah I think
A	so I don't have one of those little clips
B	aha oh there's some down here if you do want them
A	and I don't think I opened the peas so
B	yeah there's an unopened peas and an opened peas and I was like I'm sure I've got an open peas and we didn't eat
A	those are peas and I think you should have them
B	I'm gonna have some peas
A	I'm even telling you those are your peas but regardless don't worry they're just peas
B	even if they weren't my peas thank you
A	they're your peas
B	they're they're totally my peas aren't they?
A	mm
A	oh you know when you've put it in and it just sort of sticks straightaway even though
B	yeah I'm gonna blacken it
A	I'm watching you cos I don't eat meat
B	yeah
A	and life could be a bit easier sometimes I think if I did
A	more choice I think
B	yeah there's more choice sorry if it makes you cough
B	frying spices now
A	mm
A	yeah
B	moisture to it is there?
A	no but sometimes though I start things up with
B	ah
A	and it keeps drying out?
B	yeah you know Quorn chicken pieces are really bad for that sometimes no it's not that
A	I find mushrooms are bad for that
B	mushrooms?
A	sometimes
A	to be honest though it's because I've been using a metal pan and not a non-stick pan
B	mm
B	non-stick is the boss I love this pan so much
A	yeah
B	and it really
A	I bought mine because I needed new pans and I didn't like the way that my existing non-stick had been scratched erm but then I realised actually because somebody who I won't name right?
A	erm who are not actually stays with me anymore
B	yes
A	came around and offered to do my washing up and I was like no no no put I'll put it in the dishwasher and scrubbed it with a with a metal thing
B	with a Brillo pad?
A	yeah
B	no that's so annoying oh
A	and so then they all just I just didn't
B	well once they're already like a bit ruined you don't do you?
A	no
B	why did you do it by hand?
A	oh my god you've ruined my pans
B	thanks for nothing
A	oh that's
B	that's very minimal you could add more food
A	I could do but I'm a bit mm
B	yeah
A	I'll have a banana actually as well
B	oh no
B	I saw there's lemon squash in the door normally
A	yeah
B	I might need your garlicky cubes
A	yeah I think you should
B	yeah a bit of an epic one
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	one bit
B	just one
A	and it was only the it was
B	yeah
A	and then then I got an an answerphone message saying no they've got nothing
B	yeah
A	they had nobody there so I said that erm so I messaged her and I was like is this
A	who's
A	I'm sure this is someone I know
B	yeah oh
B	that would be so
A	and
B	yeah you must get all sorts of people
A	it's either really busy or really intense because everyone's in a hurry
B	aha
A	or
B	yes
B	wow
B	okay
B	no
A	well blame
B	yeah blame
A	mm
B	oh
A	it's more like the five-a-day today
B	mm
A	I might have erm I've got broccoli I've got a big broccoli
B	you've got lots of broccoli
A	I've got some carrots and then I might roast some potatoes with that rosemary
B	oh lovely
A	yeah
B	fancy some rosemary we do have a rosemary bush
A	mm
B	yeah I've got a big bush there rosemary
A	have you got any mint to go with
B	no we don't have mint
A	you should grow mint it grows like wildfire though
B	it does yeah I it's funny that we don't have mint we've got sage and rosemary and that's gone mental over those things
A	mm
B	yeah
A	you can't kill the stuff you can't get rid of it
B	no it's really
A	so we just ended up utilising it but we had to really cut it back all the time
B	we yeah yeah and some some herbs are really hardy
A	and also though it was very growing from behind the next door's shed
B	yeah
A	so we didn't even know it was there
A	so like there wasn't even any way of saying can can we like get
B	ah yeah
A	it was like you know when you're just trying to even out your garden and just make it so it was just lawn?
B	yeah
A	we were nearly there just apart from this one mint
