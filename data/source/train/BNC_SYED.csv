C	mm
D	replaced it
B	erm you know my outside tap?
C	mm
B	it's just dripping I just can't stop it dripping
C	mm
B	I can't get it to fix no matter how hard I turn the tap and how hard I turn
C	mm
B	that thing onto it it
C	mm
D	mm
B	we do need to contact the erm the aftercare team anyway cos our back doors are catching they catch it on the frame and on the floor
C	mm
B	they're just like two millimetres too high no too low for the floor and no sorry one millimetre too low for the floor
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B tries hard to fix a damage.	Entailment
C	mm
B	the
C	mm
B	and two
D	well this is why when I remember I asked you about it being where the bolts go in at an offset angle?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The tap is very old.	Neutral
D	I'm thinking this isn't quite right when I was there so
B	mm and erm
C	it's this signing off before you move in
A	mm
C	this signing off before you move in
B	oh yeah
C	is ludicrous
A	I know
C	you need to live in the space
A	well the thing is technically apparently now we're at an advantage cos cos we go through customer care it effectively gets like escalated
C	mm
A	and they can draft in erm site
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Before moving in, people need to sign some papers.	Entailment
A	erm whereas if we went to our site manager he could only draft people on that was on his like
C	mm
A	and only as and when they were available
[ANNOTATION]	The site manager is from Sweden.	Neutral
C	mm
A	he couldn't pull them off other jobs for example
C	no
A	so it kind of just gets like left cos it's not a priority
C	yeah
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The site manager have the power to do anything concerning his occupation.	Contradiction

A	okay it's it's not very big is it? it
A	it won't take much at all but she just doesn't have a clue
C	does
B	garage garage door there rose bush
A	I think she just wants something easy but something that will look pretty
C	yeah
B	probably needs to be cut down to regrow but as it is at the moment it
A	yeah
D	come up with something
B	a lot of weeds and
C	do you like the dahlias? you see they're still going aren't they? but
A	yeah they're really nice I just think she wants something that's gonna be relatively easy to maintain
C	yeah
A	but will look nice
D	well that that unfortunately is an annual thing because obviously I grow those from seed
A	yeah
D	but they will form tubers I dig them up make sure they dry off alright and then you get through the winter okay they'll start shooting in the spring and I put them back in but slugs and snails love them
A	mm
C	yeah
B	so yeah your your mum wants some things that she can just pop in there which will come back every year absolutely fine and then I think she'd be happy with bedding plants going in once a year
C	yeah
D	I mean you know
A	a couple of
A	er maybe like some sort of like bushier type things that are just gonna fill it up a little bit
C	ceanothus
B	no no you don't want bushy stuff because no because they get too big like your front garden did and like the stuff in the back did
A	okay but okay perhaps not quite to that scale but just something that's gonna like fill it out a little bit
B	er it's a bit like er it's a bit like
B	and she's not interested
C	mm
A	no
B	it's she's not interested in gardening
A	she wants something easy
C	yeah
A	but it's it's currently got a lot of weeds in it so
D	who's
C	who's
B	I said
C	wants something easy
B	well er
C	our

B	was it?
D	yeah
C	oh yeah she didn't empty the filter
B	you did you ask if she had?

D	yeah
A	surely I'm I swear they're gonna have to buy a er build a bungalow
B	build a bungalow
A	because that cos it er it's
A	I'm
B	so there's there's they'll be next they'll be across the lane from their cottage in the back garden of a bungalow next to a bungalow so there's two bungalows there
D	yeah
B	they won't
A	I don't really
B	they won't be able to have any window space in
A	I'm taking all my knowledge from Grand Designs
D	all all
D	sorry they
C	I like
B	the the the guy from
A	oh yeah yeah
C	from the North East that's why I like
B	from from
A	but erm the one who likes er all the fascinating spaces and all that kind of yeah
C	yeah
D	but they they start off they start off with a building plot
B	yeah
D	okay it's brown site so it's brown field cos it's in a within a residential area so it's not new
C	excuse me
A	mm
D	however as you've just
B	yeah
A	mm
C	of
D	of
A	yeah
D	that's what I mean
B	well it would be on his on his land
D	that's what I mean
B	er yeah
D	but anybody in the area can object now the only people that tend to get
C	no I
B	there's only one where's the other one?
D	what's that?
B	one chicken
A	they hang out like in the sunflowers and wherever else that's they've been all over the place
D	erm so really it's hard it's hard to say it is more than likely they would only allow a bungalow
A	yeah
D	but if nobody objects
A	it might be okay I can't quite get my head round where what what bit they mean
C	I don't know
B	you know where the gate is into theirs? near near the actual house
C	yeah
C	mm
B	no no no
D	no no no no
A	the other end?
C	mm
D	near the extension
A	near the actual
D	yeah
A	near the actual house?
D	yeah
C	there is
A	yeah
C	yeah the one you go through to go and see the alpaca
A	the land
C	yeah is that where it is?
A	like where the chickens and like down from where the chickens are?
B	so
A	yeah
B	on the right-hand side if you're walking towards the chickens
A	yeah
C	mm
D	so it's
A	yeah
D	cottage is here
A	yeah
D	there's a bungalow there
B	mm
D	and alpacas are there
A	yeah
C	there's some land in there
B	mm
D	it's
A	okay
D	it's like chopping the back off
A	yeah
B	weird
A	that's quite a commitment
C	you know where
A	I think it's onto the lane
D	it's it's onto the lane
C	is it?
A	yeah
D	that's the whole garden
B	cos they've got a lane that splits the two bungalows as well
A	and er yeah they've got a lane that goes right round
C	uhu
D	yeah
C	mm
A	mm
C	you know er where the where their cottage is? you know the other cottage the people in that cottage?
D	I
B	no
C	no
B	er he owns he owns half of that
C	half of?
D	he owns yeah so he owns the cottage
C	oh okay
A	mm
D	I don't think I think this whole thing is so they don't leave
A	yeah it's it's it ties them down for er
C	well a few years
A	well because the thing is it is one of those things it's like obviously part of the condition is that they can only sell it back to
B	yeah
A	which is a bit dangerous really isn't it?
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	so if they decide to sell it that's fine sell it to him
C	uhu
D	well obviously as long as that is er as long
C	it's something to do with inheritance tax
D	yeah
A	oh okay
D	it's at a fair market price
B	well I presume it will be
D	yeah but they have to have that written in put in writing
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's all to do with inheritance tax
D	because you know at the end of the day and although you don't like to say this if something happened to and I know it's all very incestuous the way it is but if something happened to
C	mm
D	who they sell it to
A	yeah
D	er although
C	I think
D	yeah
C	I don't think
A	well that's but that's the awkward thing to look at
A	exactly
A	if if something happens and they decide to break up
D	he can't sell
A	he can't sell the house
C	I know
D	he can't get
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	she wouldn't cos it's on her
D	I think it's an appalling idea
A	yeah
D	but er that's not up to me
A	I think they've
C	yeah
A	and have er er I imagine over dinner at some point somebody's mentioned it as a bit of a joke and it's just been
C	he's
A	oh okay
D	yeah but it's all yeah but but the
A	mm maybe
D	yeah but it's the point is when you're talking about inheritance inheritance
C	it's difficult
D	inheritance tax
C	mm
D	to
D	so fine so
C	all they're helping all the
B	oh shut up
C	oh sorry it's
B	have you even spoken to them about it?
C	no
B	cos you're talking like
B	so none of you have actually spoken to them about it?
D	I have
D	I had over half an hour on the phone talking about it
B	why are you missing feathers round your face?
C	oh are you talking?
D	well I think it's because they actually haven't got feathers round their now you're gonna have to watch it
B	why?
C	cos they're they're bold and this is a new carpet
C	she comes into the utility don't want her to come into where you
D	they come and they come and lick
C	very bold she's very very bold thank you thank you
B	who's that? that's
C	now then we're just thinking dad
E	yeah?
C	we might pop down and have a look at the bungalow
E	yes
C	what do you think?
E	oh
C	okay? there is a there is a pudding but
C	when we transferred ovens it went in the top oven and the grill was on not the oven so the top's a bit burnt so
C	we'll give it a break and we'll come back when we're a bit more hungry it's the sort of pudding you've got to be hungry to eat
C	it's quarter to three
D	oh yeah no problem
