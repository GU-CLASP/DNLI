A	I think it would be good though
B	oh yeah um
A	like I think
B	uh no the the have we had the Grammys yet or?
A	um
B	uh oh I might  I might  have read that in uh
A	I think she uh I'm sure they were like I dunno last night or something you know really quite recently
B	yeah
A	are the Grammys not more of like a music thing or are they
A	put a bit of water in
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	christmas Day of it yeah
B	um there's sort of like a big build up and um
A	I think they need a bit longer
B	Cos uh
A	it's sticking to my food
B	can eat them raw can't you?
A	well
B	so and then the use the other  the other  ceremonies to predict who's gonna win the Oscars don't they?
A	well I think The Artist won loads of stuff so I bet they
B	yeah The Artist um
A	think I should put some garlic in with them? Or d'you not like it when it's roasted?
B	yeah why not we got a lot
A	be stinking at work tomorrow
A	well more than usual I should say
B	well d'you sit near people? Uh
A	quite near people
B	do they  do they  like garlic?
A	well everyone likes garlic but not on other people you know
B	um
A	ah I can't believe her
B	says it smells of sewage
A	no way
B	I can see there is
B	I can see there is some similarity between you know garlic and and
A	sewage?
B	A bit I mean
A	I think it's really nice
B	but um
A	sewage though?
B	I don't even think she likes uh garlic bread which I thought everyone liked garlic bread
A	every one must
B	yeah I think she's fairly fairly fussy
A	yeah you don't say
B	but
A	mm?
B	the most fussy person um
A	mm
B	uh
A	nothing wrong with bread cheese and tomato like
B	yeah
A	but you think that I'm fussy and everyone that I know thinks that I'm not fussy so maybe you just eat absolutely everything
B	yeah I I do eat um
A	I think your family were surprised that I was fussy and and whereas like in my family I'm the least fussy
B	yeah
A	well
B	well there's some things you say you don't like but you actually do
A	I would eat anything like if
B	well that's good
A	like there's not many things that I couldn't like just force in
B	yeah
A	but there's some things that I wouldn't choose
B	yeah
A	so
A	no that's green beans but I seemed to have conquered that
A	I don't really like boiled vegetables just on their own like dry like a dry boiled carrot
B	it's got strange things in it
A	I don't really like that very much
B	yeah have a bit of salt on it wouldn't you?
A	no but I think it needs like a sauce or a gravy or something
B	yeah yeah
A	but um
A	it's not too keen on me
B	doesn't agree with you
A	doesn't agree with us
B	it's good
A	I know I wonder what it is
B	it it means that we can't buy you know packs of uh frozen seafood or other types of seafood mixes
A	seafood mix
A	but what happened like?
B	I dunno
A	ooh shall I put these Cream Eggs in the fridge? They'll go all warm on the top of the next to the oven
B	yeah
A	really is Easter when you buy Cream Eggs
B	uh sorry?
A	it really is Easter when you buy a Cream Egg
B	is it? Is that do
A	that's my
B	yeah
A	but when is Easter? It's not even that long
B	nearly time for the uh nearly nearly time for the cricket season
A	when does that start then?
B	well
A	I thought it was on all the time

B	the none
A	right
B	that was uh read about that yesterday
A	should I cook the fish now d'you think?
B	yeah yeah stick it on
B	um
A	not very long
B	Don't think you need any oil in it
A	I think a little bit
B	it is fairly oily by itself
A	I know but I don't want it to stick
B	um
A	yeah it was good
B	how many times did you? Did you go a few times did you?
A	I just went once yeah
B	just once
A	uh yeah
B	versus?
A	I'd had a whole bottle of wine hadn't I so
B	okay
A	um
B	twenty-twenty
A	yeah
B	the overs
A	so it's like a day match
B	yeah
A	but it was alright
B	yeah
A	there was  there was  wine so
B	is it actually in it's actually in
A	it's in
B	I say
A	okay
B	um
A	it's cos you're not local
B	but it's actually
A	that's very true
B	meaning meaning something like the street of
A	I don't know
B	or or just
A	I'm not sure of its geographic orientation no
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's true
B	on the bus the purple bus
A	oh yeah
B	and uh
A	we should go back
B	they seem to have been exploiting the colour purple quite quite well those
A	did they? I don't remember
B	the bus was purple wasn't it?
A	was it?
B	I thought it was
A	they have them round here like green busses and blue busses and stuff
B	something to do with the bishops and purple
A	oh the Prince Bishops? Land of the Prince Bishops?
B	something like that yeah
A	yeah
B	so you can uh
A	yeah or four beers
B	but no no more than that then? Or
A	no
A	I don't mean the place
B	oh yeah concert price
A	concert not
B	Cos obviously
A	only you would get that ambiguity
B	in your accent  in your accent  the they're the same aren't they?
A	but that's
B	no I was just thinking of
A	how do you know about
B	because it it was mentioned um on some work I did but also uh it's
A	I didn't know you were such a avid fan
B	no I wasn't yeah they just mentioned it in something
A	no it's not hot enough
B	you gotta have it uh put it up to eleven
A	no put it on the nine
B	Cos like you gotta put it you gotta do it until that red thing goes and you know all the lines disappear
A	see-through
B	so obviously you need it on
A	ah
B	and then you lower it once it's reached top heat cos you've gotta get the heat all
A	alright Heston
B	so it's quite a thick pan to take
B	um
A	have you seen that Heston programme? Did you watch the one about cooking an egg? Heston shows you
B	yeah
A	get a nice fresh egg yeah
B	you don't need to put vinegar in and then
A	yeah
B	and then filter it
A	but no one wants to know how to cook like Heston no one's like d'you know what? I'll just go and get some dry ice for the family dinner
A	yeah he does but no one wants to cook like Heston though do they?
B	depends what he's doing I I mean I don't wouldn't want like a frozen worm or something
A	exactly
B	but some of his stuff is is really good
A	like a souffl√© with like a scarecrow scarecrow's eyeball in the top or something
B	um
A	yeah
B	ear of  ear of  uh turkey
A	yeah
B	why do witch
A	that's more like it
B	yeah
A	this is not gonna take very long I don't think
B	did you just put salt and pepper on them?
A	no
B	oh right
A	I've put them on the the top side
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A used seasoning in the centre..	Contradiction
B	yeah maybe although it might then be hard to get the bones out cos uh the bones are quite
A	yeah
B	so yeah I normally would put salt I mean uh that's bit bits of black you know grains on top of the fish before frying it just because cos I had that in a restaurant once
A	on the bottom side? I know
B	on that side yeah
A	sorry
B	yeah that was at Simply French
A	maybe they'll have something similar in
B	yeah looking forward to that um
A	yeah I think they've got some nice things
[ANNOTATION]	It's easy to remove the bones.	Contradiction
B	uh are
A	well
B	Cos uh
A	shall I turn them over or leave them or what?
B	yeah flip them over and then salt the back
A	sorry
B	um
[ANNOTATION]	Salt needs to be added to the other side.	Entailment
A	I think they should be more crispy
B	you don't have to turn them over
A	oh right right
B	too much  too much  flipping in order to uh
A	whoops
B	I'll have a go
B	it's tricky innit?
A	ah
A	that one's yours
A	thank you
B	D'you watch that programme about uh where they did? The kids went to like teenagers went um went on holiday?
[ANNOTATION]	Mainly fish is not cooked very nice if being consistently flipped.	Neutral
[ANNOTATION]	Food is not cooked very nice if being consistently flipped.	Neutral
A	ah it was awful
B	and uh they uh
A	that was so embarrassing
B	the the the parents  the parents  were sort of
A	oh
B	uh were allowed to watch the the them being filmed and they got really drunk
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A didn't like the teen show speaker B mentioned.	Entailment
A	imagine if that was you
B	well it's just really sort of
A	oh that's nice
B	it's just really sort of um
A	didn't wanna overcook them
B	oh yeah no I mean they look really done now don't they?
A	want to take them out?
B	it's sort of crazy what they were doing cos they were  they were  being filmed but they were just going crazy and
A	I just couldn't do that like if you I mean like never mind if you thought your parents wouldn't watch but even if you thought like if you were being filmed then you wouldn't do it would you? Like gyrate and
B	it's they
A	you got your
B	then there were the parents actually
A	yeah
A	bet they had a bit of a their eyes opened a bit
B	when they  when they  finished it off at the end they got into like a massive fight between the the two groups of teenagers the boys and the girls
A	yeah
B	and uh
A	some people behave so badly like
B	yeah it's pretty amazing to behave like that while you're being filmed
A	crackers isn't it?
B	it's as if really isn't enough ways that you could threaten
B	ways that you could sort of threaten people to behave better maybe
A	yeah they look alright don't they?
B	yeah
A	um
B	I like uh put that vinegar
A	dunno if yoghurt'll do it but
B	uh
A	yeah
B	some beans
