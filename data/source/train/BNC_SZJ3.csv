D	it's that goes back
C	he's slowly buying up some of the shops there and what he wants to do is to turn them round so that what is the horrible backs
B	mm
C	becomes a really nice front
D	good for him because I mean the
C	well or try to
D	the planners have made a real mess of
C	oh
D	I mean when I first came to
C	they've got a lot to answer for

C	mm
D	er you know
C	yeah
D	administrations at
C	well yeah
A	I was telling
D	yeah
A	the greengrocers which was what
A	well er
C	oh

D	er before that
A	well it was Burton's actually well before
D	yeah
A	and we used to we used to go in and my mum used to drive us all in as kids in her erm
C	no no
A	but that was the main street
D	mm
A	it wasn't all built around where the
D	no no no
B	cos
A	no that's not completely true
B	oh not completely true
A	it's not true
D	but the I mean
A	and you'd go in there and your and mother would
B	and she has a pony you know
A	would order the
D	yeah

D	it's not on is it now anyway?
A	yeah it is
D	oh is it? oh
D	not for the first time
C	it's a bit of a strong Birmingham accent coming out
B	mm
D	yes
A	and then it would all be delivered
D	yeah that's right I mean it was
A	and sometimes if it was
D	even a weekend
A	going to be a long shop my mum was putting through cos she'd be talking and Mrs
B	mm
A	where she'd pay and they'd have all the
B	mm
A	papers on a spike
D	oh I
B	oh
D	I remember all that I remember all that
A	but I used to
B	mm
A	I used to
B	yeah
A	dash off and go down to Woolworths to spend me pocket money on a
D	oh Woolies yeah down
B	yes
A	on the latest erm record
B	mm
A	cos we used to have Woolworths there
D	yeah I remember that
B	yeah yeah
D	mm
A	and do you remember
B	and a and a Smith's and a Smith's
A	yeah there used to be a Smith's
D	Smith's where was that?
B	down
A	yeah
D	oh what?
B	opposite Woolworth's
C	yeah
B	so do you reckon this revival is gonna work?
A	and Gladworth's there used to
D	dunno I'd like to think it would because it's
B	because
D	it's a great shame they've messed it about so much
B	but it I thought it's
C	there is some really nice architectural properties
B	mm
C	in
D	yes
C	if you know what I mean I when I say the wrong place they're not in the main hub of the centre of the town the main hub the centre of the town is like you've just said
B	mm
C	the function was we want to create a little bypass round the main street so we can make it pedestrianised great idea
B	mm
C	so they take the road round the back but the road round the back then faces the back of all the shops
B	yes
D	mm
C	and I mean that could be so attractive
D	and it was originally planned to
C	to make it the shop frontage
D	yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	there was gonna be more stuff along there and they never did it I mean this is when it was first mooted
C	right
D	but originally when I first came they were gonna take the bypass the other way round and a I mean
C	oh
D	I dunno but behind there was gonna go all round the back there
C	oh
D	and come out where the lion's hut is
C	right
D	but for some reason they never did
C	mm
D	erm
C	it's a classic I mean I'm sure people doing architecture of landscaping or whatever town and country planning
D	yeah
C	how not to do it
D	well it's been quoted in several architectural books
C	has it?
D	yes
C	oh
D	yeah
A	but then why did they continue with that building if l thought they realised their mistakes with the library and the
D	mm
D	well
A	monstrosity
D	exactly yeah I mean
A	I mean you'd have thought they'd have learnt
D	well
B	mm
D	yes of course they should have learnt
A	cos that's recent so why have they done that?
D	well I
C	there's some interesting news today
D	is there?
A	we were there last night
C	a solar wind farm
A	yeah we were there last night
C	yeah
A	and
D	how did it go?
A	congratulations go to
C	yeah
A	because the other idiots they were really shown up
C	do you know she had to she had to get security
D	oh well I'd I I'm sorry we missed it cos
A	I
C	yeah well I'm I'm I'm sure it's public knowledge now isn't it that they haven't got permission
C	oh we were there yeah
C	yeah right yeah
D	but we I asked
B	but that surprises me that
A	but she was er
C	was she?
A	she was very confident she answered every question and she was
C	oh that's good
A	and she was she answered it er naturally and with intelligence
C	yeah
A	and her mate erm
D	I'll tell you what we have spent
