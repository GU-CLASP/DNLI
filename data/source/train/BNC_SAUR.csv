C	do the mushrooms not taste very good?
D	er not how I've done them I thought they would be okay but they weren't I can eat them but they I wouldn't put them in my curry
C	that's fair how did you do them?
D	er well I did em with some tomato with some coriander and a bit of curry and a bit of paprika
C	yeah
D	you know with curry it's not you
C	it smells good
D	mm yeah
C	do you ever dish up dad?
D	er only if
C	yeah
D	then I'll dish up if not she'd normally dish things up for
C	it's not not your role?
D	well it's just erm she does it better than me she's better at erm
B	no it's just that
D	er proportionality
B	I'm better at even shares
[ANNOTATION]	The dishwasher is broken.	Neutral
D	you're better at proportionality
C	ah does dad just pile it on his and then nothing left for anyone else?
B	that's it
C	what are you having
B	I'll do some fish fish fingers
C	fish fingers?
B	I love curry don't get me wrong but
B	so
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B cannot stand curry.	Contradiction
C	does it give you a bad stomach?
B	sometimes yeah really sort of
C	no that's fair
D	what time erm er have they given you any more details?
A	which seat's mine?
C	whichever one you want
D	erm
B	not the one with the blackcurrant
C	yeah this one well thank you very much
D	I wouldn't go with the mushrooms
C	so I can grab a piece?
D	yeah
C	that's alright yeah? thank you very much
[ANNOTATION]	Indian people eat a lot of curry.	Neutral
D	so this is
C	great thank you
D	without mushrooms
C	is this a green curry?
D	well it would er that would've been red but erm
C	yeah I was gonna say it's not very green
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The curry is a little bit red.	Entailment
A	spicy
A	can I have some bread?
D	mm yeah help yourself
A	that one's kind of big
D	yeah go for it
[ANNOTATION]	The bread is whole wheat.	Neutral
A	yeah mm
C	dad's on a diet he doesn't need much
D	mm
A	alright
D	mm
C	looks good thank you
D	well some of the lemongrass is homegrown the kaffir limes is from the tree
C	yeah
D	homegrown
C	you can taste the kaffir lime
A	it smells really good
D	mm cos the erm garlic is from the garden so is the peppery jalapeño
C	how much kaffir lime did you put in?
D	erm probably about four leaves
C	yeah
D	you can taste the lime
C	mm got a very distinct flavour
D	mm
C	kaffir lime
D	because I've never been to Thailand I don't know what the Thai curries are like but they're obviously using these ingredients
C	mm
D	but it's probably different
C	it varies a lot in Thailand
D	it probably won't taste better than the best you've had but it'll probably take better than the worst you had
C	oh definitely
A	I've had some pretty bad curries in Thailand
C	this tastes good to me taste's great
A	you know erm
C	do you want us to wait for you
B	no not at all
C	no?
A	you know in Korea they kinda add this hot stuff to all their foods and it kinda leaves like er at the top of the water there's kinda like a a red
C	oily residue
A	yeah
D	that'll be chilli
A	is that just chilli?
D	mm
A	oh right
C	sesame oil chilli chilli flakes
A	they like putting that in Thai curries
C	yeah
A	in some places sometimes they put in so much it was unbearable though
D	mm apart from a tiny bit of cumin there's no other curry spices in here it's it's chilli
C	mm
D	as it's a bit it's not
C	it's not Sriracha is it? do you know Sriracha?
A	no
C	the sauce it's like a Thai sauce American's really like it it's like a red spicy sauce
A	may've been that
C	could be Sriracha
A	it's quite hot
C	I don't think it's the same in Thailand than it is in Korea
D	so I've departed from erm using
C	the Thai ones? no yeah they have a lot less than the Indian ones don't they?
D	it's got garlic and ginger the same and it's got coriander and a tiny little bit of cumin but that's it
C	well it's good I like it you like your Asian food don't you?
A	mm
C	though your belly maybe not so much
A	no my belly's alright with it
C	yeah?
A	er
C	yeah
D	mm processed
C	that burger for me was a bit
D	processed foods
A	my stomach was alright when I was mostly travelling it was just erm that food poisoning we got
C	that
A	I
C	yeah you can't keep it in
A	yeah
C	too spicy
A	no it's wasn't like that but it was it was good
D	mm
A	healthy
C	less solid than normal?
A	no it was reasonable
C	talking about your motions at the dinner table
A	yeah nice subject
D	did you have lemongrass when you had to pick out or was it all kind of
C	you don't pick it out in general they they've already strained it
D	see the lemongrass that you cut up fine you'll be able to cook it and eat it
C	mm
D	if it's not cooked enough or cut down enough it can be a bit chaffy
A	tough
C	woody
D	so I tend to most times although it's a bit
C	sticks
D	the sticks are easy but if you're putting the leaves in the leaves even if I tie em in a knot to start with they untie
C	yeah and fall apart
D	and yeah
C	I steep mine
D	yeah
C	in hot water and then just add the water
D	yeah mm
C	I'm convinced it's the main ingredient in Lemsip
D	mm
C	cos it smells exactly the same as a lemon Lemsip
D	it is
C	lemon Lemsip doesn't smell like lemon it smells like lemongrass
A	mm yeah I suppose so did you put quite a lot of fish sauce in there?
D	erm two tablespoonfuls
C	yeah
A	yeah it's nice
D	mm
C	always adds that extra zing doesn't it? fish sauce
D	mm
C	you don't really wanna just eat it on its own
D	no
C	do you reckon how many tablespoons of fish sauce could you handle?
D	I don't know but I put two good sized tablespoonfuls in
D	the cinnamon?
C	yeah you have to eat a tablespoon of cinnamon
D	oh right do you want some more
A	yeah please it's good
D	do you want some more
C	a little bit
C	thank you
D	do you want some more sauce?
C	no that's ample
D	is that enough sauce?
D	do you want some more sauce?
C	no no I'm good dad thank you
D	that's it it's all done
C	if I eat too big a portion pretty much guarantees heartburn
D	is that too hot?
D	no?
C	you can eat a massive
D	what's it called? a cinnamon what?
C	cinnamon challenge
C	people eat a tablespoon of cinnamon it looks awful er
D	mm
C	like the worst thing ever
D	cinnamon's quite sweet isn't it?
C	yeah it's just the way that it completely coats your mouth and like
D	oh right
C	there's powder everywhere they can't breathe you just see them coughing it out and like it looks horrible
C	it looks absolutely horrible for about three or four minutes they're just coughing and spluttering and screaming and it looks
C	it looks like they've just put sawdust in their mouth
D	mm
C	can you imagine like drying your mouth out
D	mm
C	and not being able to breathe and not being able to get it out of your mouth
D	right
C	it looks like they just done that with sawdust
D	why do they do that?
C	it's just become a craze on Youtube
D	oh right
C	because people don't believe that it's as bad as that
D	mm
C	so they film themselves doing it but it looks terrible
D	I would also imagine that possibly someone who's asthmatic badly asthmatic it could probably finish em
C	no yeah it looks like you could die from it I think
A	yeah
C	could send yourself into a coughing fit and just not come back out
A	mm that wouldn't be good it doesn't look much fun to be honest
A	yeah
D	it's surprising what people will do when when you put a camera in front of them
C	for a bit of fame
D	mm
D	the thing with this it's not erm erm sort of get it so that it's it's a hot curry
C	yeah
D	if I was to dump a load of chilli in in here you wouldn't be able to tell erm what else was in it
C	mm
A	this is my kind of curry it's really tasty
D	mm
A	I like it
C	is that brown sauce?
B	I think it's just
C	last bit
D	did we get any more we said we were going to
B	we?
D	well actually you cos you said oh oh I've got enough when we were at erm Asda last week
B	yes erm you say we went shopping yes
C	what is brown sauce made of?
A	is it like ketchup
D	molasses is it molasses?
C	does it say on the back? it's interesting that they put no nuts and then the next phrase is cannot guarantee nut free
D	mm
C	straight after it says no nuts why bother telling us that there's no nuts?
D	mm
B	cos it's made in a laboratory where they use nuts
C	yeah
B	and it's for people that are hypersensitive
C	just skip the no nuts bit and just say
D	anaphylaxis
C	cannot
C	oh yeah I know
D	mm
C	it's got apple pulp in it
D	was there any molasses or not?
C	soy sauce no oh yeah yeah it's pretty high in molasses
D	I thought it would be
C	water's the biggest ingredient then tomato purée followed by glucose fructose syrup followed by molasses and modified maize starch so there's three different types of sugar in a row and acetic acid date paste dates in it
D	mm
C	interesting
A	are you not eating the mushroom
D	no I was advised him not to didn't taste very nice
A	no?
C	sorry you should've just put em in the curry
C	I could've picked em out
D	I know but I wouldn't like to put er eat something I didn't like that was infused in my meal would you?
A	mm
C	no I mean I just
C	I pick it out at the beginning and give it to you and then I'll dig in
D	I attempted to be a little clever I should've just fried them off and then you could've just added the meat to your curry you know
C	mm
D	but I didn't which was my bad
D	which was my bad it didn't work the
D	I shouldn't've put the tomato purée in
C	no harm in trying something new
D	another thing with with this one rather than Indian ones Indian ones I try to my Indian curries are much drier
C	yeah definitely
D	with er with Thais you gotta have the sauce er you can't have a dry well you can obviously there's I'm sure there's dry Thai curries but
C	it is unusual they're usually like soups
A	yeah
D	mm
C	soupier even than this
D	mm
C	to the point where it's a soup
A	yeah I got disappointed a few times where I thought I'd ordered a curry and I actually got a soup
D	yeah
C	everyone ready to play Battlestar?
D	indeed are you ready my dear?
C	what do you think
B	we'll see
A	I'm ready
B	we'll see you have an advantage on me
A	I think we're all pretty fresh apart from
D	mm
C	there shouldn't be an advantage in the game play maybe very very very slight
D	mm
C	it might just be quicker to pick up
C	we're actually all working as a team
D	yeah
C	so we're not really working against each other we're working to help each other
D	oh right
C	so it shouldn't matter that you're disadvantaged
D	well one of the four of us is going to be isn't it?
C	perhaps even two
A	we could all four be Cylons it could happen
C	the game ends immediately
D	I think you've been
A	there's a ship
A	and they're trying to destroy it
D	mm although there are quite a few ships
C	basically the the terminator is chasing has destroyed most of humanity's home and it's chasing them across the galaxy trying to kill them basically
B	so what's the idea of the game?
D	survival I'd imagine
C	yeah the idea of the game is to reach a certain distance in the ship you've got to get to earth
D	we haven't finished erm er I dunno where we are in er series three or series four I can't remember
C	yeah and have we finished Battlestar?
D	no
C	that's terrible
D	well other things came along that we er started to watch
C	nothing should come between you and Battlestar
D	The
C	oh certainly not for The Walking Dead it's a lot lot better than The Walking Dead
D	mm
A	I'm with you on that one that one's terrible
C	no
D	I don't mind it to be fair
C	the acting is poor the storyline's poor all the characters are extremely annoying I don't know if they do that just so I hope they die
D	mm
C	cos that works quite well kind of rooting for one of them to die
D	the zombies in World War Z were far more animated than they were in The Walking Dead
C	mm
D	cos
C	did you like the movie?
D	it was watchable it was a film it wasn't
C	wasn't great
D	it wasn't it wasn't bad it it wasn't great it wasn't bad
C	did you ever read the book?
D	no but er no but
C	no no I'm not buying you any more books
D	but no I meant to
A	was the book?
D	so I would've read it
C	it's only it's probably quite good for you cos it's just like short snippets of stories there's only like five to ten pages per story
D	yeah yeah mm
C	so you could just read five to ten pages
D	yeah
C	and you said that you're having trouble sleeping I keep saying try
D	no
C	before you go to bed like in bed read
D	no erm
C	really sends people to sleep anyone that reads in bed will tell you
D	mm
C	pretty much that after about ten or fifteen pages
D	yeah
C	it's really hard to keep your eyes open
D	er I'm not I'm not having trouble now but I I er was having trouble and so I I do things to enable me not to have the
A	yeah
D	trouble
C	try to read next time honestly
D	mm
C	I give you ten or fifteen pages
D	I've got to
C	you slowly get lower in the bed and lower in the
D	mm
C	I think it's just the action of your eyes moving across
D	mm
C	these tiny little letters late at night it gets really tiring
A	it works for me
C	yeah
B	he
C	it works for everyone I know
B	he doesn't enjoy a book though
C	no
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	some people don't like books	Entailment
B	not like me
D	I I'm knowledgeable which is strange because I don't read books
C	there's other avenues
D	I get my information from er reading articles or seeing it on TV or
C	mm
D	whatever but erm I should read more I'm not well read
C	it's kinda like a skill you kind of have to get better at it when
D	mm
C	if you don't read very often
B	the more you read the faster you read
[ANNOTATION]	reading more increases reading speed	Entailment
D	mm
B	and the more you get into them
D	well if it's er if it's something that's gripping I'll I'll tend to read more pages but erm
C	yeah thing is things have to get gripping
D	yeah
C	it's kinda like when you say would you start watching something you don't say it's naff immediately
D	no no
C	with a book it's the same you've got to give it a hundred pages and then
D	I know I know
C	and then it gets going
D	I know it's a it's a it's a a
[ANNOTATION]	reading on paper form is better	Neutral
C	just be something you
D	mm
C	do a bit later maybe just
D	mm
C	when you're a little bit older you'll get really into it
[ANNOTATION]	young people read faster	Neutral
D	mm
C	maybe when you're
D	they say everyone's got a book in them but I got to read a couple first before I
C	yeah
D	before I I can produce em
D	well that wasn't too bad
C	no it was good I finished it how was yours
[ANNOTATION]	no one finished reading	Contradiction
B	fish fingers taste funny
C	oh
D	do they?
B	mm
C	can we do you anything else?
D	do you want me to try one? er just to see if they're they're okay I mean
D	no not because I'm hungry I'm just saying to try a bit to see if it's alright or to think of yeah you're right
D	no it's okay no okay maybe not no I'm not hungry not at all
[ANNOTATION]	everyone is hungry	Contradiction
D	not hungry
D	cos fish is
C	bad
D	food poisoning with
C	can we make you anything else
B	no I'm fine thank you
C	you're okay?
B	mm
C	you really need
D	mm
A	I'm about ready to give up
D	mm
C	I've given up
A	lovely
D	okay well
C	yeah
D	and we'll give it a go
D	I'll see if there's anything I need to record for us this evening
B	Who Do You Think You Are?
D	I'll need to record that
D	mm
B	it's a
D	yeah it's a
C	the lineage
B	mm
D	there's been a
B	Brian Blessed last week it was good
D	yeah
B	this week it's erm Tamzin Outhwaite
D	Tamzin Outhwaite there's been some good ones you know interesting erm er lots of them they can only go back to possibly the great-grandparents but ones like Matthew Pinsent and that could trace his ancestry back to William the Conqueror which is pretty impressive
A	mm
C	mm
D	whereas it meant that
C	I don't think we trace our family back very far
D	if he hadn't er no but er at least to the Second
C	back to about your dad isn't it? and then it just ends
D	at least to the Second World War I will get round to it at some time
A	at least to the Second World War
D	yes exactly
D	but er
C	is your family easier to trace
B	er
C	yeah so you've gone all the way
B	and and
C	yeah
D	you can if you're er diligent and got the time you
C	after that
D	it's then erm er
C	mm
D	and er to see history and that I like to he's much maligned maligned by maligned by Shakespeare as well but but all due to Tudor propaganda is Richard the third
C	thank you
D	they found his body which was remarkable erm a one in a million chance of actually doing it they
A	thank you
D	Richard the the third was the last Plantagenet king and the last king to be killed
C	what's a Plantagenet king?
D	the Plantagenets were from France
C	oh okay
D	er everyone erm erm it's probably another good thing that erm if you're supposed to be educated the foreign language you speak is French
C	mm
D	because erm
B	can I have that bowl please are you throwing that?
D	yes all confiscated and passed over to the Normans the Normans were French so for the next three hundred years the nobility of this country speak French they don't speak English
C	mm
D	the English is
C	mm
D	erm and so there was the Hundred Years' War and erm yeah it's pretty interesting and like I said the last one erm I think Richard is the one you you must've read a little bit about him at school that you would know well we all you I think we took you as youngsters erm you probably wouldn't remember that but he is the king who allegedly put the two nephews in the tower
C	mm
D	and they were erm
C	mm
D	and had died but I think that erm he was er I don't know if he did it I think his wife probably did it erm rather than him but I could see his dilemma was that erm his older brother who'd become king didn't look anything like Richard Richard's got erm is quite short and and
C	I don't know how you remember all these kings and queens and all them
B	because we watch them
B	one after the other
D	and so although he knew that his
C	mm
D	erm hence the stature er er cos most of the archers were tall tall guys erm so when he accepted that his brother older brother was going to be king but when he died he thought to himself well I'm the I'm the actual genuine heir my brother's two children the mother is was the queen but the
C	mm
D	so either he or the royal machine got them out of the way and they were murdered they were only about nine and eleven
D	but
C	Lancaster? Lannister
D	they fused them they
C	mm
D	it the then the Tudor propaganda erm had to erm change everything to make it look like erm cos Henry the seventh won on the Battle of erm Bosworth which was where he defeated William his connection to the
C	mm
D	he she he had to marry er someone with a stronger connection to force you know to make it more of a bond
D	so the Tudor's did a propaganda on
A	yeah
D	in in Shakespeare's play
A	yeah
C	does this interest you as much as dad
D	no
B	I used to but not
D	there's certain parts of history that
D	that I'm interested in there's other parts of history that I'm not
C	not so interested in no you seem to like the er monarchs British monarchs
D	I like the monarchs I also like erm people like er Temüjin who became Genghis Khan
C	mm
B	yeah
C	conquerors and monarchs
D	I like
C	revolutionaries conquerors and
D	yeah so er all of the all of the
C	all the better for is there anything we can do?
B	no
D	yes set up your game
C	game's already set up we're just waiting for you to go
D	right er
D	let us do er the heavy lifting
B	is this anybody's
C	ah I think I may have just put water down
B	yeah right that's alright
C	I'll take it next door shall I? you alright
A	yeah I'm good ready to play
C	yeah I think they might be a little while maybe if we go and help them it'll be quicker
A	feel free
C	it's always your motto isn't it?
A	mm
A	you could pause it?
C	yeah I suppose I could do but I need silence
A	but you could take it with you and go pee
C	it won't be very pleasurable will it?
C	to whoever's listening
C	yeah they kind of told me that it can't just be monologue so
A	no?
C	no so that's why I kind of need to get dad off his monologues really
D	set up the TV
A	yeah
D	you look you look at erm like what er
C	look at this
D	it's quite complex er
D	erm
C	clickers remotes
D	and my glasses erm
C	oh we've got the same hard drive
C	is that a terabyte?
D	yes when
C	how much did that cost you?
D	erm I can't remember to be fair
C	mine was about fifty quid
D	and
D	erm no I never broke it it just broke
C	what? My Passport?
A	not er My Passport but it's it's another WD one
D	not broke no it wasn't a
C	it broke nobody broke it
D	it was a Westgate I think is it Westgate? Westgate? West?
A	WD
D	Western Digital or something?
C	yeah
A	Western Digital
D	erm
C	are you guys gonna be in here for a few minutes and
D	well
C	if I go to the toilet and just leave this?
A	yeah sure
D	yeah
C	yeah? cool
D	I was just saying erm
C	I'll go to the toilet
D	okay
C	it's still going
D	alright
A	have you had a look at this game? it's monumental it's crazy
D	is it gonna be a tough tune to er pick up?
A	maybe but I think
D	right so he can give us the idiot's erm guide to it
A	mm
D	right
A	there's probably gonna be too much to pick up in one go so as we play we might need him to explain
D	yeah that complex hey?
A	mm cos the board is
A	there's a lot going on
C	right is there anything else you don't understand on this?
A	erm I don't understand anything that's on that table there
C	nothing?
A	we'll see like I don't know how we start and what's the first thing we do and everything like that
C	cool first thing we've gotta do is choose a character
A	well I guessed that but after that
C	erm
A	yeah and then we get the card and we find out whether we're a Cylon or not
C	yeah
A	and then after that?
C	after that we collect our erm skills cards
A	how do you know what ones you get?
C	it says it on your card here he's gonna have two yellow two green and one purple
A	okay
C	so you collect that every round
A	do we use them all at once?
C	no you bet with them so on the cards it will have two things it will have a number in the corner and one to five five would be a strong betting card one would be a low but it also has an action so you can either use this card to bet with or you can do the action on the card some of the actions allow you to give other people actions the actions are quite different the cards repeat a lot though
A	er so the
C	so like this one
A	so this card is er is one?
C	yeah its betting power is only one
A	so that's low?
C	yeah it's out of five
A	so who do you bet with? the other players?
C	yeah you work as a team to reach your goal of jumping to Kobol
A	so what would be the purpose of betting this against someone? I don't understand
C	so there's gonna be a card here and the card is gonna have a crisis like this
A	yeah
C	and the crisis says if you pass then such and such if you fail such and such and then it's got a number thirteen
A	so
C	so collectively we need to get the power of thirteen and it's only with these two colours yellow and green
A	yeah so we can either I can either give this up or I can use its action
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	basically
A	that's cool
C	yeah
A	makes sense
C	er so it has two functions
A	yeah oh shit
C	that's the yellow one fairly complicated
A	yeah I know
C	hopefully won't cause any arguments
A	well we're playing together so er
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	somebody's gonna be either on their own oh that's what I was telling you earlier so when you get halfway to eight when you get to four we get dished out another card another loyalty card to see who's a Cylon now if none of these wheels are in the red so if they're all the blue then there'll be a second Cylon but if er any one of these wheels is in the red by the time we get to four then that there won't be another Cylon they'll become a sympathiser and they'll get sent to the Brig but they're not a Cylon they're a Cylon effectively but they sympathise with the humans
A	is that your rule or the game's rule?
C	it's the game's rule
A	right
C	the only rule I've added is every time we jump a basestar goes at the front because sometimes you jump and the board clears and you can pull like five or six cards and no Cylons come on the thing and it can get a bit slow so every time we jump I put a basestar so that means there's always a threat there's always a
A	this is how you play with your friends?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	there's always a threat it seemed better that way we've only played that way like twice but it er seemed better so I suggest we do it
A	how long er do these games take with your mates?
C	three to four hours usually
A	you never said three to four
A	you said three
C	yeah well I don't think we're gonna finish it especially not at this rate
A	mm
C	do you know which character you're gonna be?
A	no cos if I'm not first pick there's no point in making the choice
C	well you can be first pick
A	can do
C	choose a character do you wanna be a military leader? a pilot? which way are you leaning?
A	I think Gaius would be an unwise choice for my first time
C	I was Gaius on my first time
A	you probably wanna be Gaius
A	yeah he's cool
C	I was tempted to grow my hair like that just kinda get it down to here
A	that's crazy
A	er it's just a lot of hair
A	yeah
C	you know that
D	sorry?
C	cool these are damage tokens you know that this is a bit pointless this one it's just a token that you have when it's your turn
A	yeah
C	don't really see the point in that it's pretty easy to remember whose turn it is
A	is it?
A	dunno should probably read through their actual abilities too
A	rather than just look at pictures
C	that might take a while
A	what do you think a good choice is?
C	I don't know maybe like I think as a pilot Apollo's good he can jump into a ship whenever anyone launches a ship he can
A	I'm looking at Apollo at the moment
C	who's the other guy?
A	Tom Zarek
C	what's his negative?
A	he's a criminal
A	just says military leader
C	yeah but he can play pilot skill cards
A	I might pick Apollo then
C	you're gonna go for Apollo
C	go for it
A	that'll be my pick then
C	yeah right
A	sweet
C	what was that? you have new unwanted message oh god
C	erm I don't wanna go and see them separately I don't wanna have to go all the way out to
A	mm
C	can't they just
D	right
C	you nearly ready?
C	yeah
B	yeah won't be a sec
C	excellent
B	mm
D	gonna wear my glasses I think
C	okay time to play this may take a little while
D	ah right yes
C	hopefully it won't be too bad so we don't have to finish the game
D	no okay oh it's your toe? yeah
D	yeah
C	so first thing's first we need to choose a character
A	I've already chosen mine
D	er
C	Apollo yeah
D	who's left? Adama?
C	so there are pilots
D	yeah
C	there's one guy on his own he's a support the Chief
D	the Chief right
C	there's three military leaders and there's three political leaders now
D	no
C	so you need to choose one of the most you can either choose support
D	I'll go for being er Adama
C	okay right dad's Adama take that one
D	right that's me
C	right
B	okay
C	yeah?
B	yeah
C	so kind of chose for you but
D	right
C	no don't worry I'll be Chief then I'll go for support
C	so we've chosen our characters
D	right
C	have you got two have you?
D	no they're the
C	that you didn't want cool
D	you've taken my card back
C	why?
C	if you look at your card everyone should have kinda like a positive thing that you can do every turn then underneath it there's something you can do once in the whole game and then at the bottom is like a negative thing
D	erm
C	do you see?
A	do you see?
B	typical
C	what? oh yeah
B	just typical
C	sorry I didn't think about that at all
C	she's very sick isn't she?
A	oh
C	sorry
C	she has a very good positive though she can look at two cards at once
C	sorry
C	do you wanna change characters?
B	I'll just
C	typecasting
A	that's terrible
C	I'm really sorry she's a strong character
D	I'm emotionally attached
A	oh dear
C	okay so the idea of the game is we're all working together potentially
D	okay
C	to jump to Kobol we wanna find Kobol
D	oh yeah that's supposed to be earth isn't it?
D	right
A	this one has two so that'd be four total so we've jumped twice but we're at a power of four we jump three times we're at a power of six just so happens they're all two
D	so what happens when you hit eight?
A	we win the game
D	oh right
C	so we've gotta jump to er to
D	right
C	so it's a little bit complicated so I'll just explain it as we go along okay?
A	sounds good
D	yeah
C	so whose character's whose?
D	who am I again?
B	I'm Laura
C	you're Laura Roslin? okay Laura Roslin here you go
B	thank you
C	you're also the president so you get a president card
D	er
C	yes she was also a teacher yeah dad who are you?
D	I'm Adama
C	you're Adama
D	but with better skin
A	okay
D	did you buy this is Korea?
C	yeah a friend bought it for us there you are
D	right
C	and my one I'm Chief okay
D	what's that you picked up?
B	this is the president card
D	oh right
C	it should say that you
D	I
C	start with some quorum cards or something does it say?
D	that's er I'm
B	draw a quorum card into your hand
C	er right at the beginning?
B	at the start of the game draw one quorum card
C	okay that's your quorum card so you as the president you get special ability that you can always draw from these cards er
B	er er can I look at it?
C	yeah you're the only person that can use these cards okay?
B	okay
C	unless we take the president title from her which we can do cos she might be a Cylon
D	yes
C	so we don't want a Cylon as the president or as the admiral
D	not
C	so you have to be careful dad you're the admiral so you get the admiral's card and you also get two nuke tokens
D	oh right that's always come in
C	you can nuke the basestars
D	they always come in handy don't they?
C	yeah
D	where am I gonna keep all this stuff?
C	be careful of what you keep on the board
D	yeah
C	cos this is part of the game so
D	yes I'm going to put this down here
C	okay now have a look at where you place it should say setup on the bottom of your wrong
D	hold on let me just read this
C	yeah wrong card
B	er president's office
C	president's office so you take the token and put it up in the president's office here okay?
B	okay
C	so you're on a different ship we're on the main ship here
A	it
C	okay so you need that one not that one and you pilot a viper do you wanna launch on this side or on this side?
A	erm that side's fine
C	this side's good so
D	okay
C	we have to move on the board
A	how far can I move in go? is it one of these?
C	yeah sometimes two depending on your move
A	yeah
C	er I'm in the hangar deck I fix things I'm the Chief
D	okay I'm er I I'm on the bridge I don't know
C	where where are you?
D	erm erm er er
A	admiral's quarters
D	admiral's quarters
C	admiral's quarters so where's your little person dad?
D	is that the front of the ship?
C	admiral's quarters is here
D	okay
C	okay? so in your turn at the beginning of the round you're gonna pick up these cards that are listed here I can have one yellow which is politics here
D	mm
C	two green which is leadership
D	mm
C	and two engineering here so everyone's got different cards
D	yeah that's right yeah
C	and at the beginning of your round you've gotta pick up that many cards that's in your hand
D	okay
C	and your go has a
B	uhu mm
C	I'll tell you about that later you have three stages first stage move second stage is do an action this is where it gets a little bit complicated the action can be either written on the board
D	oh it's not charades
C	no no
D	I was gonna say where's that
C	it says something on here
D	yes
C	so the action can either be something on the board it can be something written on one of these cards or it can be your action that's on your thing here
D	okay
C	so you choose and
A	okay
C	oh that things beeping again
D	yes I'm just gonna go and deactivate it
A	shall we start er dishing out our cards
C	yeah so I guess you go first I need to do the loyalty cards first
A	this is where we find out who's a Cylon well if you're a Cylon
D	I er
C	yeah there is
D	oh I didn't see that Baltar I'd've gone for Baltar
C	do you wanna change?
B	no
D	no
D	I'll stick with the admiral
C	okay right we're gonna get a card now one card just choose one don't look at it just choose it this is whether or not you're a Cylon don't look at it
D	okay
C	got that one? yeah? nobody look at their card the reason I'm saying that I'm gonna choose that one add the sympathiser in the reason I say that is because we found out if you are not a Cylon it doesn't say anything on your card so you quickly look at your card and put it down but if you are a Cylon it says something on your card
D	so you study it longer
C	so you study it so you know who's a Cylon so
D	yes
C	we all need to look at our card at the same time for five seconds
D	okay right
C	so you can't tell who's a Cylon or not
D	yes
C	are you ready?
D	okay
C	so read your card one two three four five okay? so hide your card that stays with you throughout the whole game
D	mm
C	okay? right
A	sure
C	so what are your colours here?
A	right I need er er one purple
C	yeah
A	and two red
C	mm
A	and then I can either er pick two leadership or politics or are they the same thing?
C	one or one or two and two
A	let's have one of each
C	one leadership one politics actually I made a
A	which other two?
C	yeah
A	in addition to these?
C	yeah or even from the same colours
A	oh okay can I get
C	yeah
A	purple one more red
C	okay there you go so
B	erm I'll have one more leadership
C	okay
B	and one more politics please
C	okay there you are
D	I need to get my cards cos I don't have any
C	yeah but when it comes to your go you will
D	okay
C	yeah so which colours would you like?
D	erm I need three erm leadership two tactic
C	but we only get two at the first round so just choose the colours and tell me which
D	alright I'll have one of each one green one purple
C	one green one purple there you go
D	am I allowed to look at these?
C	yeah course you are we use these to bet so if you look at the card it has a strength at the top
C	like a number between one and five and we use them to bet that's their strength but you can also use them in
D	is one good or or five good?
C	five's good one's bad so three would be medium
D	mm okay
C	we use them to bet you'll see when it comes round and it's also got an action on it so you can either chose to use the card for its action or you can bet with it and like do it
D	okay
C	as it goes along right
A	er right I have to move do I?
C	you don't have to move
A	okay I'm not gonna move at the moment
C	okay and you can do an action
A	or
C	you have to do an action
A	okay so if I wanna do an action I should probably move to somewhere useful
C	yeah so these ships here can be destroyed we don't want them to be destroyed we wanna protect them so you probably wanna go into that area so that should any ships come over these are actually meant to be over here they will they'll attack you before they attack these
A	yeah okay that makes sense
C	so you move there?
A	yeah
C	cool now you get an action
A	well I take it I've only got one action then?
C	once per game
A	yeah it says once per game
C	yeah
A	or
C	yeah
A	yeah okay
C	or if you're in the ship you'd have more actions
A	alright okay that's interesting I might do a tactic one
C	what does it say?
A	I've got one called Launch Scout
C	what does it do?
A	which is risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher look at the top card of the crisis or destination dig and place it on the top or the bottom
C	okay so this is the crisis card do you wanna do that? we only have four raptors in the whole game but you can risk them
A	I'll risk one
C	yeah okay so get rid of that card
A	well let's keep it here just so I know what happens
C	okay do you wanna roll the die?
A	where is it? here?
C	yeah
A	so I need above a three six
C	and what happens?
A	right look at the top of the crisis or destination deck right what would be a better pick?
C	this is the crisis deck this is the destination deck probably the crisis deck
A	okay er so look right so I just get to see what's the next crisis is gonna be?
C	you get to look how many do you get to look at? what did it say?
A	er just just says doesn't say so I assume one
C	so
A	yeah so it's mandatory testing
C	you can't tell us
A	oh
C	this is just private for you
A	just me
C	mm
C	you could be a Cylon you might want that against us or for us you don't know
D	that yeah
C	you can put it down and say it's good this is okay or it's bad or you can put I think you can put put it to the bottom of the deck it's your choice
A	okay
C	what do you reckon
B	no
C	no?
B	not at all I haven't a clue
D	it it's quite a tough tune isn't it?
D	even I erm
C	erm it's gonna take you about an hour to get to grips I think we need to go round like twice before we'll understand it I think
D	unfortunately there's no dummy run is there?
C	yeah this is the dummy run nothing's gonna happen too much at the minute don't worry
D	no
C	if you don't want to we can stop
D	no no
B	no go on I'll have a go yeah but I'm just
D	we'll give it a go
B	at the minute yeah
C	yeah fine
B	I don't see what we're trying to do er to achieve
D	we're trying to get to Kobol
C	yeah
D	I do know that much
B	yeah but where's Kobol
D	earth
B	yeah
C	we have to jump
D	jump
C	here so once we get up here
C	we jump and we go back to the start so we basically have to make this thing go up to the top and back down four times
B	right
C	and er
D	and eight
C	and we pull cards here that tells us where we go
D	eight
C	now we lose if any of these the fuel the food the morale the population if any of these go down to zero we lose so certain cards we pull are gonna say minus two of this or minus one of this
B	right
C	or something like that we have to bet to stop that from happening the Cylons can attack you as well and these little things here these are like destruction on the ship so you can't use this area if it's got one on it
D	no
C	so they're they're trying to attack you as well these things here are little population ships if you turn these for example it's got the sign of population people and the sign of morale so if this got destroyed by this or one of these then we'd lose one of each on this one so it's all about losing these basically
D	mm
C	everything is trying to kill your population kill your morale kill your food and kill your your fuel
A	yeah and er whoever's the Cylon they'll want bad things to happen to the rest of the team
C	yeah
A	but not to not get found out
C	they don't wanna be obvious yeah
A	yeah
D	no
C	so you wanna keep it a secret so like now
A	oh so I got to see what I was about to?
C	yeah you can either put it back at the bottom and choose another one or or use that one
A	oh okay erm
C	you're gonna do that one now you can show us so now you put it down on the table
A	yeah okay
C	what is it? so there's two symbols on the card usually this little sun means jump so now we've drawn this card this goes up one okay? so we're trying to get up on this thing we've gone up one because there's that sign this sign looks like these little ships here and we don't have any on the board so because we have a basestar and we saw this sign the basestar launches one okay?
D	okay
C	and that goes on to the board
D	right
C	they're trying to board
D	mm
C	right if we pass it the president that's you looks at one random loyalty card of anyone
D	when you
C	okay so at the top of each thing there's a number thirteen
D	right
C	and there's the colours that you can use these have different colours
D	right
C	so we all have to bid together using these cards we all have to bid and put them in in a pile and if we get above thirteen cumulatively we win and we pass if we get below if we fail it then we lose one morale and if we get above nine but we don't fail it nothing happens on this one
D	okay
C	so we've gotta vote for this so you've gotta have a look at your cards
D	cos er I've only got two cards I didn't have
C	yeah
D	right okay
B	so have I
D	no cos it's not my game
C	at the minute we only do we don't have many cards
D	yeah well I'm struggling
D	so I'm kind of off on off on
C	it's not working
D	I need bifocals
C	you need one just a monocle on one eye
D	yes
A	so we're kinda screwed
D	mm
A	because like we don't have many cards on play
C	no and that was quite a high one to pick if I and it was damaging us if I were you I'd've put that to the bottom
A	well I didn't know
C	no
D	you do now
A	yeah oh no
C	it's happened
A	well
C	we can lose it and we just minus one morale that's all
A	er can we
C	so now everyone looks at their cards and says how much you can help in this bid you can't be explicit but you can say I can help a bit or I can help a lot and you could be lying
C	you could put in a negative card something that goes against it
A	can we only give one card each?
C	no you can give as many cards as you want
A	right so if I had thirteen then I could put them all down
C	yes however there is a destiny deck so there will always be two random cards in it you don't know what those cards are so we need to try and be a bit higher than thirteen cos these could be two negative cards
B	so we're all we're doing is looking to the at the numbers on the corner of the cards?
D	the the the
C	yeah just the numbers on the corner
D	right
B	it doesn't matter what they say they just
C	no
D	so it doesn't matter if it's?
C	provided it's the right colours which on this one is yellow and green so it's quite restricted it doesn't do three of the colours
D	oh
C	yeah
D	right
C	if you haven't got that colour the
D	or it's
C	or or if you're a Cylon you could put a card of a different colour down
D	right
C	and you want them to lose so you're doing that but you have to be careful because if you put too many they'll know that somebody is sabotaging the bet
D	are they negative?
C	they're negative against it yeah
D	right so if it was say
C	so I've pulled two random cards now they could
D	so okay
C	let's play this one out so we see what's happening here we
D	yeah that's why we er have a complete dumminy dummy run
C	so actually this is good for us
D	yeah
C	I pulled two random cards and they're both in favour and one is a five and one is a three so we're already at power eight
D	that's eight yes
C	so
D	okay I can help that with a four
C	yeah cool so you in the game you can't be explicit you can't say you can just say I can help a lot or I can pull my weight
D	oh oh okay so do I show that card or just
D	yeah
C	we would put it face down
D	right
C	and then it gets shuffled
D	okay
C	and then
D	let's do it I can help quite a lot
C	okay good
D	er but it's actually four just for the
C	yeah
D	this dummy run
C	cool so we'll play this one out
D	and it's green
C	cos it's a dummy run
B	right okay well I can help a fair bit
C	good nice yeah I can only a little bit unfortunately
A	I don't need to help
C	you don't need to you don't need to put anything down no
D	no
C	cool so we won
D	so everything stays the same
C	so we won that bet yeah so we didn't get the fail we didn't get the
D	what's our
C	which doesn't normally happen so early on in the game
D	what's our loyalty card is this one that we picked?
C	the one that says whether you're a Cylon or not
D	oh that one? she can have a look at that?
C	she can have a look at one person's
D	okay who she may suspect
C	yeah
D	okay
C	that doesn't normally come so quick in the game cos
D	no
C	you want that a bit later
D	those cards that have just been put down where do?
C	yeah
C	back here we make piles of the used cards and then we reshuffle them back in
A	so does she have to use that card now or can she keep it?
A	oh right
C	so show your loyalty card to
B	okay right
C	so you can give him back the card
B	okay
C	and now you know and it's your choice maybe you're a Cylon and you don't wanna tell us that he is or he isn't but
B	no I'm not gonna say anything
C	no? okay so Cylon blatantly
D	mm
C	er okay dad your go
D	right erm
C	so you're here
D	yep
C	you can move anywhere on the ship
D	right I'm only limited to this ship? I can't get
C	you can move to this ship but you have to discard one of these cards that's in your hand as like a tax to do that
D	yeah yeah okay I'll I'll stay on my own ship
C	cool
D	so if I stay on my ship do I just throw the dice now or?
C	well you can move to a different place you can choose anywhere you wanna move so do you wanna attack this basestar? cos I mean it's quite dangerous having a big old basestar there
D	yeah okay yeah
C	yeah so you go to the weapons control
C	and it says action so now you do your action attack one Cylon ship with Galactica
D	right
C	so you now roll a die good roll
D	five
C	so you attack the Cylon ship with Galactica you damaged it
D	right okay
C	so now you turn one of these at random do you want one two three or four?
D	let's go for three
C	three so you got two it takes three hits to destroy it
D	yeah
C	and that one hit counted as two hits
D	yeah so it needs only one more hit
C	so it only needs one more hit to destroy it
D	to to to knock that out
C	yeah
C	good okay so now you draw your crisis card
D	and only look at it myself?
C	you can show it to everyone now
D	is this the? oh but would I normally do that or not?
C	yeah you have to we have to all play the crisis
D	right so I have to take my glasses off
A	to read it
D	erm surrounded
C	oh oh
D	instructions activate set up basestar one heavy raider seven raiders two raiders
C	okay
D	are
C	we're getting attacked yeah
A	oh man we haven't had a good start
C	no
D	no
C	so the first thing that happens is we activate the basestar this basestar attacks Galactica
D	okay
C	so dad you need to roll the die again to see how damaged we are
D	er er one bad or six bad
C	so here now the basestar's being attacked
C	if it's with a basestar it's four to eight to damage us so you need lower than a four
D	I need a one then
C	yeah one two or three you got a one
A	yes
C	so we're okay
D	yes
C	now you don't know this yet but on some of your cards it says things like you can add two to the die roll or minus two from the die roll so at this point if dad
D	yes
C	didn't get the roll that he needed
D	I could've pulled that
C	we could go I've got a card and that helps
D	yeah
C	so you have to be careful to read some of them if it doesn't say action you can play it at any point
D	mm
C	there's some that don't say action so good so we saved the basestar that's good but we're also surrounded so now all these new things come on the board so we get another basestar here
D	like we needed one of those
C	we get four raiders
D	oh so that was quite a bad card to pick up wasn't it?
C	yeah yeah it was a terrible card to pick up but by the way once we jump all this goes and we start again
D	yes yeah I that
C	it clears the board
D	I er I understand that cos you're you're moving to a different erm
C	location in in space
D	location in space yeah
C	we get another one of these negative ships that we don't wanna have destroyed we get another one here we get two more of these things these are our ships these ones
D	they're vipers aren't they
C	yeah so you can go to a certain location like here and you can move them
D	right
C	you can move the ships to defend yourself
D	right
C	er okay oh there's four more bloody hell this is terrible
D	your mother wouldn't
B	pardon?
D	your mum wouldn't like this game
D	she'd be going is it Yahtzee? no
C	erm and panic there's a special rule at the bottom you have to discard three skill cards
D	er
C	did you even pick up your skill cards?
B	no
D	no I never got to round to picking up my
C	so what skill cards do you need?
D	well I was I I was I was gonna say at the time I'd have got three greens and two two but I never got to pick em up cos you said it wasn't my turn or something
D	two erm purples
C	two purples
C	so there you go but now you have to discard three because you got a negative effect
D	yes
C	yeah so look for a higher number
D	yeah er yes I know I've gotta discard three?
A	so get rid of the one
D	and the one
A	and the one
D	and
D	no they're all three now they're all
D	I'm gonna go for er erm taking er another
C	okay
D	so I put these three
C	yeah so you give them to me
D	to you
C	and these go back in the discard piles right and now you draw oh you did your crisis card
D	yeah
C	so now it's
B	okay okay I need to have on there erm three yellow and two green cards please
C	three yellow and two green see it's negative for you cos you can only get two colours and I think maybe you can as well
B	I only get two colours as well
C	so there are
B	if
C	there are other things here like this this area can allow you to pick up a card from any other colour
D	oh right
C	so you can move to the area and grab skills cards when you need them
D	right
C	actually we're a bit screwed has nobody got red?
D	no
A	I've got red
C	only
D	okay
C	which er
D	so if he was a Cylon we could be really in quite a lot of trouble already
C	yeah
D	mm
C	there there's that random piloting things
C	no
B	yeah right
C	so now you can move to a location
C	so you're you're already on this ship
B	alright so do I do?
C	so to move to this ship you have to
B	yeah
C	discard one of these
A	what's the action for the ship she's on now?
C	so
B	mm
C	and then you can draw another one of these cards or play one of the cards that's in your hand so you draw one
B	yeah
C	and you can either play one of the cards or draw another one
B	right I'll have the card then please
C	you'll do that?
B	yeah
C	so that's your action yeah?
B	yeah
C	so you're gonna draw one
B	right
C	look at it
B	and
C	and if there's a good action on one of these quorum cards you've got you can do that action now or you can draw another quorum card and save it for later
D	mm
C	and there's like a line of succession of who it goes to
D	mm
A	right who votes to send the president to the Brig?
B	watch it you
C	you might wanna use your erm nuke next time round
D	you know who'd probably like this game don't you?
D	and? a close relative of yours
B	yeah
C	ignoring the sci-fi though it's just a concept I dunno what the concept is really
D	yeah
C	I've never played a game like it
B	I need a card please
C	yeah okay here's your other quorum card
C	yeah when it comes to your go
D	I've got some nukes have I?
C	so you've done your action
B	okay
C	but you're the president so you get two crisis cards every time and you get to choose one so you see which one is if you're a Cylon which one's worse for us or if if you're a human then which one's better for us effectively
B	so what do I? what have I got to do now? do I keep these?
A	no you pick one
C	no you choose one for us to do as a group
D	the the best or the worst
C	yeah so if you're a human pick one that's easy for us that doesn't damage us that much basically these cards are always er trying to damage you that's all they're trying to do
D	yeah
C	is like damage your food
B	oh
C	damage your food you have to keep putting skills in to stop that from happening
D	mm
C	maybe at this point in the game you don't know which is stronger or which is weaker so it's no problem just choose one
B	well I can't
D	er
C	shall I have a quick look?
D	which would save
B	well we've got no one to to
C	no
B	so I can't do that
C	ah but this one like the distress don't when you read the card this is pointless it's just a quote and it's
D	yeah
C	it's a bit distracting all you really gotta read is this bit at the bottom
B	right
C	so this one here the raiders if you see a sign that looks like these ships
B	yeah
C	that means that these get activated and they move
B	right
C	if you see this sign that means that we go up one on the jump we want that
B	right yeah
C	but we don't want that
B	erm so
C	basically
B	right so
D	so if you were a Cylon you'd go for that one rather than that one
B	you don't choose they both happen
D	oh they both happen?
C	some of them you can see only there's only one
D	oh right okay
C	this one doesn't have the jump
D	right
C	so
B	so we'll go with the jump cos that's good isn't it?
C	yeah so jumping is good and this one is
B	yeah
C	just saying admiral chooses so basically you're the admiral so she's gonna give you this card and say you choose what do we do?
B	okay
D	oh I've got er I've got er the only choice I've got is to move er
C	do you want me to read it out?
D	er yes
C	okay admiral chooses do you wanna read it out
D	oh the
B	oh you're not recording this?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it's perfect perfect
A	right here we go admiral chooses minus one to morale and the current player is sent to sickbay
C	so that'd be
A	or minus one fuel and destroy one raptor
C	okay so either minus one morale and
D	mm
C	or minus one fuel and destroy a raptor
D	no I'll put her in sickbay
C	are you sure you wanna do that?
D	er
C	you lose resources both ways you
D	okay let's go for the lesser of two evils er
C	if
D	okay so perhaps it's better to destroy a raptor
C	and a fuel
D	and a fuel
C	cool raptor
D	erm
A	yeah one fuel
C	cool and one raptor
D	yeah one fuel and one and one raptor
A	yeah there's also a jump and er a
C	right so we go up one here and also the Cylons attack so basically when we saw that these activate these things go clockwise around the board these things
D	oh that's just another thing to remember
C	yeah they go this way round the board
D	yeah
C	and they're trying to destroy our ships
D	yes
C	or these things okay?
D	yes
C	these things go either way round the board depending on which way is closer to this bit
D	right
C	so this one is clearly closer this way so it's just
D	yes
C	gonna go this way
D	right
C	and try
A	oh no
C	these lot move up one
B	mm
C	and these lot move up one okay?
D	right
C	so next time if they activate they're gonna try attacking
D	right
A	what happens if I get attacked while I'm in that ship?
C	you can be destroyed and you go to the sickbay
A	oh right
D	right
C	but you can defend yourself also and we can give cards to help you
A	okay well
C	no
D	so every time we go round we pick up our skills cards?
C	quotas yeah
D	our quotas
C	you can only have ten in your hand at any one
D	yeah
C	that's okay until your go finishes and then you've gotta discard down to ten
D	mm oh I've got
C	actually I have erm my negative is that I can only have eight in my hand
D	oh right
C	not ten
D	I've only got three at the moment
C	yeah that's fine yeah we've been betting okay so bloody hell we need to attack something because
D	we're not looking we're not in good shape
C	we're being attacked quite badly er okay I'm gonna attack basestar with Galactica five
C	er it's damaged so it's turn one
D	so another turn
C	yes
D	needs three of those doesn't it'?
C	this yeah so that's damaged that's destroyed this er
D	is it destroyed?
C	this basestar's gone it already had two and I gave it another one
D	right and it's three to destroy it yeah so that's that's
D	okay
C	now that's difficult
D	yes
C	so that doesn't make it easy pass we get one food we plus a food
D	right
C	so that doesn't happen very often fail minus one fuel and destroy one raptor
D	mm
C	so kind of the same as last time fuel and a raptor
D	yeah
C	or we just choose to lose one food we don't have to do the betting we can just take minus one food
A	shall we take the food loss? I don't think we'll have an enough
C	well do we think how good are people for purple and red?
A	not too good
D	er
D	erm not bad
B	no
D	not bad but what's
A	I think
D	what's the score we're looking for?
C	nine
D	not bad
A	I think we should take the food
B	I don't have any
A	I think we should lose the food
C	you think we should lose it?
A	mm
C	you can't help very much I can't help at all
B	I can't
D	er I can help but not enough
C	not enough so we just have to take the or on this scenario so the or is minus one food so we lost the food so also on this one it had those symbols again activate the raiders and also jump so we jump we go up one and now the raiders attack so the first thing they attack is
D	right
C	so you've gotta roll the die
A	yeah
C	and hang on a minute if they get you lower that a five you're okay
C	so you need one to four and they're gonna attack you three times there's three of them
A	so I have to roll three times?
C	yeah
A	oh no this is gonna get me destroyed
C	so one you're good
C	two more times
A	oh
D	oh
C	eight oh that's destroyed as well that's not even damaged that's just destroyed
A	so what's destroyed?
C	does anyone have a card it's usually a purple one that can lower the die roll by two? I think it's purple
D	erm
C	it might be red
C	I don't I don't have any no?
D	no no
C	there's one that says lower the die roll by two
C	cool right
A	what's this
C	that's on the
A	oh okay
C	that's like the total you can reduce it by two so
A	oh
C	that thing goes this has been destroyed so this can never come back in the game again we lost that one
D	right okay
C	cos you get an eight normally they get damaged and you can repair them
A	mm
C	no so his character now he's in the sickbay
A	for how long?
C	until the next round you just take one card and come out
A	oh I see
C	erm and also one of these got through so it destroys one of these so choose one of these at random
A	erm right I'll this one
C	okay and turn it what does it say?
A	population
C	one population so we minus one population so that's gone from the game for good and also these all move round
D	oh good lord they're all in that box
A	they're coming
C	so yeah
D	we need to jump
C	so
A	we're gonna get destroyed
D	so
B	what's that? is that a good or a bad one?
C	that's a bad that's a terribly bad one
D	that's a bad one
B	oh right
D	yeah
C	these ones are worse than these
C	these ones try and get in and once it gets in it puts a Cylon token Cylons have boarded and then if that token gets up to here you lose
D	mm
C	so you don't want that to happen
D	right my go?
C	actually no it was my go wasn't it?
A	yeah
C	I'm still having my go and I didn't do a crisis card
D	oh right oh right okay
C	I don't think did I do a crisis card? I did do a crisis card
A	yeah that was why
C	that's why everything happened so now it's
A	okay so I need to
C	you're in sickbay
C	you can only get one skill card
A	I'm gonna take erm a red
C	okay good idea
D	yeah that might be a good idea
C	oh oh god sorry it was stuck to my drink
A	didn't even notice
B	put it on the erm marble hearth behind you it won't do any harm on there
C	mm
A	I've got good cards
C	okay
A	maximum firepower
C	so
D	what does he
C	you can move now
D	right so he takes one
C	he can still move he can move out of sickbay only the Brig you can't in the Brig you have to vote
D	mm mm
C	until you get people out
A	right so can I move out and make an action?
C	yeah I recommend can I give you a recommendation?
A	so can I can I get in a viper and get here?
C	yes you can you can get to the hangar deck and shoot yourself in a viper but you'll only get
A	oh no
C	my recommendation to you would be to move these
D	yeah get em out of harm's way
A	can we move em both?
C	yeah there's a thing here that says look at the back of two civilian ships these are civilian ships you may then move them to an adjacent area
A	okay
C	so you can have a look at these see how bad they are and then move them around so they get away from these guys
D	do we all see that or just
C	just
A	I dunno why oh we don't wanna move that
C	okay so and then move them round so they're out of harm's way
B	do they have to be moved together?
C	yes yeah well no you could move them in two separate directions
B	oh right I was gonna say yeah
D	don't wanna send em in there though
C	but no yeah you don't wanna send em that way
D	no
C	so yeah you've saved those
D	right
C	and er now it's your crisis card
B	okay
D	okay
C	is it starting to make more sense?
C	no?
D	yeah
B	do you know what you're doing?
D	er it's making more sense I don't know totally what I'm doing but
B	how many
C	well we're at seven if we get down to zero we we're bad
D	we're
C	population we have the most of but every time we jump these cards pretty much always minus population
D	mm
C	so you kinda like lose ships as you
B	can we have a choice? can I tell you would it?
C	yeah you can tell us the choice
B	er it you've got we've either got to do minus one food or I've got to lose two of my skill cards and
C	and that's all that happens? we don't lose any food or anything?
B	yeah the choice
C	do you have the skill cards to get rid of?
A	yeah
C	can you get rid of two and you get rid of three?
A	yeah
C	yeah? do that then maybe that's better than losing one of these cos we get the skill cards again we never get that back again
D	unless she's a Cylon and we're just we
C	and then I'm telling you
C	yeah
B	so I wanna keep the highest score don't I?
C	yes
B	yeah?
C	yeah keep the highest scores
B	so I lose two
D	is there a possibility that none of us are Cylons?
C	there is a possibility that nobody is a Cylon
D	oh right
C	so at this point now you know I said we need to jump and we need to get a score of eight
D	yes
C	when we get to a score of four we go into a sleeper phase where somebody wakes up from being a Cylon so we get dealt another loyalty card and that means that one of us is definitely a Cylon and if one of if any one of these are in the red when we get to that phase if this is in the red any one of them then there's only one Cylon in this game because we're already losing so
D	mm
C	they don't wanna make it too difficult but if we get to four out of eight and we're still in the blue somebody else will also be a Cylon there will be two and it'll be two on two so it depends where we are on this tactically you can actually try and make this just get into the red just when that happens so that you don't get a second Cylon
C	but that's getting a bit complicated you got rid of a red one okay
D	right so it's my go own isn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	I pick up two greens and erm oh
C	three greens and two purples there you go
B	so do we get this every time? each round?
C	every time yeah
B	every round okay
C	so you can get rid of them there's
D	well that's not a brilliant hand
C	yeah I've got a lot of low cards
A	me too
C	we're actually quite heavily under attack at the moment
D	right shall I take a what's it's called card now?
C	you haven't moved yet
D	oh oh of course I've gotta move before I take my
C	now there's a very sneaky one here called FTL control you can actually jump us prematurely if you want to
D	yeah
C	you can go to this location and jump us
D	FTL? faster than light?
C	yeah so you can jump us prematurely once we're out of the red and we're in the blue which we're in now
D	yeah
C	you can jump early
D	yeah I think
C	but when you jump you roll a dice if you lose you minus three population if you jump at this point
D	right
C	if you lose here you minus one population if you jump at this point
D	right
C	so jumping early bears a risk on your population
D	right
C	but you can do it
D	well look
A	I think it'd be worth it
D	looking at er
C	do you think it's worth it?
D	well looking at it tactically erm we've got a load we could clear all this all this space
C	mm
D	of
C	get everything off the board
D	death stars and that but I've gotta get a a die that is lower than three?
C	lower than a
D	seven or? what? on the dice? oh course it go oh course it's it's not it's not cuboid is it yeah
C	no
D	that's er chances of that are gonna be
D	is eight
C	hang on let me just have a quick look it goes up to eight
D	erm
C	FTL jump the current player rolls the die and if a six or lower is rolled then you lose the population so you need a seven or an eight to be okay
D	right so basically
C	so can anyone help with dad's die roll in any way? again I think it's purple I think it's tactics
C	are you gonna jump early? or are you gonna do a different move?
D	oh I've got a
A	think it's worth it
D	I've got a seventy-six percent chance of not of not getting it
B	can I use this one?
D	yeah
B	can
C	let's have a look
B	oh right
C	so
B	so it doesn't reduce what
C	doesn't reduce the roll no
D	right okay right
C	the the I think the one we're looking for is a purple one dad might have it in your purple cards?
D	and what's the purple one gonna say?
C	do you have one that say like reduce the die roll by two or something?
D	erm
C	let's have a look see if there's any in here that say it so I can show you
A	strategic planning maybe?
D	yes it's the purple's strategic planning but erm erm
C	ah here this one says play before any die roll to add two to the result but actually you do wanna add two to the result
D	yeah
C	cos you could get a four and then it gives you six do you know what I mean?
D	so er could I use my two if I got a six would that give me eight?
C	yeah have you got one that says that?
D	yes
C	yeah? so you add that in now and you gotta play it before the die roll not after
D	oh right oh I see right how about if I've got two of them?
C	you can only use one per round
D	damn it okay so I'm gonna use one of those
C	okay
D	so if I get er so now
C	so now you've bettered your chances
D	I've so I've gotta get six or higher
C	you've gotta get five or higher
D	five or higher
C	yeah
D	right
C	you can do it
A	yes that'll do
C	score you didn't even need it nice
D	it was better to
C	so we jump
D	yes
C	and we didn't lose any population so this goes back to zero
D	yeah
C	and all these things come off
D	come off yeah
C	including our own ships
D	yeah
C	you can help
D	where do these go?
C	just back where they belong
D	where did that go? I
D	so that's actually been quite helpful
C	yeah you've cleared the board
D	yes
C	so we're back to square one
D	yeah
C	we're not in trouble any more
D	no
C	although I added an I
D	okay
C	we can choose whether or not to play that because sometimes when you jump and you clear the board it can take ages before you get a card that brings Cylons back on
D	okay yeah for a bit of spice
C	and it can be a bit boring so
D	yeah we like it we like it spicy
C	just makes sure that there's always something against you rather than
D	yes that's good do I need to pick up oh I picked up some cards didn't I?
B	mm
C	yeah
B	you need one of those other ones don't you?
D	I need to pick up er one of those ones
C	you need one of the crisis cards don't you?
D	and everyone gets to see this do they not?
C	yes
D	right erm
A	do you want me to read it out for you?
D	yeah please do
A	right raiding party activate Cylon raiders
C	right yeah
A	do you wanna do this one? there's a lot to it
C	yeah ah it's another one of these again
C	these cards aren't that common so
D	yes
D	why do I
C	so let's ignore the fact that I said let's put one down
D	yes
C	let's not do that cos that'll make it too difficult so
D	cos that'll
C	well you
D	that was a great
C	we just jumped and they were back instantly
A	thanks dad
D	they they followed us
C	yeah
A	you must be a Cylon what's going on?
C	it's yeah
D	jumps yeah they kept jumping they were always
D	following them
C	so the first thing was activate the raiders but we don't
D	but we can't
C	we were already on zero so you can't move any further back than that that's the end
D	right
C	your go
B	my go?
C	yeah
B	right so
B	I need three and two please
C	okay
B	three yellow and two green
C	three yellow there you are
B	thank you
C	two green
C	okay what move would you like to make?
B	erm
C	so your choices of actions
B	right
C	you could move to a different location and do that as an action erm or you could do one of the actions that's on your skill cards
B	no I'll move she's been there for a little while
C	yeah
B	so
D	have you tried playing with your mum and
A	no
C	so there's three different ones on here this one was the draw the quorum cards that you did
B	yeah
C	this one is draw two more politics skill cards and then this one is we can choose a character pass the skill check and then they get the president title so you could give the presidency title to somebody else
B	but is it good to have it or not?
C	it's good to keep it yeah I think
B	okay so I won't do that then
D	mm
C	or you can discard a card
B	can I come onto?
C	and come over to this ship and do anything that's on here
B	yes I'll get rid of that card
C	okay discard a card and where would you like to go over here?
B	cos I've got two of them
C	okay where would you like to go?
A	Brig she's a Cylon
C	yeah
A	maybe she is that's er why she wants to come on our ship
D	mm
C	so you could activate two of these make two more ships out to defend us
B	yeah that sounds a good idea
C	yeah?
B	yeah
C	so you're gonna activate up to two unmanned vipers now your special ability is that you can jump in a viper
A	er yeah might be a good idea seeing as we we're being attacked
C	okay
A	can you put that on this side?
C	wait one second
B	are they good or bad?
C	these are good for us
B	right so we'll put two more on then please
C	two more on?
B	yeah
C	would you like em on this side? or this side? or one of each? or?
B	one of each
C	one of each
B	okay
C	okay
A	but I can't move
C	what does it say on your thing? I think it might say you get to take a move
A	when a viper pilot when a viper is placed in a space area from the reserves you may choose to pilot it and take one action
C	yeah cool
D	right
C	so you take an action now
A	okay cos can I move and shoot?
C	no you can only do one action
D	it's one action at a time
A	oh
D	that's two actions
A	that sucks erm tut I can't really do anything then
C	no you maybe don't wanna move in here cos then it's their round
C	and they'll attack you you wanna be on the offensive
D	and you'll get blasted back into sickbay again
A	can I take an action off of these?
C	you can do yeah
A	yeah er
C	but you still only get one action are you cold
B	mm
C	bless you do you wanna wrap like a blanket round you? or?
D	do you want do you want a
B	no it's alright er no I've got a fleece on
D	no but you want the the heavier one like?
B	no no no no I'm fine
C	sleeping bag?
D	do you want the?
B	I'll put I'll put my blanket on if I need it but I'm alright thank you
D	say just we'll stop for a tea break to have a cup of tea of something
A	yeah can't do anything
C	no? okay
D	right
C	so no moves
A	yeah
B	right so don't I have to er take one of those other cards?
A	crisis
C	yeah so you did your action
B	I did my action
C	yeah and now
B	and I moved it into the other
C	and now you take one of these cards
B	now I have to take one of those
C	but you get two and you get to choose one of them that's just your
B	right how many can I have of these?
C	they go back every time you don't keep them
B	oh right I'm
C	have you been keeping them?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b didn't do their action	Contradiction
B	I've got loads here
D	no the erm
C	no they're your special quorum cards
D	no
C	that one however should've come back
B	right
C	these are different
B	right okay
C	so you've got your loyalty card in there and then you've got your special quorum cards but this one should've gone back
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has kept their cards	Entailment
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has twelve cards	Entailment
B	right so oh yes erm
C	oh we jumped earlier sorry didn't do this when we jump the
B	oh
C	and gets to have a look at them and decide which one we choose
D	only me?
C	so remember we're trying to get to a power of eight so you need to choose either one that takes us far but is damaging or one that doesn't take us so far and is less damaging
D	no I can read it it's just erm er you were saying about the
C	so let's have a look at these ones together normally you'd look on your own one's got a three and one's got a one
D	yes
C	we wanna get further so we want the three but the three has a negative lose three fuel
D	yes the
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b and speaker c are good childhood friends	Neutral
C	which is pretty
D	but that gets us three up here doesn't it?'
C	yeah but we need to get to eight and another jump
D	yeah
C	and that would take er nearly half of our fuel away the other one
D	how much fuel does it take away?
C	three
D	oh right well yeah that's yes
D	so we're gonna have to go for the er
[ANNOTATION]	another jump would take away all of the fuel	Contradiction
C	the other one is a one and it says lose one fuel
D	and I've gotta roll a dice
C	and then you can roll a die and maybe gain two fuel
D	yes that
[ANNOTATION]	speaker d must not roll a die now	Contradiction
C	so which one do you wanna choose?
D	it's got to be the latter er hasn't it?
C	okay so this one we didn't do
D	right
C	we've now jumped to a stage of one so one of eight isn't that didn't jump us very far at all
[ANNOTATION]	there is nothing they have to choose at this point	Contradiction
D	no
C	erm so now you roll a die
D	and do we lose a raptor?
C	erm we may may risk a raptor to roll a die
D	right and what?
C	if three or higher gain two fuel
D	right
C	otherwise if it's one or two we destroy the raptor
D	right so I've gotta get higher than three
C	yeah well three or higher nice so we actually gain two fuel so that helped us so we go up to nine
D	right okay
C	cool
B	now what do I do with these two cards?
C	er they're your crisis
B	yeah
C	so now it's your crisis you choose one
B	yeah okay
C	if you're a Cylon choose one that damages us if you're a human choose one that helps us
D	okay I don't pick one of those cards up yet?
C	that wasn't your go
D	okay
C	it's just we kinda went back a bit
D	okay right
B	okay we'll have to use this one then can I show you?
C	okay yeah so that's what we're playing
B	yeah that's the one we're discarding
C	and that's the one we're discarding oh good yeah that one's dangerous
B	yeah?
C	they're actually
B	yeah well
C	so what does this one say?
B	that's
C	admiral chooses do you wanna read it dad?
D	er read it to me son
A	sure
D	er
C	saying something different
A	er I'll tell you there's only one choice
D	mm
A	right this is called rescue mission the choice is either minus one morale and the current player is sent to sickbay or minus one fuel and destroy one raptor
C	so we actually played this card before
A	yeah
C	we did do a similar card
D	is the
C	so one morale and
D	yes
C	or one fuel and lose a raptor
D	well
C	okay you go to sickbay
B	are the raptors good then?
C	we get er we only get four of them in the whole game so you can't keep risking them
D	yeah so if destroy them if we
B	I haven't been to sickbay yet have I?
A	no
B	oh yes I have
C	no
B	no it was
B	yeah no
B	okay then
A	we've we've lost one anyway
B	erm
A	it's your choice so
D	yes well
D	yeah
C	and
B	oh
C	sorry
D	right and this card goes
B	okay
C	that goes over here
B	quite used to that
D	whose go is it now?
C	mine one politics two leadership and would you grab me two blue ones
B	one
C	one
B	two
C	two thanks
D	oh
C	nothing happened
C	er that that was my go
D	right okay
B	oh
C	that was terrible so I do a crisis card okay this one is the power of twelve green and yellow can people help much on that?
A	not really
C	we pass it we fail it also these activate
B	I can help quite a lot
C	nice
D	I
C	so can I
A	I can't really help
C	so if we win this then I get to look at someone's loyalty card mm
D	loyalty card? which one's?
C	the one that says whether you're a Cylon or not
D	oh I see right yeah yeah mm
C	I'm a little suspicious of
D	yeah I'm er tending to have a leaning towards that as well
C	so we'll see
B	is that because I'm the only woman?
A	no
B	right so perhaps I won't let you have my cards then
B	and then you can't
C	so these two actually move round and that's terrible luck cos once these get in we're screwed
D	right
C	we go up one other jump track and now we bet so this is face down so we don't know so if you're a Cylon now you wanna try and sabotage this but chances are
D	right is this the
C	twelve yeah
D	twelve?
B	so is it to my advantage to give it to you or not? if you're if you're going to erm
C	are you a Cylon then?
B	I'm not gonna
D	if you're if you're a
C	no you don't have to play them
D	no
C	you could put in the colours that negate it
D	yes
C	you could put in red and and blue and whatever
D	yes
C	so it goes against it
D	yes
C	however if we put these cards out turn them and there's like five negative cards in there we know that somebody's definitely
D	right
C	somebody's cos er I just put two random ones in
D	right
C	these could be for or against us
D	okay
C	therefore there could always be two negative cards in the pack so if someone puts a negative one these are both negative then we definitely know someone's a Cylon cos there's three negative cards
D	right
C	but it's a risk you take as a Cylon is
C	okay how much can you help
A	only a little bit what colour was it?
B	green or yellow
C	green or yellow
A	okay
C	good dad are you putting in?
D	I can yeah
C	just put them face down you don't wanna show em
D	right okay
B	I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing to be honest
C	erm
B	you want?
C	putting points to win power of twelve
B	yes
C	with your coloured green or yellow
B	yeah
D	have you got
B	yes I
C	yeah
D	cos you don't necessarily have to
C	if you're human
B	ah so is it?
C	if you're not then you're gonna wanna play it a little bit differently you want us not to do this
A	but you wanna not tell us
B	so
C	yes to pass this
D	yes
B	right
C	this bet
B	okay er
A	okay
C	just one?
D	just one
C	er just putting one in okay
D	oh I thought that she had more than
B	how many have you got to do?
D	as many
C	twelve between all of us
B	alright then I'll put two in
C	okay I'm gonna I'll
B	I don't know what I'm doing anyway so
D	you're winning by the way
C	that's the thing we're all on the same team really so it's
A	well unless someone is a Cylon
C	okay I'm gonna put another one in someone should be a Cylon whoever they are
D	I think someone is
B	yeah I think someone is I know who it is
B	pardon?
C	well it must you then mustn't it? it's either you or
A	why are you being suspicious of me bro?
D	mm
C	I should probably say at this point if you are a Cylon there's something special that you can do if you are a Cylon
B	mm
C	you can reveal yourself as a Cylon at any point in the game when you reveal you get rid of all your skill cards you can't do the special abilities that's on your card and you no longer on this ship you move to the Cylon area and you have different abilities that you can do and only you can do and you also receive a super crisis card which is like one of these but worse
D	mm
C	basically for us for the humans
C	but if you are a Cylon and your people aren't sure that you're a Cylon it's better to stay unrevealed cos you can do more
D	more damage
C	subtle damage at the beginning
D	you yes it's better to be on the inside of the tender
C	yeah
D	er rather than on the outside
C	once you get up here you can get a bit stuck with what you do so
D	yeah
A	what happens if you're not a Cylon but you claim to be a Cylon?
D	well
C	you can do that also we've had that in a game
D	oh right
C	someone claimed to be a Cylon
D	oh right
A	so does that make you a
D	they'd just go to the Brig
C	yeah
C	yeah so I shuffle these up and see
A	so is that what you do? you just put em in the Brig?
C	yeah you can do yeah if you think they're a Cylon
A	but like they don't get to go to the Cylon side?
C	so if we think
A	but how would we check that she is?
C	she can get to be she can still reveal but she doesn't get the special ability on her reveal card if she's in the Brig
D	mm
C	so some special ability right pair of three six nine that's eleven thirteen fifteen we've won it so far but what? oh god minus three we're down to twelve back up again sixteen we've easily done it nice so either somebody put one in somewhere and
D	it's not rocket science
A	I'm not the only one
C	or both of those cards were from here
D	yes
C	we don't know
D	no
C	cos there's only two
D	so we're
C	so there's a chance that nobody was the Cylon
D	we're no really wiser
C	mm
D	not really if there was three
C	yeah
D	we'd know definitely that
C	we'd know definitely
D	that that someone was a
C	someone was a Cylon
D	Cylon yeah
C	but now my Cylon radar has changed direction from
A	why do you suspect me?
C	cos your laughing too much
D	er what happens now then? when we've we've
C	so
B	I'm not gonna say anything I mean it might be er detrimental to my position
D	is erm?
C	you
D	we we passed that erm so what happens now? we
C	now we passed it so I get to look at someone's loyalty card
D	okay
C	so who do I trust the least basically?
D	yeah yes
C	at the minute I trust
C	give me your loyalty card
D	and you can now choose to expose him or or?
D	yes
C	so we know who is a Cylon
A	mm
D	either that or my poker face is
C	yeah
D	mm
C	if you suspect
A	mm
D	you can't become a Cylon though can you? because of
C	you can become a there's another Cylon card in here
D	oh right cos I thought in in the films you couldn't become one you either are one cos you're not human
C	there's a sleeper agent
D	oh right
C	so you you wake up
D	oh you
C	and you yeah
D	oh I see so you are actually one but you don't realise you're one
D	right oh I see yeah
A	right can I get my one purple?
C	yeah
A	two reds and er
C	er we can all get green I think
D	yeah
A	but how many people can get yellow?
D	I can get
B	I can get yellow
D	I can get the most leadership
C	I can get yellow and green
B	so can I
D	I can only get green and and
D	I can get three green every time
C	okay one green one yellow
D	all the greens are all the greens are
C	you might wanna try and get
A	how do we do that?
B	there's an awful lot of talking might erm just might be you
D	yeah
B	yes it might just be so er
D	yeah
A	so how to we get
D	yes
B	that's entirely up to
B	he can choose what he likes
A	how do we actually get anyone in the Brig?
C	to get her in the Brig we have to go to the admiral's quarters this position and then we vote to get her in there now if she is a Cylon she can vote against that
D	mm
C	to stop us from getting her in the Brig but it's quite low it's only a seven to get her in
D	mm
C	but it's purples and greens and I don't have any purples
B	neither do I
D	is it purples?
C	mm to get someone in the Brig
D	I've got
C	but dad's good with the purples
D	yeah I'm good with the purples
B	mm
A	three's more than most of us
D	I've got quite
C	what's your move
A	right
C	I mean to tell you honestly we've got two of these that are about to board which are kind of nasty
A	I'm gonna use one of my reds maximum firepower action
C	okay so you're gonna attack these?
A	yeah
C	yeah they're really hard to kill you have to roll a seven or an eight to destroy them
A	flipping hell
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a game	Entailment
C	yeah I know
D	and he's got four rolls?
C	he's got four rolls yeah can we add anything this roll?
D	er
C	it is a purple one that says before die roll add two to something or other
C	oh no that was that green one that you had
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about number of rolls	Neutral
A	I might have that as well
C	it says play before oh no it's not that one I'm getting confused
D	I've got
C	it's a purple one
D	I've got
B	so you said
A	it is the purple one?
C	yeah it's the purple one
D	I've got action risk one raptor to roll a die if free on fire
C	no it's not that it's not that one
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure about color	Entailment
D	look at the top card and I've got play before any die roll two
A	that one
C	that one
D	I've got two of those
C	do you want to put that down?
D	yeah
C	or maybe wait until he's done two rolls cos he might get it
[ANNOTATION]	person C is not sure done two rolls or not	Neutral
A	yeah
C	and then you you waste the card
D	yes
C	so wait until he's done two
D	okay so he's gotta get eight?
C	yeah seven or an eight
D	er within four within four rolls?
C	yeah but he's got two of them to kill
D	right
A	right
C	nice
A	ah
[ANNOTATION]	person A is agree with them	Entailment
C	so you killed one perfect these are really dangerous if they get in and that gets up every time you see that icon on a card they go up by one so you can only see it four times and then
D	once it's all over at the end
C	then they die
D	yeah
A	right and again
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
C	so you've got three more rolls
A	damn
C	okay two more rolls
D	two more rolls do you want?
A	nah
D	right on the last roll?
A	wait until the last one
C	oh so you might wanna play that card
C	okay so you get to add two
D	two
C	so you only need a five
A	yes
C	nice
D	that'll do nice one
C	draw
A	okay
C	what does is it say bro?
A	order sabotaged we need thirteen
C	mm
A	and you can use yellow green or purple the effects if we pass are none if we fail we lose two food or we lose one food if we don't roll
C	okay yeah if we just choose
A	yeah
C	so what do we think?
A	there's also a jump in there
C	there's a jump and a raider so do we think we can make thirteen?
C	there's three colours there's yellow green and purple
D	I can do a reasonable er contribution
A	I can do a reasonable contribution
C	I can pull my weight I can definitely pull my wait
B	I can do a reasonable one
C	so shall we go for it?
D	let's go for it
C	okay so first things first we get two from the destiny deck so we don't know what they are dad you add in what you can
D	er do I put them in top of those?
C	yeah without showing em
D	yep okay
D	do we need?
C	now you can shuffle these
D	we need fourteen was it?
A	do I have to?
C	well I mean I guess I can do it
D	do we need fourteen?
C	so yeah we need thirteen to win
D	right
C	but we don't wanna know if a Cylon has put in so purple counts one three blue is against so we're back down to one that's four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty nice caned it
D	right
C	er so either maybe someone put this in or it came from the destiny deck we don't know
D	no
C	okay so we did it
D	so nothing lost
C	yeah pass no effect nothing happened
D	right
C	we just
D	so does that make it my
C	yeah so it's your go
D	right so I pick up
D	sorry?
C	so
D	yeah that's what I mean I need three
B	yeah
D	I need three and two three greens two
B	yeah three what?
D	three green three greens two purples
B	one two three three greens and two purples?
D	yeah
B	one two
C	oh hang on
B	oh
C	forgot to do something
A	oh yeah
C	we didn't do the jump and we didn't activate the raiders so these raiders come round and these raiders come round if er if we see this and there are no raiders on the board and there's a basestar it adds raiders like more come out of it
D	right okay
B	we just went to the next player
C	we just
B	and forgot
D	right
C	okay your go
D	no it's the crisis card isn't it?
C	yeah yeah
D	yeah
C	it was the last crisis card
D	right okay
C	we'd already done it
D	right so it's my go now erm I can put well I could
C	no
A	it's possible she's not actually a Cylon
D	yeah
C	I wish I'd looked at yours
D	right
C	or you can discard a card and come up here and try and take the presidency from
D	right
C	if you think that she's a Cylon
D	I'll take I'm gonna take a
C	so you're gonna move to here and you get one engineering
D	and one
C	or one tactics card sorry
D	oh right
C	you only get one
D	okay
B	you've got an engineering
C	you got your engineering?
D	yeah
C	cool that's your go
C	now you get a crisis card
D	and er
C	oh no
B	oh
C	yeah I did
B	gosh
C	yeah
C	this really
D	there's another basestar
C	there's another basestar at the back
A	dangerously close to me
C	yep
A	and they activate so I'm gonna get shot
C	or oh actually that's a point they activate first before I do this there's something it says on the card they activate and this is the basestar attacked us
D	right
C	so dad you need to roll a die
D	and what do I am I looking for?
C	erm you want lower than a four
D	right
C	one two or three
C	ah seven
A	oh woah
C	seven is erm
D	not good
C	we've been damaged so you need now to choose one of these at random we've got one two three four five six seven
D	I'll take two
C	two
D	yeah
C	turn it see the picture on it? that's command that's
D	okay
C	that has to be fixed
D	right
C	so I'll have to go and fix it now we add
A	we didn't roll for the erm for the raiders
C	what do you mean roll for them?
A	well didn't they attack?
C	no only the basestar attacked
A	oh okay
C	that symbol just means the basestar attacks erm what else gets set up? so do you wanna jump into one of these? oh you're already in one
B	mm
C	you could potentially jump into another one if you were somewhere else on the board erm
A	couldn't I technically jump into that one and take my action?
C	yeah you can do that
A	I wanna do that then
C	yeah alright
A	okay and I'll
C	okay
C	roll a die then
D	just one
D	what's he gotta get?
C	he's gotta get a three to eight to destroy her nice so one of these is gone
A	good
C	okay that was worth doing special rule training new pilots keep this card in play until the fleet jumps each unmanned viper suffers a minus two penalty to its attack rolls
A	oh no
C	so while this is currently in play when you're attacking with er er maybe we should've probably happened before that you get minus two on your on the die that you just rolled so that stays in play for now okay
B	this is your go isn't it?
C	yeah
D	yes
C	that was your
B	have you got taken have you taken your crisis card?
C	yeah we just did it
D	yeah that yeah the crisis card
B	oh that was that was it?
C	yeah
C	three yellow
C	okay now you have an action we need to
D	I've got to get into the FTL haven't I?
C	yeah we still need to go up one more before we can even jump
D	okay right how do we get up to that next one?
C	we see the little markers at the bottom
D	oh right yeah
C	I think you've got it now I think you understand the game it's pretty straight forward once you get going just at first there's so many pieces
D	mm
C	it's
C	yeah
B	right it says here action choose any other player he may move his character and then take one action or not move and take two actions
C	yeah
B	limit one action order card use per turn right you can go
C	oh okay thank you so
B	right
C	you give me that card
B	yeah as opposed to me going?
C	and I get two actions or a move and an action so I'm gonna send you to the Brig
B	okay
C	erm I can't I need to repair something I think
B	do I not finish my go by taking one of those other cards?
C	yeah I do my go first
B	first right and then come back to that? right okay
C	and then and then you do it and then it'll be my proper go
B	oh right
C	so
A	she just wants to rush us into another crisis
D	mm
C	yeah
C	okay so I'm gonna move to here
B	I thought you said you couldn't use that area it was bad
D	cos it's damaged
C	yeah I'm about to repair it
B	oh right sorry
C	yeah I can I'm the Chief
C	yeah
C	so this is damaged I'm gonna use an engineering card so my first action was to move my second action is to use my engineering card
D	to repair it yeah
C	I repair it that's now repaired and part of my special ability is that during my turn after I use a repair skill card you may take another action once per turn so I get another go mm and my action is to activate up to two
A	which means that I can jump into one
D	yep
A	yeah we have
C	so I've only got one to launch
D	right
A	that that will give me a go
C	there you go so you've launched into it
A	that should give me a go
C	yeah so
A	yeah but it takes two off my roll
D	yes cos of that card
C	yeah
A	yeah
D	so you've gotta
C	so you need a five to eight to destroy it not three to eight nice
A	yes
C	so that's gone
C	destroyed and
B	can you pass me the card please? thank you
C	oh you get two don't you? cos you're the president
B	yes
D	oh you get a choice don't you?
B	so that's er
C	what's your special ability dad? who are you?
D	er
A	he's Adama
D	I'm Adama erm special ability where does that say that? er
C	so it's erm
A	one of these two do you want me to read it out?
D	yeah special
C	let's have a look
D	special ability
C	it says erm when you draw a crisis card all one strength skill cards count positive for your skill check so you know when we drew one of these?
D	yeah
C	if you drew it
D	yeah
C	any card that's put down in any colour as long as it's number one helps us
D	number
C	that's your special ability
D	right number one what do you
C	one two three four five do you remember in the corner? it says this one's a three that one's a one that one's a three
D	oh yeah yeah
C	so any ones even if they're against that
D	okay
C	colour
D	oh right
C	help us
D	so a two wouldn't but a one would
C	that's your special ability yeah
D	yeah yeah okay
C	that's your special ability you have another special ability once per game after resolving a skill check which is this instead of discarding the skill cards so all those skill cards in that pile that we put back you can keep those cards
D	even though it's more than
C	yeah
D	the ten?
C	but that's only one once per game you can do that
D	right okay
C	so everyone has a once per game thing and then a thing that you can do every time
B	right I've got in here it says a pass and a fail or something else
C	yeah so you can just choose the or without doing the vote or we can vote and get the pass or fail
C	oh
D	mm
C	I need a glass of water
D	mm
C	oh can I drink it?
A	I dunno whose it is
C	oh it's mine
B	no yours is behind you
A	er oh is that mine?
C	they're both mine
B	yeah
D	let's stop in fifteen for a quick erm make a cuppa tea or
A	well I just had a sip out of it are you
D	mm
A	did I?
D	and he
C	cheers
D	mm
C	what are you thinking
B	I'm thinking
A	she's plotting
B	I can't
C	no not at all let's have a look
B	right
C	so this one
B	er yeah
C	if we pass and beat twelve we plus a fuel that's a good thing
B	right
C	if we fail it we didn't make twelve then we minus a fuel and destroy a raptor
B	mm
C	or instead of trying to do the skills check
B	yeah
C	you can just roll a die and if it's four or lower we minus a fuel
B	so there's bad
C	so you've got like this one is fifty-fifty
B	so er
D	yeah
B	right
C	either nothing happens or we win a fuel
B	so that one if I do that one we just pass?
C	if we pass it nothing happens so we're okay
B	happens that's better isn't it?
C	if we get seven plus the current player discards two skill cards and if we fail it we lose a morale normally this card would be better
B	right
C	however this card has a plus of fuel and you don't very often get plus something
B	right okay
C	so it's worth trying to do that
B	right
C	so you might wanna ask people how good are you for purple and red? and probably we'll find we're not very good for purple and red so
B	are you?
D	what what's the the numbers
B	we've got to make twelve
C	so how much can everyone contribute for purple and red?
B	nothing
D	erm
A	very little
C	I can't help at all
B	neither can I
C	so we don't want that one
B	no
C	we're not gonna pass it so
B	no okay so
C	let's get rid of that one
B	okay
C	and we'll put the other one on
D	no
C	some different characters have more reds and more purples we've picked characters that have like
D	mm
C	no reds really no purple so nine pass no effect seven plus you discard two skill cards if we fail we lose a morale and you also discard two skill cards we jump up one and the heavy raiders launch there isn't any on the board so we launch one out of this basestar and we launch one out of this basestar so we get two of those on the board and now we need to vote nine yellow and green
B	mm
D	yellow and green?
C	so we get two from the destiny deck I go first I can only help a little bit
D	I can only help a little bit
B	I can help a lot
C	good
A	I can't help
B	how many cards can I put down?
C	you might wanna help
C	you can put a many as you want in
D	and and the colour's purple and what? yellow?
C	no the colour is yellow and green
D	oh yellow and green?
B	yeah
D	oh I can help quite a lot then
C	tut
D	sorry I thought it was
D	sorry I thought it was purple I can
C	he keeps telling us he's got loads of purples
D	I can really help it's green I can really help
C	cool add add in but bearing in mind now
B	oh I can't take mine back now?
C	you can do
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D did not make any color mistake.	Contradiction
B	well no
C	no? okay
D	and what's the score we're looking for?
C	twelve nine
D	there you go you add em up
C	right cool so we still don't know if
D	shuffle
C	anyone's a Cylon yet
[ANNOTATION]	It's easy for speaker D do perform calculations.	Neutral
D	no shuffle em first
C	oh dad's a Cylon he might be requesting we shuffle
D	mm just following the rule
C	glad no one suspects me
D	mm
A	we should hold a vote
C	yeah
B	you
C	not me I can't get purple
B	can't you?
C	no purples
B	oh okay
C	you can't either
[ANNOTATION]	Most speakers like following the rules.	Neutral
B	no
C	dad can get purples
B	yes
D	mm
C	but it may not have been a purple it could've been a a blue but somebody's put something in there so it's five six seven eight nine against and what did I say?
[ANNOTATION]	No one can get the purple ones.	Contradiction
B	we were up to seventeen at one stage
A	what are we looking for?
B	twelve aren't we?
D	we've done it
C	but
A	mm
C	who do you think it is bro?
A	could be dad
C	do you reckon?
A	I dunno we thought it was
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers found twelve.	Entailment
C	she was making us think it was her okay that was your crises crisis my go one yellow
B	nope
A	she's got them but she doesn't use them
D	she's stacking em up
A	they're probably all too beneficial for us
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Some things are used and not saved.	Contradiction
A	cos she's a Cylon so
C	not helping us okay we have quite a bit of stuff on here do you think I should jump?
D	yes
C	and risk it
D	if you can
C	yeah
D	well we're we're in the right position to jump aren't we?
C	we'll risk three population but I mean we jumped last time and nothing happened so
D	yeah
C	shall we risk it again?
D	yes
C	does anyone have something to add? minus?
C	is there any way of doing that?
D	in what? in
A	add to the roll
C	yeah we don't wanna we do wanna add to the roll does anyone have one that adds to the roll? it's a purple one I think
A	could we add a a negative to a roll?
B	when am I supposed to use these cards?
C	erm let's have a look at what they are
B	hang on hang on hang on
C	not the loyalty card yeah
D	I've got action risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher
A	no it's not that one
D	that's not it? it's not that one either
C	so this one allows you to draw two politics cards er whenever you use it and then you give it to somebody and then so basically this one so
A	mm so if
C	er
A	if we don't trust the admiral
C	yeah
D	mm
C	then we can give this so if you don't trust the admiral if you think that he's a Cylon and when we jump he's gonna choose where we go he's already given us a low one last time one
D	mm
C	not three
D	mm
C	then you could give this card to say me and then I get to choose these cards next time
B	mm
C	this one you draw two politics cards keep this card in play while this player is not the president other players may not be chosen with the administration location so it's basically saying if you give this to me while I'm not the president we cannot elect a new president here with this thing so it's just saying that that doesn't work basically and the last one just as it says destroy
C	one heavy raider or one centurion
D	but you wouldn't wanna do that if you were a Cylon
C	then roll a die so you could help us destroy some of this stuff
A	but we're gonna jump
B	but when do I use them?
B	right
C	and that's an option
C	no yeah so I'm gonna roll I need a seven or an eight to be okay ah does anyone have anything to add to the die roll?
D	what's that? no
C	six no so we minus three population
A	oh
D	and we don't jump
D	oh we do yeah
C	but with minus three population so clear the board
D	board
C	yeah we leave it
B	can we take everything off?
C	yeah
B	oh
C	oh gosh
D	er can these come off?
C	that's
B	oh right
D	everything's off
C	these all go into the hangar there
D	these ones here
C	yeah they go over there just in the Cylon pile
D	that's another one of those what's it's called?
C	that goes there
D	right
C	okay so we jumped that was my move I'm now pulling a crisis
D	er we're probably back to square one
A	another annihilation
C	right we go up one oh so we jumped dad you get to choose two of these cards
D	right do I er just see if?
D	I see them just myself don't I?
C	yeah
B	but did you say did you say that I need to use one of these cards but I've got to wait till my?
C	yeah you've gotta wait till your turn now
B	right okay
C	but you could've selected me to choose these rather than dad erm win that card he selects two now to look at but when you give me that card I can look at three so it increases my chances of picking a decent one as well
D	do I read this out to you or not?
C	no you gotta choose as the admiral we don't know whether you're a Cylon or not so it's your choice
D	how many raptors have we got left?
C	three you can sacrifice a raptor if you need to if it's worth it we wanna jump far if there's a three that might be good
A	there isn't many raptors what are the other ships we got?
C	these erm vipers
D	we're looking at the numerical er
C	yeah
D	can we afford to lose two fuel?
C	we got quite a bit of fuel we've got above what we started with
D	okay
C	so I'd say we probably can
D	so what do I do now? just say to you?
C	you choose one
D	do I reveal it?
C	yeah
A	I don't think you have to reveal the other option though
C	no you don't reveal the option you didn't choose
D	no I'm not going to
C	okay so give me that one
D	lose two fuel
C	so we don't know what this one was
D	no that gives us two towards the aim doesn't it?
C	so we only jumped two yeah so we're not even at the sympathiser stage
D	mm
C	next time we jump there will be another Cylon there will definitely be a Cylon next time we jump
D	mm
C	so we're now up to three we lose two
A	someone's definitely a Cylon now
D	mm
C	yeah I think so too it's probably dad it's not
C	right cool where were we up to? it was my go I pulled a crisis card okay president chooses right first thing we go up one on the jump basestar attacks my go I roll a die where's the die? here oh what was it?
D	under my feet
B	no it's not
A	she's gonna roll it over if if she's the Cylon
[ANNOTATION]	There are no Cylons yet.	Contradiction
C	have we lost it?
B	no
D	sabotage
B	here
C	have you got it
[ANNOTATION]	They had to pull the crisis card because they rolled a six.	Neutral
A	no re-roll
A	they're your nukes
D	er yes
C	yeah you can nuke things that's your action
A	can you nuke our own ship?
C	no
D	no
C	you can nuke the basestars and stuff so you might've wanted to use those earlier
D	er I didn't I'd forgot I had them when can I use em? when it's my go?
C	yeah when it's your go
D	and I can just and that's my action?
C	yeah you get a die roll when you're attacking them with a nuke you only need a one to two to damage it twice
D	so if I throw
[ANNOTATION]	If you nuke them twice you win the game.	Neutral
C	a three to six you destroy it and a seven to eight you destroy it and three raiders in the area
D	right okay so I've got my two nukes I didn't realise it I'd forgot all about my nukes thank you for helping me out with that
C	so the basestar attacked it got a three nothing happens we're okay
D	mm
C	so that was low so now the president chooses mm you got your
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D already used their nukes, so they are not available anymore.	Contradiction
D	yes I have haven't I?
B	you can either minus one food or the president discards two skill cards and then the current player
A	how are we doing for food?
C	well I can afford to lose skill cards how about you?
D	I've been too generous with my skill cards
A	you've got nothing left
B	yeah I haven't got many
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D has many skill cards.	Contradiction
D	yeah
B	so
C	go for discard?
B	yes if you like
C	so you discard two I discard three?
B	yep
[ANNOTATION]	They want this game to end because they have been playing for three days,	Neutral
C	is that right?
B	yep
C	okay
B	here you go
C	done
B	and that's your card back
C	okay good okay so we survived that one
A	okay can I get one purple two red?
C	will somebody do that while I sort these ones out?
B	one purple?
A	two red
B	two red
A	and two green
B	and two green two green
A	thank you
C	okay what's your move bro?
C	are you sure you're not cold
D	mm
C	you look so chilly
C	right
C	er oh I got rid of all my wrong cards I've just left myself the three ones
D	mm
C	that was what I was meant to discard
A	alright I wanna see what my options are
C	what are you looking at? three?
A	where's my dude?
C	yeah you're there
A	I wanna send dad to the Brig
C	right
D	I'm er I'm the I'm the admiral you can't do that
A	it certainly isn't the admiral's orders to send you to the Brig
C	do you wanna protest that? do you
D	no
C	just say no?
D	no
C	you're just admitting that you're a Cylon?
D	no
C	okay cool let's send him to the Brig so we need a seven power of seven purple and green
D	I obviously won't vote in with this one
C	you can vote
D	what to to keep me in?
C	you can vote against it to stop you you can either vote to put you in or you can vote to stop you from going in so if you don't wanna go in the Brig then you wanna put colours against it
B	well I can't help with that I'm afraid
D	what's the benefit of me going in the Brig?
C	mm er to you? if you're a Cylon? none you don't wanna go in the Brig
D	no
C	if er there's just no benefit to go into the Brig
D	no that's what I'm thinking so I'm gonna have to vote against it yeah
C	unless you're human I guess right are you ready
A	yeah
C	so we're putting two of these in it's green and purple
D	okay what's the score? we've got to get seven?
C	yeah
D	what? to keep me in? or get me out?
C	to put you in the Brig
D	right okay
C	woah
D	er mine
B	I can't help
C	can't help at all
D	mine count against don't they? even though
C	yeah well only if it's opposite colours if you put in green and
D	oh
C	you wanna put in different colours like red or blue
D	I don't
C	cool
A	I know
D	I don't have any other colours
C	how much do I need to help
A	you don't need anything
C	although we did add two random cards
A	well maybe put in a few then if you wanna see him in the Brig
C	okay let's see
D	this is a bit of a mutiny
C	did dad go in the Brig?
A	how long do we keep him in the Brig for? just one turn?
C	erm he's gotta vote to get out
A	oh I see
C	and if we don't want him to get out we vote against him
A	he's got no cards
C	no
C	and you don't pick up any cards in the Brig either it's a bit problematic
D	oh well I'm stuffed then
C	so oh oh these
A	oh no
C	how did that happen?
A	what?
D	too late now
A	I didn't put any in
C	I didn't I put in these little ones
D	I didn't put any in
C	and dad
D	I didn't put any
A	no but I didn't put any
C	which
A	you've sabotaged this
C	I haven't
B	did you draw two?
C	yeah I did draw two
D	yeah
C	but somehow there's three
D	so what's the score
C	I haven't sabotaged it I didn't even have those cards
C	maybe I did put a yellow in by a mistake actually'
D	what's the more importantly what's the score?
C	oh god three four five six
D	right so
A	no
D	so what happens now then?
A	just blew my go for nothing
D	so er so it's my go now?
C	you
A	you're still scot-
C	yeah
D	okay
A	you're still scot-free
C	that shouldn't have happened
D	your crisis is gonna be the I
A	yeah
D	the coup failed
C	mm
A	we have to roll and eight which is only yellows and greens if we win there's no effect if we fail there's minus one no if we get less than a five we lose one morale if we fail we lose one morale and the president discards four skill cards
C	oh that's quite a lot how many do you have?
B	two
C	only two so that's not an option then
C	let's have a look
A	what would happen if
C	she can't
C	she has to have four to discard
A	so surely we can still fail?
C	let's have a look
D	it means you're only you're forced to do one only one of only one thing
C	I mean yeah fail if
D	no
C	but if it's failed and she only had two then that's fine
A	yeah so shall we just let it fail?
D	you've got no option
C	you still have to vote on it regardless of whether it fails or not
A	yeah
C	so we need to make a new destiny deck for a start
A	yeah
C	and it's power of eight? how much can people help?
D	what's the colour?
C	yellow and green
D	no
D	I know because
C	getting to be an old man then
A	he knows I've been looking at his cards
A	is that why he's
D	no that's
B	I can't help much
A	alright I'll make my contribution after you've put those in
C	okay so first thing that happens is this releases one of these because of this picture we go up one on the jump track okay and let's vote dad you go first
D	I can't cos I've got I've got no cards
B	can I put all both in there?
C	yeah of course you can yeah
D	and what's the score we're trying to erm?
C	beat eight
A	no
C	you didn't get em into the Brig bro what happened?
A	mm
D	what happened to er what happens to
C	erm she has to discard all her skill cards
D	oh right all of them?
B	I haven't got any
C	but she just got rid of em anyway
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	so that was er beneficial and we lose a morale we don't want that to happen okay one two three four five six oh four two zero we got minus one
A	oh no
C	we failed that quite chronically
D	yeah
B	it was only a seven
C	yeah so we got minus one
A	oh no
B	that's you again
C	so
D	I never contributed
A	he didn't even put any in
B	didn't he? oh
C	so we got who's doing that?
C	I know
D	well one thing's for certain
A	what are the what's the chance of there being more than one at the beginning?
C	there can't be no you can't have more than one
D	so the erm the fact that unless I'm somehow erm putting cards in when I'm clearly not visually openly
B	I haven't got any cards left
A	yeah
C	are you?
A	no
C	I saw your loyalty card it's these two
D	he's got two loyalty cards he showed you the one that he wanted you to see
C	how did we fail that? there's
D	right so what's a fail? we lost er a morale?
C	yeah so we lose a morale morale goes down
D	what's how low is morale now then?
C	eight morale's still okay but we haven't even jumped halfway yet okay so whose go is it now? whose go was that?
A	that was mine
C	it was
D	so it's mine
C	so dad your go
B	what cards do you want?
D	erm three of the green two of the purple fortunately I can pick up cards cos I'm not in the Brig
C	yeah three of the green two of the purple
D	thank you
A	this is where he tries to put me in the Brig with his cards
C	yeah
D	I don't need cards to do that I'm
C	mm just put you in we could vote against it
A	yeah but but like if you didn't have enough
C	I know you didn't
A	or didn't really care
C	yeah
C	I looked at your loyalty card so I know you're a human
A	yeah I haven't seen yours though
A	mm
C	what was your purpose there?
A	but this is assuming that you're human we don't know
C	no we don't know I'm human believe me
B	mm
D	I can take some more cards without moving can I not?
A	if you go to the right place
C	if you go to the right location yeah
D	er the right location again was er where am I? er this one?
C	yeah you can draw one engineering or one tactics or you can come up here and draw two politics
D	mm
C	but you have to discard a card to come up here
D	do you choose the card?
C	no you choose
D	oh so I can choose right I'm gonna go to
C	you're gonna discard?
D	I'm gonna take it into politics
C	going to go up here and you're gonna get two politics cards?
D	yeah
C	there you are
D	I'm gonna discard one of these
C	okay put it in whichever pile
B	which colour is it?
D	er it erm
C	green
A	conveniently not one of the ones you'd need to put me in the Brig
D	no and I take
C	well he's moved up here anyway
D	I I take a crisis card do I?
C	so yeah you get a crisis card
D	read that crisis er minion
A	riots this'll be right down your alley
A	er you have the choice between minus one food and minus one morale or minus one population and minus one fuel so they're both bad
C	so the admiral gets that choice
D	minus what was the choice again? minus one fuel
C	so do you wanna minus one food and minus one morale?
D	yeah
C	or minus one population and minus one fuel? so either food and morale
D	yeah
C	or population and fuel
A	fuel's
C	yeah
D	what's the
C	so is population so I'd say go for food and morale
D	yeah
C	are you happy to do that?
D	yeah
C	okay morale food cool and basestar releases raiders three raiders come on cool
A	what happened to all our ships by the way?
C	they got put back here when we jumped
D	er when yeah we jumped
A	no but the other
C	the civilians?
A	yeah
C	yeah they get put back when we jump
A	but we didn't have any left
C	pardon?
A	we didn't have any
C	what do you mean we did have any?
A	oh they get put back when do we
C	when you see the card that's like attack and it tells you to set up they get put back on the board with the basestar
B	right
C	what do you need?
B	three
D	you'd only get that on the crisis
B	erm three yellow and two green please
C	three yellow and two green
B	oh sorry
C	oh not at all and where might you like to move?
B	that's all I've got now where would I like to move? I've only got one green oh no I haven't sorry
C	you got it?
B	it's stuck okay where would I like to move?
C	so we're not too far from jumping I guess you could attack one of these if you wanted to
A	might be against what she wants
C	yeah if she's a Cylon
A	I think so
A	I think you're all Cylons
B	I think I'll go to communication
C	how is that possible?
C	go to communication cool so this one allows you to look at the back of these two but we don't have any on the board
B	yeah so
C	you don't have to do that action you just move there
B	yeah
C	now which action would you like to do?
A	could do one of your special cards
C	yeah you could do one of your quorum cards
B	yeah okay
C	and Roslin can always pick up a quorum card as an action if she wants to
A	hoard them
C	yeah
D	mm how far have we jumped?
B	that one
C	only three okay
C	you're giving it to me oh no okay cool so
B	yeah?
C	it says destroy three raiders that's these three
B	yeah
C	or one heavy raider or one centurion token but we don't have any centurion tokens
B	no
C	so do you wanna destroy three of these or one of these?
B	which is better?
D	three raiders I should imagine
B	yeah
B	yeah okay
C	yeah nice work they're difficult to get rid of okay ah it says then you roll a die
B	yeah
C	and if two or less lose a population so if you get a one or a two we lose a population
B	yeah
C	nice we're good okay so that quorum card is discarded
B	okay
C	cool crisis card
A	not
C	pardon?
A	not sure
C	no
A	why would she've done that if she wasn't for?
C	I know it was positive in our favour wasn't it?
D	mm
C	misdirection
D	mm
C	I think you saw dad's card
A	no I didn't see that one
D	mm
C	oh
A	I only saw these little cards
A	which is why I knew I could get him in the Brig or I thought I could
D	mm
A	but no
C	erm which crises card do you choose?
B	yeah
C	legendary discovery if we pass this one we get one more point on this thing so we're at three and if we win this we go up to four
D	okay
C	so this adds another one to our distance but it's power of fourteen
B	yeah
C	and it's purple and red
B	right
D	so we gotta get
B	yeah
C	which are pretty difficult
B	yes
C	because none of us chose characters
B	so it's better to discard that one I think
A	I can make a good contribution to that
C	and if we fail it
D	what's it? purple and red?
C	yeah if we fail it we
D	fourteen
C	I have one crisis card
B	so I don't think er that's one I'll just discard then and this is the one
C	so you're not doing that one? okay
B	we're not gonna do that we're gonna do that
C	right so this one power of nine yellow and green raiders move round no jump pass no effect fail minus one morale and the current player looks at one random loyalty card if you fail you get to look at a loyalty card so you if you're a Cylon might want us to fail I don't know
D	mm
C	or we can just take the or here everyone discards two skill cards
D	take a vote?
A	right so let me have a look
C	so we can either vote to the power of nine yellow and green or
D	what colours?
C	yellow and green
A	right so if someone was a Cylon they'd wanna play the game and then they'd want it a low number
C	yeah
A	right
D	I can add a contribution erm what's the
C	I can pull my weight
D	what's the number we're aiming for?
B	nine
C	nine
A	when can I use this?
C	now
A	I'm gonna use that
C	so you can say so
D	okay
B	mm
C	so we see the cards being dealt out
D	okay are we going for it then?
C	so a Cylon can't do anything shifty or
D	okay there's four
C	so we're at
B	what do we need?
C	this
A	okay
C	so we're at
D	that's four we're trying to get nine
C	we need nine
C	nice so that's
B	eight
D	eight
C	eight how much can you help
A	I can't help
C	can't help at all?
A	no
C	okay that would've been
A	good
C	yeah
D	right
C	we did it so
A	that card made everyone play their like
C	yeah
C	so yeah you can do that one to show it up there's another one an engineering card a blue one that says where is it? oh they're all the same this one says play before the skill check and now all blue helps so anyone can lay a blue colour or if you pull one of these
A	oh no
D	oh we didn't know what the
C	they were both for
D	four plus? or?
D	yes
C	yeah that's good
D	yeah
C	okay so whose go is it now?
D	that was
B	yeah
C	it was
B	yeah
C	right I need to choose my cards one yellow two green two blue grab us two blue thank you very much okay I'm gonna still can't jump so I'm gonna attack this basestar roll the die seven is damaged now it can't release raiders so it can't shoot any more of these out
D	mm
C	so I crippled its raider producing capability cool and I do a crisis ugh
D	there's no point in destroying that really because it's it's has no function does it?
C	it's been
D	it's been er
C	it can still attack us
D	it's been
A	yeah
C	okay power of ten purple red and blue
D	and what's the bonus for this?
C	no effect if we pass if we fail we lose a raptor
D	so er
C	and we place a basestar in front of Galactica and two civilian ships behind it if we fail
D	right
C	so we don't really wanna do that can anyone help?
D	so what's the
C	purple red and blue
B	no I can't help at all
D	I can
A	is there no or?
C	no can you
D	I can help reasonably well
A	I can
C	ten
A	ten I can help well
C	you can help well
A	it'll be all my cards
C	I can help a good deal more than my weight maybe yeah more than my weight
A	well I'll help reasonably then
C	okay go on then put it in but don't look
B	no
C	don't wanna sabotage?
A	ten
C	four five ten twelve fourteen nineteen woah
A	wow
C	caned that one
D	mm
C	twenty-three
D	mm
A	so I'm a bit confused who is the Cylon now
C	yeah
D	mm
C	we'll find out in the next round I think it'll make it happen right
A	okay can I get er a purple and two red? and a green and a yellow
D	you've quite a
A	yeah
C	yeah you get many colours don't you?
A	mm
C	you only get two
C	right your move
D	what's your action?
A	Brig
D	what's your move? and then what's your action?
A	big time
A	no er I'm not gonna try that again
D	mm
A	er right
C	you should put him in the Brig
A	no
B	put your brother in the Brig
A	no
C	you think I'm the Cylon?
D	he thinks he thinks for some reason I am
C	I think
A	right I wanna get a tactics card cool please
C	rubbish
A	I take it that was my action of drawing a card?
C	yeah and you moved to that area
D	erm just for clarification is that yellow?
C	yeah yeah
D	right okay
B	politics
D	yeah
D	so I can help reasonably well
D	is it ten? oh we have to?
A	yeah there's no or on this one
D	oh right
C	no there's no or so the first thing happens it releases a heavy raider
B	ah I just got rid of that
A	right let me
C	yeah you did
A	you don't wanna fail this one cos it means I can put you in the sickbay
D	right
C	I'm not sure if it can release a heavy
B	I need a coffee
D	yes
B	it's your turn
A	shall we have a drink?
D	yeah
C	ah no heavy raiders
C	we go up one on the jump track
D	okay I'm just going to make a drink does anyone
B	oh let's let everybody finish this go hang on
C	so power of ten
B	and what colours?

D	I can help moderately
C	okay
B	a fair bit I would say
D	well
C	a fair bit? yeah?
D	mm
B	depending on what
C	are you sabotaging yourself?
B	mm
D	that should get us a favourable result
C	is he playing as a Cylon even though he's not just to mess with us?
D	could he have
C	is that what you're doing?
D	could he have picked up er since you checked him er er er that he is a Cylon
C	no no no we haven't had an
D	right
C	it hasn't happened somebody else is definitely about to become a Cylon in a moment oh what are these ones? they're my cards are they?
A	did you put any wild cards in?
C	oh minus two yeah I did one we've got a power of one we've got a power of zero minus three minus four
B	what was the point of that?
A	it wasn't just me I didn't put that many cards in

D	you put a whole bunch of cards in
B	you put a fistful in there
D	no I put I put two I know I put two cards in
B	I only put two in
C	I know which were the ones that you put in on this side cos I I
B	what was the point?
A	and the current player chooses a character and moves him to sickbay dad you're going to sickbay
C	oh so
B	on purpose yeah I knew it was it was him
C	to send you to sickbay
D	right okay
C	nice move
D	er sickbay is
A	it was a worthy sacrifice
D	oh I'm over there?
C	you're over there so discard a skill card cos you changed ship
C	well there you go

B	yeah
C	yeah yeah

B	no he cheats
C	does he?
B	oh he's a terrible cheat
C	oh that's terrible
C	I hear that you're a terrible cheater
D	what's that?
C	you
D	only when I understand the game
C	you seem to have picked it up pretty quick
D	until I understand the game but there's no cheating with erm there's no cheating in this there's no there's no erm
C	no you can't really can you?
D	you can't cheat no games like Scrabble you can cheat
C	we're playing we're playing

D	mm mm
C	oh you got your Bourbons
D	take them through
C	let me take them through
D	start erm boiling
C	ah these are
D	are you having water?
C	yeah
D	you don't wanna drink or anything?
C	no water's fine unless you're having one
D	no no I won't have one
C	might take him a while to pick it up
D	especially I've got a slight inside edge I've I've watched it if they've never watched it they wouldn't have a clue about what in the hell's going on
C	it follows it pretty closely doesn't it? so
D	yes they
C	there are actually three expansions so we've got the main game now for every expansion you get another little board that attaches to it
D	oh good lord
C	and each
D	right
C	the next expansion is season two
D	oh I see right
C	season three and season four
D	yeah

C	how do you make your hot chocolate?
D	with chocolate
C	do you make it with milk?
D	no with with water
C	oh
[ANNOTATION]	You need milk to make a hot chocolate.	Contradiction
C	I like it with milk
C	can I have one with milk?
D	sorry?
C	can I have one with milk?
D	well you'll have to put it in the microwave
C	is that the only way of heating up the milk?
C	can I do it on a pan?
D	er
C	or is that not nice?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C likes having croissants with hot chocolate.	Neutral
D	yeah just
C	what what are you having to drink?
D	I'm having hot chocolate but I'm having it not with the
C	do you mind if I do?
D	no I mean it's quite it probably is quicker to have it in the microwave cos it'll be about two minutes on full power
C	okay do whatever you normally do
C	do what you normally do whatever it is that normally gets done
D	right so I'll see you in there then
C	yeah okay
C	you need the water
C	oh bless you you look so cold
B	I'm freezing are you not cold?
C	I'm okay I'm not too bad
A	I was a little bit cold

A	I know I don't usually but while playing a board game it's
C	there's milk in this
A	I know
B	are
A	possibly actually I don't think there is
[ANNOTATION]	Their favourite board game is cluedo.	Neutral
A	oh my god
C	there's chocolate in there
A	apparently not it says just wheat flour
C	no actual chocolate in there?
A	no
C	bit of cocoa powder maybe
A	I've not seen any cocoa powder yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B used all the cocoa powder to bake a cake.	Neutral
B	what's? what are you doing in the microwave?
A	oh not suitable for milk allergy suffers sufferers
C	he says after wolfing down four
B	contains milk four biscuits or so
A	mm
C	whatever yeah when it goes in your favour
B	mm
C	in the microwave everyone seems to have picked it up
B	mm I couldn't do it without your help
A	no
B	cos I don't know which is a decent
A	I think it'll take quite a while to sabotage the game for the Cylon
C	every game plays out differently every single one
A	I can imagine like when you get er a bunch of people that are skilled at it like it'd get quite fun to try and
C	yeah
A	if like you're the Cylon
C	mm it's quite good yeah
B	how many people can play at one time?
C	six erm up to six people I've played it with six once
A	is his hearing going?
C	he's losing his faculties
B	is that
A	is the clock?
B	mm no it's not is it?
C	can't hear it
B	no you'd hear it
C	no has it run out of battery?
B	no it doesn't have batteries
C	oh
B	the wheel inside it's got quite I just hope he's recording my programme
C	oh you wind it
B	mm
C	wow
B	I love the sound of a clock
C	what? the winding sound?
B	no the tick-tock
C	oh the ticking yeah
B	yeah my clock in the hall plays the erm Westminster chime
C	yeah I know
B	your dad can't sleep so we can't have that
A	oh bashed my knee
C	oh
A	yeah
C	this one ticks really fast as well
A	mm
C	I never used to like a ticking clock when I was
B	don't you?
C	I could sleep with it but it becomes so noisy when it's like the only thing that's happening
B	I love it yeah and it brings back childhood memories
C	yeah
B	my grandmother had a clock that ticked she had a cuckoo clock as well cuckoo cuckoo
C	oh a proper cuckoo clock? yeah
B	proper cuckoo clock
C	how often would that go off at night?
B	erm think it only did the chime of the hour
C	but like through the night it would do that?
B	oh yeah
C	can you sleep through that?
B	mm
C	why would you want that going off through the night? I don't really understand the purpose
B	well you can't stop a clock can you?
C	no
B	you can't
C	mm
B	and she set stops hers at ten o'clock at night cos it's a pendulum
A	ginger mm
B	thank you
C	oh thank you very much oh that's hot
B	he did it in that cup
C	ah
B	if you're putting it on there can you put it on a mat please? cos that's hot
C	yeah I came very close to dropping this
B	thank you
C	so whose go was it?
B	dad's
A	it's dad's
C	it's dad's go
D	it's mine
B	why have you got two cups?
D	cos
B	mm I
A	oh
D	no
C	so if we jump one more time we go to the second phase where there's a sleeper so that can mean there's two Cylons
D	yeah
C	unless we get one of these down into the red before that happens and then there's only one Cylon
B	mm
D	can you pass us the mats
C	how many do you need?
D	just one
D	thank you
B	don't knock it
C	got it alright?
D	yeah right I got no erm tokens I need to pick up three and two don't I? is that right? was I put in the Brig? was I put somewhere er by someone?
C	yeah you you're in sickbay
D	so does what does that mean?
A	I put you in there
C	you can only get one skill card during your received skill set so choose one
A	and I don't think you can do any actions
C	and choose wisely
D	and no actions?
C	no he can
A	ah no
C	he's only in sickbay
A	why did I bother putting him in there then?
C	you used a lot of stuff for that
D	actions right erm
C	yeah well you can move and you can take an action so you still basically
A	better than nothing
D	could I move back there?
C	okay but you have to discard a skill card
D	oh right but
B	have you got any?
D	I've got one
C	if you move anywhere here you're okay if you move on here
D	right well er I can go in the command area can't I?
C	yeah you can activate two vipers
D	would that be a good idea to do that or not?
C	we're about to jump
D	no is the answer to that question
C	so maybe not
A	where are you hiding the Bourbons?
C	you've already eaten the other pack
A	there was only four in there
C	only four
D	he'll go through the whole lot
C	he's gonna be on the toilet
B	he won't go through the whole lot they're the biscuits for the week
B	you're like your father
D	no he's actually worse
B	he can't be
A	I may be worse
C	you will you'll be on the toilet in about half an hour my stomach
B	yeah I was gonna say he doesn't normally I don't know the last time he ate a biscuit doesn't have anything
D	what's this one?
C	that one's to put someone in the Brig
D	what's the front one?
C	does he not normally eat biscuits then?
D	ah I can potentially get a
C	what? to jump?
D	yeah
C	if you're a Cylon you might wanna do it and
D	okay what's the actions to that one?
C	shoot er a heavy raider but there aren't any?
D	can we share?
C	yeah
D	what's this one?
C	that one's where you pick up a tactics
C	or this has moved tactics or engineering so you can pick up
D	mm
C	cool right draw a crisis card
A	do you want me to read it?
D	mm
A	food shortage er this is for the president you've got the choice of er minus two food or minus one food and you have to discard two skill cards and the current player loses three so you need to make that decision
C	two food or one food?
A	mm how much food have we got? six so that would put us in the red
C	yeah we don't wanna
[ANNOTATION]	There is only one president in the card game.	Neutral
B	we don't do that then do we?
A	I dunno it could be fun to have another Cylon
C	it's better for the Cylons to have two Cylons
D	mm
A	yeah
B	doesn't really help
A	but if we lose one though we'll still be in we'll not be in the red
D	mm
B	won't we?
C	but we don't really wanna be in the red either cos it's you're close to dying if you lose any of those
A	yeah
C	so there's a fine balance
B	yeah I think we'll do
[ANNOTATION]	Being in the red area is not really good if one wants to win.	Entailment
C	can't remember the last time I had hot chocolate
D	mm
B	minus one food
C	minus one food
B	and then the president discards two and the player discards three
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C loves white chocolate.	Neutral
C	so who was the player was that you dad?
D	that was me unfortunately
C	so you've gotta discard three skill cards
B	yeah
D	I don't have three to discard
C	you have two so get rid of those two
D	right
B	and I've got to get rid of two as well
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D has less than 4 cards.	Entailment
C	yeah
B	there you go and have you gotta do this bit at the bottom?
C	yes okay so we go up one the jump track nice and raiders move around
B	that's my two cards gone then
C	cool and then
B	can I have them back now please? cos I'll have three yellow and two green please
C	three yellow
B	okay thank you
C	you could jump us now
B	so what does that mean?
[ANNOTATION]	There are also brown cards in the game.	Neutral
D	jump
C	so you know we're trying to to get further?
B	yeah
C	you could help us to get further
B	right
C	my prematurely jumping us
B	right
[ANNOTATION]	The aim of the game is not to go far away.	Contradiction
C	now if we wait till one more of these markers if we get one more of these
B	yeah
C	then we'll just jump on our own anyway
B	right
C	but you could take a risk and risk one population and jump early so jump now
B	and is that an advantage do you think?
D	er
C	we're not in any danger
D	we're not in any danger no they're that's immobilised
B	right so we might as well stay where we are
D	yeah
B	so er an action
C	but saying that there is a you do wanna get there as fast as possible because these cards just keep hammering away at your things
D	yes at your
C	so you don't wanna hang around too long
D	no
C	we've already been hanging around for quite a while
D	you wanna yes you wanna shorten the journey don't you?
C	yeah
D	that's what your trying to do
A	I swear I haven't had a hot chocolate in like
D	mm
A	eight years or something
D	mm
A	ten years
D	mm
B	right my action's gonna be this one
C	okay
B	going to draw
C	so you draw two skill cards of any type
B	yeah
C	that can come out of your skill set that's a pretty good card
B	yeah so I'm going to have a red and a purple
C	nice
B	thank you can I have one of those horrible things? or two?
C	yeah two of the horrible oh sorry
B	thank you
C	of the horrible crisis cards
B	sorry? oh
A	not sure possibly dad
C	still dad?
A	yeah
C	I mean I think
A	I don't know it's not you
D	no you don't know it's not him either
C	I do know that it's not me
A	be interesting
D	mm
C	oh excuse me
B	fighting power you put in that stuff didn't you?
D	mm
D	mm
B	I'll discard that one
C	okay
B	and play that one
D	hope you don't do that when you're teaching your students
C	no
A	it'd be quite interesting to
C	just let a very
D	mm
C	see them all like
C	power of eleven so regardless of this these move but kind of at the same time as they move we jump so they don't actually move
A	they're gone
C	nice one
D	er but doesn't that come back on again?
C	erm yes yeah we said that
D	which actually potentially makes it more dangerous than it was
C	yeah
D	cos it was immobilised
C	yeah it was immobilised oh interesting if we pass we increase the jump by one that's good if we fail we minus a population and place one centurion marker here so that's not good don't want that to happen or we can minus a population and decrease the jump prep by one what would you like to do? do you wanna vote or do you wanna do the or
B	what colours can we use? yellow purple and blue
D	we can't help in any
C	I can pull my weight definitely more than my weight
A	what colours?
C	purple yellow and blue
A	and green
B	I can't help and green?
C	there's no green
B	that's blue
A	oh is that blue?
D	can't see
A	yeah it's blue I can't help
B	I can't hardly help either
D	mm
C	er oh
A	I can barely help
C	dad you can't help?
D	I don't have any cards
C	well we don't wanna minus a population and place one centurion marker at the start of the boarding party do we?
D	so what's the alternative?
C	we minus a population and decrease the jump track by one we can't decrease any more anyway
D	we can't decrease it so we just lose one
C	so we just minus a population
D	yeah that's the er the obvious
C	so are we doing that?
D	yeah
B	uhu
D	you've got no choice really have you?
C	decrease in population right and now we jumped so dad you choose two of these
D	right and it's one of them isn't it?
B	can I give you that card? no cos it's not my turn is it?
C	no it's not your turn
C	should've given it to me earlier on another round and then I could've chosen not then
B	so can I give it to you any
C	as an action
B	yes
C	yeah
B	oh right
C	yeah when it's your action then you can give it to
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has run out of cards.	Contradiction
B	yeah when it's mine
C	he studies them very intensely doesn't he?
C	interesting that you're Apollo
A	I know
C	his son
C	in the TV show
D	of er of Adama
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C mentions that someone is Athena.	Contradiction
B	mm
C	and actually you're his missus
B	oh
D	his squeeze
C	yeah
C	they're they're very close she's very unwell and he looks after her and I'm just someone random
C	just the Chief
D	right I'm gonna go for this option
C	okay
D	lose one fuel the admiral may risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher gain one food otherwise destroy one raptor
C	okay
D	so basically I've gotta
[ANNOTATION]	There are no dice in this card game.	Contradiction
C	risk a raptor roll a die what do you have to roll?
D	erm gotta lose one fuel have we lost that?
C	yeah just did it
D	right I've gotta get three or higher otherwise we destroy
C	go on then
D	er the that raptor
C	roll a die
D	it's gotta be three or higher
C	yeah nice so what happened?
D	it just says lose one fuel the admiral may risk one raptor to roll a die if three or higher gain oh sorry gain one food
C	nice so we gain a food but now we enter the sleeper phase and we're not in the red or anything so there's definitely gonna be two Cylons in the game
[ANNOTATION]	The players begin the thunder phase.	Contradiction
D	why are we in?
A	so we've reached four
C	so we've reached
C	oh what was the card you gave us?
A	it was one
C	where is it?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C gave a card that was less than 5.	Entailment
D	it's a it's a one
A	oh he's definitely a Cylon isn't he?
C	he's not taken us very far at all
D	right
C	cos we've got a total of four we're trying to get eight
[ANNOTATION]	The players attempt to reach 6.	Contradiction
D	right
C	and we've got four so now we each get a loyalty card again don't show it to anyone it's secret okay?
C	and have a look at your card okay if you're a Cylon now you can choose to play the game covertly and nobody knows or you can reveal yourself when it's your turn get a super crisis card do a special ability that's on your card your reader and then go to this area if you're like me a sympathiser this is a different card you either you're er are a Cylon you are not a Cylon you're a sympathiser which is what I just picked up I have to reveal myself immediately and I erm you are not er you do not receive a super crisis card and may not activate the Cylon fleet location so I reveal
D	what happens if you pick that up if you
C	I can give this there's a thing here that allows me to give a card to somebody I can give a loyalty card
D	mm
D	right
C	so you can give one to somebody else so I'm a Cylon yay
D	or you're a Cylon sympathiser
C	yeah so who was I I go to this now I resurrect the resurrection ship I have to discard down to three cards I've only got three anyway now when it comes to voting
D	can you be turned again or not?
C	no now when it comes to voting I can only put one card in
D	right
C	I can't put more than one card in
D	right
C	and I only can only pick up two cards but I can pick up any two cards now when I play
D	right
C	and I don't get a super crisis card because I wasn't a revealed Cylon I'm a sympathiser
D	yeah
C	okay cool
D	right
C	so whose go is it now?
D	must be
C	no no it was just your go wasn't it?
B	yes it was your go cos you gave
D	oh er cos the yes
B	so it's my turn
D	it's time to reveal your hand
B	right
C	I'm a Cylon but I could've already been a Cylon
D	yes
C	so I could potentially give somebody else the Cylon
B	you'd be a double Cylon
D	mm
C	yeah
B	erm right can I have three yellow and two green to start off with please?
C	course you can
B	thank you
C	there you are
D	was I er I wasn't supposed to pick up any cards was I?
C	no you're in the sickbay I think
D	am I? oh yes I am
C	you were you're not now it's very noisy isn't it?
D	mm
A	it sounds like it's going faster than once a second
C	mm
D	mm
C	every two clicks is a second isn't it?
A	yeah
B	right I'll play this one choose any other player you may move his character and then take one action or not move and take two actions limit of one per turn okay
C	who do you choose?
C	yeah?
A	cool
C	so you get another two goes
A	okay
D	is it me or has it warmed up a bit?
C	yeah
B	it's you cos you had a hot drink
A	it's probably the hot drinks
D	mm
C	purple and?
A	yellow
C	purple and yellow god am I the only Cylon? somebody out here needs to help me
A	thank you
D	mm
C	okay and you still get another move another action
C	cool
A	er this time red two reds
C	nice
A	thank you
B	right that's mine I've played
C	okay
B	and now I need one of the
C	so you get your two crisis
B	cards that's right
C	what was your special ability? so once per game
B	right
C	as your special ability skilled politician choose one to resolve and then place the rest on the bottom of the deck so you can do that once per game as your action if you want to
B	okay
C	everyone's got a special
D	I can launch the nukes
C	mm there's not much attacking us at the minute
D	no
B	these are awful
C	we may not get to the end of this game we're only halfway
D	no I don't think so what time is it now?
C	I told you it takes quite a while to play it out doesn't it?
D	mm we'll go to a quarter past ten and then we'll
C	yeah
D	call it a draw
C	well if anyone is a Cylon I suggest you reveal
D	mm
C	so that we can er
D	well before quarter past ten yeah
C	well like soon so that we can try and damage them a bit before quarter past ten
B	well I can't do that one because it there's no that's not available so it'll have to be that one I'll have to play that cos I can't do that one
C	you can do that one
B	how can you? there's nothing on the board
C	it adds it that adds stuff to the board so
B	oh right
C	you probably don't wanna do that one
D	if you were a Cylon you'd want you'd wanna play that if you were Cylon Cylon
C	if you were a Cylon you'd wanna do that yeah are you a Cylon? would you wanna do this?
B	I'm not telling you what I am but I'm not gonna play that one I'd rather play that one
C	okay
D	right
C	so yeah if you are a Cylon you wanna add stuff to the board
D	mm ordnance
C	okay so we need a ten purple red blue
D	er no cards
C	no effect this one releases this
A	yeah
B	what colour? purple
C	purple red and blue
A	purple red and blue
D	I cannot help
B	I can help a little bit but not a lot
C	okay so is that everyone? I'll lay mine down I can only put one cos I'm a Cylon still need to shuffle a little bit because we don't know who there's still one more minus two minus four minus one zero one minus one three
B	so we failed?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	and two of these vipers get damaged so they can't be
D	mm which you're not gonna do are you?
C	no okay
B	yep
D	mm
C	we don't do the thing this one is the admiral chooses minus two food sorry president chooses minus two food or minus one food and you discard two skill cards and I discard three
D	have you got three to discard?
B	yeah he has
D	well I know which one I'd
C	no
B	hello?
D	tell em we're busy er jumping to hyperspace
B	yes thank you and you? that's good
A	is it my go?
C	yeah it is your go
A	I'm a Cylon
C	right is he revealing?
C	yeah yeah
D	I knew it all
D	all along that you were
C	he couldn't've been before
D	no
A	no
C	right so
A	yep
C	so you
D	so what that thought about me being one was a load of rubbish wasn't it?
A	you could still be one
B	mm
C	no he can't any more there's the two of us now
D	yeah yeah
C	so nobody was one at the beginning
D	no
B	no
C	no no one was a Cylon
D	well I don't know it wasn't me
D	especially
D	unless I'm so good at er sleight of sleight of hand
A	were you always a sympathiser?
C	no no I've just recently got the sympathiser card
A	so who started as a Cylon?
B	so
C	you only get the sympathiser card halfway through nobody no one was a Cylon
D	either or well er
A	how do you know that?
C	because you there
D	yes
C	for a four player game
D	actually we
C	for a five player game you put in two
D	were
B	well I knew
D	yes you knew that but I didn't know that but I never
A	I was pretty sure you were dad
D	I know but I didn't defend or er I didn't deny or
A	you were quite sure he was as well
C	yeah I thought er dad was
D	I didn't say a
C	no but but that
D	but I didn't make any
C	that made it seem suspicious that you weren't doing anything so
D	yes yes
A	mm
C	yeah so we both became Cylons in the second round
D	thing is in in another game of this you wouldn't know which one I was because like you said I have given no impression either way
D	yes
C	I think I made a mistake once but
D	mm
C	it was definitely like two or three times when that happened
A	right so what
C	right so you discard down to three skill cards
A	yep
C	then you lose your title so if you have the presidency or the admiralty you lose that so
D	mm
C	you don't you resurrect so Apollo is a Cylon
D	mm
C	on the resurrection ship you receive a super crisis card okay super crisis card use it wisely erm and you end your turn
C	or you do short ones that are not as damaging
D	yeah
C	like the three is like destroy three fuel or something
D	yeah
C	it's not particularly
D	erm
C	but they've definitely got three more jumps even if they got a three they still need one more to make a four and then you always have to do one more jump after you make eight so they've definitely got three more jumps
D	mm
C	so you can hold this card back and you know when we do a skill check and you have to vote?
C	and every one bids different amounts at the end of it you can go oh we didn't make it by two and then add this card and we made it
D	right
C	cos it reduces the the difficulty by two
C	but you use it after this you wait and see
D	yes it's post rather than
C	yeah
D	there you go
C	but you guys are gonna find it hard now to vote because there's only two of you to
D	yes
C	beat the skill check
D	yes
C	and there's two of us to put in against you you really didn't want two Cylon's against you it's much much harder
D	no no no
D	especially when you're you're you you've played it before
B	you've played and we haven't
D	yeah
C	are you comfy there?
A	I am
C	yeah?
A	there was a chair there
C	yeah there is it's quite far away I'm used to sitting on the floor we always play this game on the floor so
D	you've played this a few times?
C	yeah we've probably played it like ten times
D	yeah so you're quite good at this
C	mm
A	that's like thirty hours
A	you've played it for quite a while
C	we've played Game of Thrones even more
D	weapons control
A	you've got that as well?
D	what does weapons control give me?
C	you can attack this or you can attack that you can
D	with er without using my my?
C	yeah without using your nuke
D	how many throws do I need to to blow that out?
C	so with Galactica five to eight just damages it that's all if you get five to eight you damage it
D	how many rolls have I got?
C	only one
D	so I'm only gonna damage it with
C	yeah you've gotta shoot it with the base with the Battlestar
D	oh well might as well try that
C	five to eight nice
D	no yeah
C	so you damaged it
D	a seven yep
C	so which one? one two three or four?
D	are they all got something something different on em?
C	yeah
D	go for that one
C	damaged it twice
D	right
D	so it needs one more hit doesn't it?
C	yeah one more hit cool so now you get a crisis
D	right
C	this is where dad struggles to read it
D	mm activate the erm vipers by the looks of it
C	shall we have a look? oh wow yeah you've got another one of these so every time you see one of these blue cards where like something attacks you?
D	yeah
C	that's that's kind of bad
B	mm
C	activate the vipers you don't have any vipers so this thing releases vipers
D	mm
C	you get three of those set out one basestar
D	brilliant
C	two vipers yeah and four civilian ships
D	and they don't go in the back?
C	no you get one like that
D	oh right in each quadrant?
C	yep
D	okay
C	okay and erm special rule
D	these go round are these going round this way?
B	no they're going this way that thing is
D	well this thing is going round that way
B	yeah
D	but the
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	basestars are going round that way aren't they?
B	yeah
C	yeah the the basestars don't really move but these things go round
D	okay right okay
C	cool
B	right
D	right
B	my turn yeah?
C	yes yeah it's your turn
B	right erm
C	did you go up one on the jump? or no you didn't do anything like that
D	no
D	didn't have a jump sign on it
C	no
B	okay could I have my three yellow and two green?
A	yeah
C	yep
B	then I decide what I'm going to do
C	I haven't got many cards bro how are you doing?
A	I don't have many either it's a strong one though
B	oh right
C	so you can do this go and then you can't have more than ten
C	okay
B	so I've got to get rid of one now
C	no you can take your go first so you could use some cards in your go and then you don't have to
D	mm
B	yeah right okay
C	oh
D	mm
C	it's nice having a double bed to myself
D	mm
C	you've got a double bed haven't you?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I'll be downgrading when I go though
D	you just leave the double bed there don't you?
C	to a very small
A	mm
C	student room
A	yeah
C	at an exorbitant price
A	yeah it'd take me too long to dismantle that bed
B	I'm gonna do this one as my action
D	no but but by doing that you're
C	what was your action
A	yeah
D	you where this is you've still got your bedroom
A	yeah that's true
B	choose any other player he may move his character and then take one action or not move and take two action cards
C	okay
C	right so she's given you two actions or a movement and an action
D	right choose any other player he may move his character and then take one action or not move and take two actions
A	so that's you
B	that's
C	so dad you can either take two actions or you can move and take an action
D	take two actions well we might as well have another pop at pop at that erm basestar
C	you're gonna tackle em again? now might be a good time to nuke there's a couple of them on there
D	yes so well if I
C	you could nuke this one
D	yeah so what do I do? put it on this?
C	roll a die
D	and what right
C	gotta roll a die
D	and what what?
C	what's the score?
D	what do I? I dunno
C	well you want a
D	I've got play any die roll to add two to the result so I could get a six
C	but you've gotta play that card before you roll
D	have I?
C	yeah
D	oh okay
C	you can't play it after
D	I'm gonna chance it
C	okay
D	nowhere near
C	oh
D	nowhere near
C	did you get a two?
D	no I
C	oh
D	I didn't even ping it
C	so you get four but that's alright you still destroyed it
D	did I?
C	yeah so it was a one to two was damage twice three to six was destroyed seven to eight was destroyed and three raiders in the area so you destroyed it
D	right so
C	do you wanna destroy this one or that one?
D	er that one
C	yeah cool er it's gone
D	and this will go
C	you've still got another action
D	right
D	oh er er what do I need to to destroy that now?
A	not a lot
C	you can attack with this again
D	that nuke's the what's this?
C	yeah go on
D	right I can just throw a dice and what
C	so you need a to damage this now with Galactica five to eight
D	I've already damaged it so it's got two
C	yeah but you've gotta damage it one more time it's already got two so five to eight
C	what did he get?
D	seven
C	seven so you pull a token it says it's damaged again so you damaged it three times and dad just took out two basestars
A	that was pretty good
B	good
C	pretty good yeah
D	do I need a crisis card?
B	two two
C	yeah
B	no does he?
B	yeah it's my turn
D	oh right you
B	I gave you that
D	oh yeah yeah that's right yeah
B	right we'll discard that one and we'll use the
C	sorry I missed you there yeah if you're the player president and the player you have to discard five
D	there's a there's a raptor at the bottom of that what does that mean?
B	and a whatsit thing to go up the ladder
C	so you've chosen this one?
B	yeah
D	oh there's one to go up the
C	so that goes up the
D	er
C	so which would you
B	how many food have we got? how much food?
D	we've got we've got five
C	five food
D	that'll take us down to three
D	or five can you lose five cards?
B	get rid of some of these cards then can't I? five cards
D	have you got five ones?
C	are you going for five cards?
B	hang on a minute one
D	have you got five ones?
B	one
D	or
C	you've got good card have you
B	two
C	so am I minusing a food?
B	three oh I don't really wanna lose these
D	then go for two food
B	yeah but we need the food don't we?
D	well we got oh you've taken one off already?
C	I've taken one off
D	that's put us into red is that?
C	yeah that's okay
B	I'll have to lose these how many have I got to lose?
C	five
B	five?
C	yeah
D	you don't have to you can just take us down to three in food and keep those cards
B	then I'll have to donate three I can't afford to lose these
C	yeah?
B	yeah
C	she's gonna right so we're taking another food down?
D	yeah
C	okay alright there we go oh we're getting there
D	right your go now
C	so is it my go? okay
B	they were two terrible cards
D	yeah they're all bad news
C	okay so I can erm I can look at any player's hand and steal one skill card so
B	thought you might
C	there you are and I'm gonna roll if we get a five or higher where's the die?
D	mm sixty percent chance
C	oh
B	good
D	right
C	so no damage
B	mm
B	what's your
A	erm red and purple
D	yeah you don't get a crisis card then do you?
C	no
C	no
A	no but I do have this
D	which is probably bad news
C	oh nice so
D	yeah what? so it's gonna be bad news
C	right so let's see what happens first thing that happens is activate heavy raider so that's one away from going in and also basestar attacks but there's no basestar so you were lucky you had two here
D	oh right okay
C	er you you destroyed them erm now we activate and we bring in two basestars so although you got rid of them they're back we bring in another heavy raider we bring in four raiders here
D	we need to jump
C	yeah you do you bring in two raptors and two civilian ships four civilian ships
C	two in each quadrant
D	it doesn't put the jump it doesn't put the jump
C	and also yeah it says and reduce the jump track by two
D	well we're we're
B	we're absolutely stuffed
D	we're screwed
B	how on earth did you manage to pick that up?
C	that's the most powerful card in the game basically
D	er is it oh is that the one most powerful? er er
C	yeah that is the most
D	that's er we we hit with the worst possible card in the game
B	er
C	so it only gets better from here on in
D	mm
B	you mean it can?
D	right so it's now my go again
B	mm
A	yeah
C	can actually when you play the game when you become a Cylon can be kinda quick because you just quickly do your move and then they have to think about what they're doing for quite a while so you kind of end up just
D	I've gotta use my other nuke and try and
C	quickly just do your good move
D	I've gotta use a nuke on er this one's actually more dangerous isn't it? than that one?
C	yeah I'd say so
D	er yes cos it's got er a heavy raptor and it's further round here
C	and it's also got this here
D	and it's got that in there so we're gonna
C	right do you have something to help with the die roll?
D	erm
B	what colour was that?
D	add
C	cool so
D	right
C	take a roll
D	and what do I need?
C	you look pleased with yourself
A	it was a good move
C	yeah
D	a six gives me eight
C	you got eight you caned it so you destroy this and these
D	how about the heavy raptor?
C	no you don't destroy them I'm afraid
D	right well that was a reasonable result
C	mm
D	and I've gotta pick up some cards
C	so your nuke's gone
A	dad used his nukes well
D	er erm I need another
B	mm
A	what? he's taken out a basestar?
C	yeah he's taken out a basestar and two raptors
B	what do you need?
D	another one of those
B	mm
C	two raiders as well but they've still got the heavy raiders here
A	mm
D	and I've gotta pick up a catastrophe card haven't I?
B	yeah
C	crisis card
D	yeah
D	same difference isn't it?
C	right basestar attacks is the first thing that happens so that's useful
D	it says fulfiller of prophecy the spell the
C	let's have a look? so the first thing the basestar attacks so do you wanna roll a die?
D	right er what do I need?
C	you the basestar's gonna attack
D	what am I attacking?
C	the Battlestar so
D	okay
C	four to eight damages it so you want one to three
D	I wanna low
C	yeah
C	no?
D	unfortunately that's a seven not a one
C	so choose one and what's damaged? so oh no
D	er don't tell me the whole thing's wiped out is it?
C	that's just fuel so you've just lost a fuel
D	oh right is is that good or bad for me?
C	well bad you lost a fuel right now you've gotta vote for six did you wanna do the or? or do you just wanna vote?
D	which is?
C	the or was you discard a skill card and then you draw a new crisis card and resolve it
D	no
C	or you vote for six yellow and green if you pass you draw one politics skill card if you fail you lose a population
D	and there's two of those cards go in don't they?
C	yeah
D	erm six yeah I can do that
B	yeah I can help you
D	is it er I can put all my cards in can't I? but but that's not so good
C	you can do as many as you want
D	no but you can help
B	yeah we only want eight don't we?
A	what colours do they need?
D	six or eight?
B	six
C	they need yellow and green so we wanna sabotage them
D	do we need six or eight? six?
B	six is that what it says? do we need six?
C	you need six yeah
B	yeah
C	but you gotta bear in mind now you're going against the destiny deck and you're going against
A	we can only put in one
D	right so we're gonna have to load it because they're gonna try and up so we don't know the destiny
B	no we don't do we?
D	have you how strongly can you help?
B	well I can
D	okay
B	make it good if you want me to
D	go on then yeah make it good
B	well what are you gonna do then?
D	I'm gonna do a
B	okay
D	and it's six we've got isn't it?
C	yeah
D	okay
C	nice they're putting in some strong cards
D	may not it may not be strong enough
C	I don't need to shuffle any more cos we know
D	it may not be strong enough
C	who the Cylons are so the cards you put in one zero minus three minus eight minus six minus three plus two plus four plus six plus seven
D	that's good enough
C	plus nine plus ten
D	that's good enough
B	I put eight in
C	you did it
D	right that's good enough
C	they did it
D	so what happens now then?
C	so now erm
D	do we stuff you?
C	you get a politics skill card
D	where's that from? oh one of those?
B	yeah
C	pah pah I thought we were gonna beat them then
A	mm
C	are you getting tired?
A	little bit
D	yeah we'll finish soon
C	yeah we can call it we don't have to play to the end
D	to the end we'd be
C	yeah I know
D	actually
C	yeah I reckon so
D	maybe
C	it's a bit late though isn't it? so
B	right
C	which cards do you get? three politics
B	three yellow and two green please
C	three yellow
B	thank you
C	someone's been burning something in here
D	yeah it's a fire it's an open fire
C	yeah no of course but like
C	cards or wrapping or
D	mm
C	paper looks like telephone numbers or something
B	go on then I'll play that you can go
C	oh she's given you more goes
B	well it'll stop you going the more times we go
C	yeah
B	the better
D	mm choose any other player
B	yeah
D	he may move his character and then take one action or not move and take two actions
D	I I'm not er I'm I'm not move and take two actions
B	hang on what does it say?
D	er no not move and take two actions
B	hang on wait a minute
C	lift up your top there is definitely a belly under there
D	yeah there's a belly under there yeah
C	oh
D	yeah
C	oh
B	ugh
C	we've got that on tape
D	fifty-five what do you expect?
D	right I'm gonna take I've got two actions I'm gonna take two pop shots at that
C	sorry?
B	mm
D	er I'm gonna take two pop shots at that
C	okay what with?
B	there we are
C	you can only take one oh no you can take two can't you?
D	I can take two yeah
C	nice go for it they're gonna destroy your attack
A	mm
C	but however there's er one here that activates anything you choose so you can come to this location and activate all the
D	right so
D	so I've got two throws the the are these two throws added together?
C	no no no just roll one
B	what's this? where's that come from? that was laying on the board
D	I've just played it play any before you roll
B	oh right yeah
B	mm right
C	so you need to get a erm three to eight to damage it
D	that
C	nice so you damage it
D	that's my
C	yeah you can't use it again
D	so that so that
C	right it can't produce any more raiders but you still gotta damage it twice more so you've got one more roll you've gotta get a
D	okay
C	so you damaged it once okay? my go
C	I'm kinda limited as a sympathiser there's certain things that I can't really do I can draw
B	but
C	yeah?
B	I haven't taken my whatsits
D	I haven't taken a crisis card
C	oh you haven't had your crisis card
B	so it's no no
C	sorry
D	yeah neither have I
B	you don't
C	it's not your go
B	no it's my turn
D	oh of course yeah yeah yeah yeah you just keep yeah keep keep pummelling
B	I'm just giving you an extra go so that you can keep giving us a chance to knock something out before they put some more on
D	pummelling them
B	oh
D	it's either bad news or
D	yeah
C	something terrible happens
D	yeah
C	deal with it
A	all the time
C	it's really just the game of the human's trying
B	right we'll pass on that one put that one away and we'll play this one
C	what was that one?
B	what was that one?
C	oh what's this one?
B	reinactivate the whole lot again
C	ah they all come back
B	yeah
C	so this one is power of ten pass no effect fail minus one population your population's getting low so you don't wanna do that
B	we ain't got no choice though have I? can't reactivate the
C	green or red and also the erm the raiders what does that one do? produces raiders or?
B	I had another two awful cards
C	launches raiders
B	and what are they? green or red did you say?
D	yeah
B	can you help much with this?
D	what?
B	green or red
D	I can help yeah with green
B	much?
D	reasonably
D	what's the score first? what's the er aim?
B	it's high
D	how high?
B	oh I dunno what it is
C	ten
B	ten?
D	oh I can do I can do seventy per cent of that
C	can you sabotage
C	that's a bit accurate isn't it?
A	what colour do they need?
C	er they need purple and red I believe
D	oh purple and red?
C	yeah
B	yeah
D	oh I thought it was green and
B	oh I thought it was green sorry
D	I thought it was green
B	and I thought it was green
D	oh no in that case no er not really
B	no I can't do anything either
D	no
C	oh dear
B	stuffed completely
C	so are you ready for the vote?
D	yeah we're gonna get screwed
C	erm who goes first? I go first?
D	mm
A	I've got nothing
C	yeah cool dad?
D	I've got nothing
B	I've got nothing
D	oh what
C	no?
D	er is it a colour? I've got to go
B	yeah you'd have to
C	you don't have to put anything if you don't want to
B	it's green
C	cos you may think you've just lost it anyway
D	it's green or?
B	no
C	no purple or red
B	no no purple and red
D	well you keep saying green and
B	sorry
D	erm no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna bother with
C	so that was equalled out oh yeah you lose you definitely lose so minus one population
A	can't really do anything at the moment
C	no?
B	played all his cards so that was the finish of my turn okay that card wants to go back
C	yeah it's my go
B	okay and it's your turn yep
C	right I'm gonna do two crisis cards again it's just these things keep
D	we don't actually be able to in a position to really er
C	yeah
D	what you're throwing against us
C	you are yeah we just keep attacking you
D	yes er we're just trying to get away and
C	it's hard when there's two Cylons against you we just keep attacking
D	yes
C	but we kinda have to wait as well as I said we take a quick go and then we're done so you don't wanna really reveal until quite late
A	mm
C	you could've maybe done another round or two before you
A	you told me to reveal
C	I suggested it
A	yeah
C	right erm I'm definitely going for this one so first thing that happens is this board boards
D	right
C	so you get a centurion marker on the board
D	that's the beginning of the end
C	yeah that's boarded second thing you go up the jump prep you need to get twelve yellow green and purple and it was my go so I should
D	I can do reasonably well on that
B	mm so can I
B	yeah
C	have you got any blues or reds?
A	I may do
C	something strong maybe?
D	we're gonna have to throw everything we
A	that's not particularly strong is it?
C	mine wasn't either right that's against
D	green what's it? what is it? green what?
B	green and yellow
C	green yellow and purple
D	right okay
C	we'll call it in five minutes shall we?
A	I'm all in
C	wow all in?
D	I'm all in
C	I think you got it four seven ten thirteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
A	mm
B	I told you not to put it all in
D	no but erm we didn't know what they had
B	well it doesn't matter I put more than they wanted to start off with to give you the chance to keep your cards oh you
D	oh good lord
D	right
B	you're a
D	not to worry
C	just
C	it's alright we're playing for the last round really aren't we?
D	erm what?
D	so you you you don't suffer anything for that do you?
C	no no no no you just survive
D	yeah
C	that's what happens
D	that's it's er we're either sort of we're either blocking or
A	we're attacking
A	right what can I do?
D	we're not gonna survive
C	oh and that raider moved around
A	sorry
D	we're not gonna
A	what can I do?
C	you can either erm draw two crises cards and choose one for them
A	yep
C	or you can activate any of the ships that you wanna do or you can look at their hand when you reveal by the way there should've been a super power on your card
A	yeah it was like something like put em in the Brig or something
C	did you not do it?
A	no
C	oh
D	he'd already tried that one and it wasn't really helpful
A	yeah
C	so yeah they're your three options
A	so I get to pick two crisis
C	yeah
D	mm
C	choose one
D	my advice go for the worst one
A	what happens if I get another centurion in? in
C	that's good that screws them up
D	I think we're kind of screwed already
C	yeah
A	alright I'm playing with this one
C	oh right so this one bloody hell there's a bit of an army going on this thing
D	erm I
C	quite a few that are coming after you pass no effect fail all characters
A	ah
D	oh
B	ah
C	are you alright?
A	it's okay yeah
