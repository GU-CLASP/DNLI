A	fifty-five they get
C	yeah
A	you know police and army

C	mm
B	well next door they retired at fifty
A	they were teachers were they?
B	yeah
C	mm
A	and they got whacking great pensions
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said  they got whacking great pensions	Entailment
B	well
C	yeah
B	deputy head
C	erm yeah I think so
A	yeah
B	both deputy heads
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	well so they was on a good wage weren't they?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	and they got seventy-five percent
A	yeah
C	seventy-five percent?
B	yeah then
A	but
C	wow
[ANNOTATION]	Person C is amazed by that percentage	Neutral
A	it's and it's erm in you know inflation
B	yeah
A	er protected innit?
B	yeah yeah inflation proof they got all that yes
C	mm
B	they had it good those
A	the amazing you know the amount this this this government spends
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said government pay for all of it	Neutral
B	yeah
A	public services
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	perhaps that's why they're getting rid of them or why
B	well yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think its right that they get rid of them	Neutral
A	cos they wouldn't have to worry about it when they're all privatised would they?
A	mm
B	that's not gonna cost them much either is it?
A	no
B	so they'll get rid of a load of army people won't they?
A	well they already have done haven't they?
B	well they have done loads yeah
A	yeah
B	but there's loads more to go now cos I mean
A	mm
B	they're more or less redundant now aren't they?
A	well they're always no they have a
B	they do yeah
A	several tens of thousands
B	but they
A	of people but you see for every soldier on the ground you need like ten people to
B	to cos you
A	to organise them
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	they just
A	but when you look at that and that Camp Bastion they built
C	mm
B	god
A	you know you've seen pictures of that on telly
C	mm
A	there's a town the size of Reading
B	yeah
A	and you
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	really?
A	and you think if they'd have spent that money in Britain
B	on hospitals
B	and schools
A	even on
C	yeah
A	repairing the roads and that
B	yeah yeah
A	but like you say hospitals where
C	yeah
A	hospitals out to private tender
B	they do yeah
A	and like for the Norfolk and Norwich hospital
B	mm
A	it's gonna cost over a billion pounds
B	yeah
A	by the time we've paid for it
B	yeah
A	for a hospital that cost two hundred million
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I mean
C	yeah the world's crazy
A	you know it's er they say it's the equivalent of
B	yeah that's right
A	that's the that's the amount of
C	you're paying in the
A	interest you're paying rather than like the three or four
B	paying them
A	percent
C	mm
B	yeah
A	thirty-five million a year aren't they?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B sure that it is thirty-five million a year	Entailment
A	for thirty-five years
B	yeah
C	mm
A	for something that only cost two hundred million
C	oh
A	in the first place
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	but they said they offset it by giving a load of money to Ireland and charging them Ireland and charging them a whole lot of interest didn't they?
A	oh right yeah
B	yeah
A	but
B	bail er Ireland out
A	yeah
B	and charge them I think they've charged them
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	but you know
B	six percent haven't they?
A	it's sort of like
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but two hundred million is absolutely
B	no it's chickenfeed to what they've been spending innit?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B believe that the gap is useful for him	Contradiction
A	mm
B	and what they're going to spent in the future anyway
A	that's right I remember someone when all this PFI stuff was coming out about
B	yeah
A	building hospitals and that and I was having this argument with someone and said well what you know the government could easily pay for that
B	of course they could
A	yeah and and they could create government bonds paying three percent to pay for it
B	yeah
A	whereas
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said they have to pay about three percent for government bounds	Neutral
B	that's right yeah
A	and rather than giving it these for and someone
B	they have
A	er pounds haven't they?
B	they have yeah
A	just made it out of nothing
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think they made money from nothing	Neutral
A	I mean they can
B	they
A	fish money out of fresh air can't they
B	of course they can
C	mm
A	it's amazing when you think about like
B	that is an er I mean they
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	and fivers
A	well it was only
C	mm
A	about ten years ago that people started talking in billions didn't they?
B	they did yeah
A	yeah and before that it was
C	yeah
A	millions and then suddenly
B	yeah
A	it was billions now everything's billions
B	well in in the year two thousand
A	mm
B	well that's a billion billion
A	a thousand billion
B	a thousand billion sorry a thousand
A	yeah yeah but it still is a it's a
B	yeah
A	a thousand
C	yeah
A	thousand million
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah a million million innit
B	and now it's gone up to one point
C	really?
B	six trillion or something like that
A	but they say but it doesn't matter you know
B	no it don't matter
A	cos you're never gonna have to pay it
B	no
B	so who was the
A	and if you had to pay it then you'd draw back
B	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	and which is probably our you know this national debt figure
B	by what we're
A	by what is owed us
B	yes that's right yeah
A	mm
B	you can't imagine the debt they've got now
A	and it's still
B	yeah
A	stuff in the world
B	all the world yeah
C	mm
A	incredible innit?
B	yeah so
C	why
B	I don't get mm
C	yeah
B	how do they
A	well it's it's
B	was it the Vietnam war and stuff like that was it?
A	it's just what what they their debt is?
B	yeah
A	well it's just like
B	yeah
A	which they owe money all over the place
B	and nobody's ever going to get it back are they?
A	no
B	I mean Argentina they've said no that's it right
A	mm
B	we're wiping out all our
A	yeah but Argentina is like on the world stage is like
B	yeah
A	Great Britain you know I mean
B	yeah it's true
A	I mean the
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	oh
B	December
C	mm
A	I mean it's like that isn't it?
B	yeah
A	for Argentina it's like the whole country's debt you know
B	yeah yeah
A	who?
B	has he not? Cameron he
A	well
B	yeah
A	that
B	yeah er political
A	it's a bit like that Ukraine stuff did you see what's happened now?
B	that's right yeah they do yeah
A	alright? and
B	Russia yeah
A	alright?
B	yeah
A	which doesn't pay its bills and owes Russia
B	loads of money
A	something like three point eight billion rubles
B	yeah
A	or dollars
B	oh I see
A	so Europe has now given Ukraine basically
C	right
A	euros
B	yeah
A	which they are now having to but Ukraine ain't gonna get it it's going straight to Russia
B	to Russia yeah
A	but we're supposed to have an embargo on trade with Russia
B	ah your well
A	you know it it only works
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	you know to hurt the small people
B	yeah
A	in fact on higher levels
B	yeah
A	there's no embargo at all it's the same that French who made that
B	that's right yes they have haven't they yeah
A	and that was like several billion pounds worth and they said oh well we'll we'll not deliver it and you say oh yeah?
A	I'm sure France are gonna turn their nose up at getting
B	well that's right
A	a couple of billion pounds or or whatever
B	well what would they want with a ship like that for?
A	yeah
B	they don't want to do it
A	no they'd rather have the money I'm sure
B	well of course they would
A	and of course what happened is oh forgotten about that and if you did sort of investigate it oh yeah well the deal went through and that ship is now in the Russian navy
B	that's right yeah yeah
A	I mean there's there's so much rubbish talked about all this stuff
B	there is isn't there?
A	and it's just to wind people up isn't it?
B	yeah yeah
A	you know it's just to get people annoyed
B	yeah
A	and like it all keeps going on in the background
B	yeah that's like er everybody now hates Angela Merkel
A	mm
B	because she asked
A	yeah
B	money up we want it she says
A	mm
B	and they said what's it got to do with Angela Merkel? everyone hates her now
A	mm
B	and yet
A	I mean it's the same as like
B	no
A	didn't stop Germany selling
B	to Germany no
A	and Russia selling stuff to Germany and
B	that's right
A	Britain selling stuff to Germany it didn't stop any of that you know if they had a
B	yeah
A	that's all that's needed you just give the stuff to them they shift it to Germany
B	which they've got I mean
A	that's right
B	everyone sends stuff to South America Argentina and Brazil and what have you and they
A	mm
A	that's right I mean in the second world war I mean Britain had so much influence
B	yeah they did yeah
A	you know through trading and
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and er places like Argentina
B	yeah
A	and that was practically owned by
B	yeah
A	British companies
B	they did
A	and
B	they were really right wing Brazil
A	yeah
B	that were it was very right wing
A	but they were all neutral in the war and could
B	yeah yeah
A	legally trade with each other
B	yeah yeah
A	you know it's just and like people like the Rothschild's Foundation
B	oh god
A	it's all built up you know all the money was made during the war er first and second
B	yeah
A	world wars
B	yeah
A	by sort of like
B	yeah
A	and getting really good deals and
B	well there's supposed to be a ring a ring of people living in
A	control the world's
B	control the world
A	the company yeah
B	yeah
A	well you can believe it
B	yeah
A	I mean there's
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah yeah
A	something like one of these companies who do you know take over things and run them
B	yeah
A	and they've got the contract for east of England for four hundred and fifty million quid to run the probation services
B	oh crickey
A	right?
B	yeah
A	and it's all they do they're working in hundreds of different countries
A	sort of providing services for hotels and then sort of branched out and branched out and
B	wow
A	and doing catering and stuff and then taking on this that and this
B	and they to be honest with they must have some kind of government influence in them in there
A	well the thing is once you get to a certain size you influence governments
B	yeah but I mean
A	you know what mean? you know
B	yeah
A	you've got so much money
B	yeah
A	you don't need governance
B	no but they it
C	mm
A	yeah
B	in the first instance
A	they must have some some some
B	they must have had a fiddle
A	to win all the contracts
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	saying what yeah
A	well it's the same as like you know
B	yeah god
A	and er G4S and things like
B	yeah
A	I mean they've got these contracts they make cock ups
B	they do don't they?
A	you know and they get found out with fiddling the books and god
B	yeah
A	the next thing you know oh there's another half a
B	yeah
A	and all these sort of jobs
B	yeah
A	you think
B	yeah
A	you know the you know I mean like Atos where they did that erm
B	yeah that's right
A	you know
B	well
A	sort of it for handicapped people and stuff like that
B	yeah
A	and put them off
B	yeah
A	and now you've got I don't know who the company is doing the erm
B	oh yeah
A	universal benefit they call it
B	they do don't they yeah
A	god that's a
B	yeah it is
A	I mean there's they said
C	mm
A	oh we're just having these trial areas of twenty-four thousand
B	yeah
A	just till it's sorted out
B	yeah for weeks on end
A	for not yeah and they said
C	mm
A	oh well we've got this thing that
A	that's four months
B	four months
C	mm
B	with no money
A	which means that you've got these people who are absolutely desperate
B	yeah
A	gotta go for four months
B	with nothing
A	with no money
B	that's right yeah
A	and they're patting each other on the back and you're saying well you should really you should have a three-day guarantee
B	yeah course they should but I mean if they got
A	mm
B	these people are keeping that for three months at round about six percent interest
A	well
B	yeah
A	you know it's it's like this thing whereby
B	that's right yeah
A	so in one go they
B	yeah that's right yeah
C	mm
A	and that never catches up because
B	no
C	yeah
A	you know it goes back to the
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but that whole week it's like
B	disappeared
C	gone
A	disappeared out of the
B	yeah
A	accountancy thing
C	yeah
B	that has hasn't it? yeah
C	mm
A	and er
B	and that's a week week's money for
C	yeah
A	where people have to live with no money
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I mean it's
B	that's scandalous
A	yeah it's all
C	yeah
A	it's all the country's run by accountants you know and
B	yeah
A	but I mean you
B	they're sharks
A	I notice that they've
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but now they changed the rules saying that it's worked out on your
B	yeah
A	and so of course
B	that's it she owes money
A	pay back a thousand pounds
C	yeah
B	she that's how much she's gotta pay back has she?
A	well she has paid back yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh it's terrible
A	and er you know so
C	mm
A	you know but I mean she's got
B	that's their their
A	but she's got bona fide expenses
B	yeah
A	which you know if you were a millionaire or a or a erm er MP
C	yeah you just claim
A	you know you just claim barefaced for them
B	yeah
A	and then everyone'll say oh yeah
C	mm
A	or er or worse you know but I mean she just the only thing she's
B	yeah
A	well you can't claim for travel to work she says yeah but I need my car to transport all my stuff which I have to carry cos I can't carry it
B	no
C	mm
A	you know cos I'm self-employed you know
B	yeah
A	and I haven't got anywhere at work to keep it so I have to you know
B	yeah
A	which is a bona fide
B	yeah that's right
A	how else would you get it there?
B	no
C	yeah
A	you know? no that won't count
C	mm
A	you know you're not gonna go through that rigmarole
B	no no
C	but if you are self-employed you can claim can't you? for for your
A	well that's right yeah
B	you're supposed to be able to claim for er
C	so is she
B	travel and
A	well off off her tax
A	off her tax she does
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	she claims all this and it's all allowed on the tax form
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and she claims for that but you see
C	mm
A	won't allow it
B	oh I see
A	they say you can't do it you see it's a different branch
C	but is that cos she's paid by
A	that's right
C	yeah? oh
A	they pay her
C	mm
A	sort of PAYE
C	mm
B	yeah
C	so that makes a difference
A	because they won't
B	no
C	yeah
A	you know and and that is
B	yeah
A	and when you work
C	oh
A	then they'd work for theem again the same but
B	yeah
A	on a monthly
B	monthly
A	fee
B	yeah yeah
A	rather than a monthly wage
C	mm
B	yeah
A	which meant that they saved paying
B	yeah
A	and
B	yeah
A	and all this other stuff
C	yeah
A	and these people are getting and claiming loads and loads of expenses
A	and not paying any tax you know
B	amazing  ain't it?
C	mm
A	and the government cracked down on that
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There are some people who were not consistent in paying their taxes.	Entailment
A	and so and
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The government didn't enforce the law for tax evasion.	Contradiction
A	can't get paid
C	mm
A	on an invoice you know I mean if she er you know really she should just
C	that's right
A	the the er
C	this is what I charge
A	the office
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and get the money
B	yeah
A	for what she's owed
[ANNOTATION]	Someone cannot receive payment.	Entailment
C	mm mm
A	but er but because they won't do that and then
C	yeah
A	the tax credit people get in touch with the er PAY people PAYE people
B	yeah
C	yeah
C	and suddenly this year they said oh we see that you have earned blah blah blah from this and
B	yeah
A	so they already had the figures
B	yeah
C	mm
A	but they were like I say gross
[ANNOTATION]	PAYE people have not relation with tax credit individuals.	Contradiction
B	gross
A	pay before the deductions
[ANNOTATION]	Gross wage is payment after tax deduction.	Contradiction
C	yeah
A	which put her over the limit and see there's a limit of something like thirteen thousand
B	yeah
C	tut yeah
B	so they'd done it on gross instead of net then?
A	yeah
B	that's disgusting
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Gross wage is high in England.	Neutral
B	ain't it?
C	mm
A	and
C	yeah
A	didn't really have a leg to stand on if they'd cos they'd changed the rules you see
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	that's right
C	they do
A	but I mean you can imagine that
B	yeah
A	you know you go down the Jobcentre
B	so many jobs
A	every week
B	mm
A	and
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	if you're there for an appointment and you miss it by a quarter of an hour oh
C	you've missed a
A	you're suspended you know and all this
B	yeah
A	and they expect
C	yeah
A	these people to walk out of there with no money
C	and you you think how how
A	yeah
C	how?
B	how do they survive?
A	cos I mean these people
C	yeah
A	they they haven't got anything in the bank have they?
B	no
C	no
B	no
A	you know they've got no cash
C	they have to go to food banks and
A	well they have to go to the blooming
C	whatever
A	payday loan companies
B	yeah
A	cos I mean there's
C	and they're in a spiral down aren't they then?
A	yeah but I mean the thing is that quite honestly I know quite a few people who have
B	no
A	cos they says
C	yeah
A	you know alright

B	that's right
A	I haven't got a house I've got nothing you know

B	cos she had six kids
A	oh right yeah mm
B	right? and the bailiffs were saying oh yes this this is an awful job when you get poor people like that with
A	mm
B	we got we gotta put them out on the street
A	mm
B	but when they went into the house
C	she's wrecked wasn't it completely wrecked
B	and the place was absolutely wreck
C	it was awful
B	and there was one piece of furniture a beautiful piece of furniture which they
C	I saw the end bit
B	and they'd carved slag in it
B	and
C	oh it was just horrendous
B	and I
A	it makes you feel sorry for landlords hey?
B	well
B	it made you feel sorry for this poor woman
C	oh it did yeah
B	cos she when she walked into the house to
A	yeah why didn't she do something earlier?
B	well this is the whole point
A	cos I mean the thing is
C	perhaps they never let them in
B	no
A	the thing is that these people
B	well that's right I mean
A	and I if you if I was
C	yeah
A	I mean mind you they're changing that now but in the you know in the past the Housing Benefit was paid direct to the landlord
B	yeah
C	oh right
B	yeah
A	and so if you were renting a property to someone and they couldn't pay the rent you'd say look I'll sort you know I'll go with you to the housing
B	yeah
A	you know we'll sort it out I'll you know we'll
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'll go with your rent book and then
C	mm
A	they can pay me direct
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah she
A	and then you'd get your money and they'd be
C	it's true yeah
B	but the the whole point is er about this this thing
C	mm
B	you'd never get the the true circumstances in these
A	no
B	in these erm
A	no no no
B	little bits and pieces
C	no
A	cos the thing is they're making a programme which they want to shock and horror you know
B	that's right yeah
C	yeah
A	you know shock people and
C	mm
A	they aren't gonna pick the nice people who leave and leaves every immaculate
B	no
C	that's right
A	and redecorate and stuff like that they're gonna get
C	yeah
A	the worst case they can find
B	and and that
A	when that person
B	when and they took over the house though you see they went in this room and they had a forty-eight inch screen flat television on the wall
A	yeah
B	and they went in another room and that had another forty-eight
C	really?
B	yeah
C	oh
B	erm
A	well I thought you said how's all the furniture was gone
B	their the woman's furniture had gone but they'd bought these televisions
A	oh right
B	so where they got and how they managed to do that I don't know but I mean in the end
A	people love that don't they?
B	yeah
A	I mean
C	mm
A	I notice this you know and you know a private house just been sold
B	television on the wall
A	the size of your window
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	then like there's no pictures or nothing no decoration just sort of like
A	painted bear light bulb
C	yeah
A	and a huge
B	a massive thing
A	great television on the wall
C	yeah
B	well what they do with it though
A	and they sit there you know with the curtains open you know so you can watch them watching telly
B	yeah
B	but the when
C	mm
B	televisions
A	mm
B	and
A	oh yeah?
B	and
A	well they're about four hundred quid each aren't they?
B	yeah and they
C	yeah
B	these Playstations for all the kids one one for each of the kids
A	mm
B	bar the little ones
A	that's why they need the televisions you see
C	yeah of course you do
B	yeah so so you know and this woman smoked and drank like fish
A	and
B	no I don't think so
A	oh they missed out there
B	they did didn't they?
A	didn't they? or Latvian
C	you can't win everything
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean they ticked six boxes but not the seventh
B	yeah that's true
A	to generate hate
B	I mean they should have been eastern European shouldn't they?
A	cos the funny thing is is that you know that Benefits Street
B	yeah I haven't seen it
A	about six months ago yeah
C	mm we saw a couple that's all
A	yeah er and er they had that woman big Di or something like that
B	oh right okay
A	who was this sort of
C	mm
A	matriarch sort of slaggy woman
A	who then they picked on to
C	yeah
A	I mean she's a a celebrity now
B	is she? and making money
A	and and she sort of like but she's really articulate she isn't you know you know they tried to make her out that she was like a a crook and a thief and a
B	yeah
A	mental moron you know and all this lot
B	but she
A	but you know she's sort of like they've sort of
B	of the people
C	what advice of
A	of the
C	what to do benefits
A	of the er people on benefit about how it really is
B	yeah
A	and I heard her on the radio the other day you know she was talking quite a lot of sense
C	yeah
B	yeah?
A	she really was and er you know they sort of give her a hard
B	oh right
A	and and er or one of these sort of reality
B	yeah
A	thing shows and then sort of
C	mm
A	give her a bit of a makeover and stuff
B	yeah yeah
A	that she was
B	and she can talk
A	and she's got her head on her you know
B	yeah
A	a brain in the head as well
B	yeah well we used to have a bloke living in
C	who?
C	oh yeah yeah
C	yes he knew how to
B	god he knew how to
C	do the benefits thing
B	do the system
A	mm
B	he really did
C	he did
A	oh really?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	mm
B	he was a nice bloke weren't he?
A	mm
C	mm
B	and
A	but the thing about the benefits system is there's a book about that thick by about that big closely written
B	yeah
A	and if you could be bothered
B	yeah
A	and you read up all these rules and regulations you'd be streets ahead of anyone
B	yeah
A	you know who was interviewing you about these things
B	well this is what this bloke did
A	you could
B	yeah
A	you know you know someone who could do that
B	he knew everything about benefits
A	yeah
B	he did didn't he?
A	yeah
C	yes he did yeah
B	and he he actually tied them in knots
A	mm I'm sure because I'm sure there's loads of rules which like never got repealed
B	that's right yeah
A	like old rules and stuff like that
B	yeah yeah
A	which you could you could you know easily sort of bring up
B	yeah
A	you know and
B	yeah
A	no no it's er well you just have a look on so and so you know rule like
B	that's right
A	you know
C	mm
A	yeah this is
B	paragraph three you know
A	this is what this is what barristers do don't they?
B	yeah and and he was he he
A	mm
B	fought his own case in court
C	I

B	but he
C	yeah

B	yeah he
C	I think she might
B	broke away with
C	have come back or something I don't know
A	mm
C	but er
B	see they the they came round ours
C	they were very well spoken
A	mm
C	the children were
B	the kids were fantastic he took them to school every day
C	not terribly well dressed but
A	mm
C	yeah
B	he was brilliant and then
C	mm
B	I mean she was very soft-spoken and what have you frightened the life out of him though she was really frightened of him
C	mm
B	and er she ran off to
A	oh right
B	and
C	of course he got them back
B	he got them back for a bit

C	at high school weren't they? he'd brought
B	yeah
C	he'd put them up from from when they were tiny to high school
B	he brought them up brilliantly he really did
C	and then we don't know what happened then
B	and then something went wrong
A	mm
B	cos we lost contact with him
A	yeah
B	and the next thing we knew he'd hung himself
A	mm
B	you know
C	road
A	yeah
C	that mm not
B	and
C	the you know the road that's
B	you go all the way up
A	I don't I don't think I've ever been down that road any er
C	haven't you? oh
B	well you go all the way up from
C	there's some interesting properties
B	yeah
C	down there
A	what?
C	there's some quite interesting properties down there
B	yeah there is some fantastic places
A	mm
B	you go all the way up there
C	yeah
B	and there's a great big barn on the corner which you have to turn
A	mm
C	mm
B	sharp and
A	no I think I mean
B	go in the barn
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	that was his house and and the that was his barn
C	yeah it was his barn he used to
B	and that was his homestead
A	mm
C	preserve
B	yeah
C	a preservation order on it
A	preservation order on it there yeah
B	cos that's a that's around round er
A	oh right yeah
C	mm
B	round corner barn you know
A	uhu
C	but they've they've now built a very swish house in
B	cor they've done a swish house
C	cos the
B	on it now yeah
A	mm
B	fantastic place on it now but the
C	the proviso was it had to be built
B	lay empty for years
C	had to be demolished
A	oh really?
C	they had to demolish it mm
B	yeah they demolished that and no one wanted to buy it
A	cos he'd hung himself
C	mm
A	ay?
B	yeah yeah no one wanted to buy it it laid there for years and years didn't it?
C	mm
B	empty and then somebody come along and thought way
A	yeah
C	well I thought well worth it
B	er?
C	I thought cos we had a look round
B	so did I
C	didn't we?
B	we went and looked round
A	mm
C	it was a bit of a state in there but er
B	mm it was worth every penny
C	the amount of land yeah
B	had acres of land
A	mm
B	on the marshes over the field
C	mm
B	cos he he borrowed my
A	yeah
B	and broke it
C	oh
A	well they were pigs weren't they they
A	no they they were the worst thing for
B	yeah
A	your your your midriff
B	that's right yeah
C	had it to cut all our hay weren't it?
A	cos they just
B	yeah we cut our hay with it
C	mm
A	cos once I had a go and they
B	you couldn't stop them
A	and unless you're on a perfectly flat bit of ground
B	oh take them round with
A	yeah you'd be
B	you know you could
A	bloody things
B	anyway he smashed up some
C	mm
B	so we we sold it in the end
A	sorry I seem to have grazed your Allen Scythe
B	we did sell it in the end though didn't we
C	yeah? I don't know cos we got another one didn't we
A	must have done got rid of it
C	we got another one after that
B	yeah
C	must have done
B	we did sell it but I don't know what happened to it
C	yeah
B	anyhow that's what happened to him
C	yeah
B	poor old boy I mean it's that but he was a nice fellow at first and he he was very very articulate
A	mm
B	very very brainy
A	mm
B	he was on the edge you know that edge you get
A	yeah well this is it
B	yeah
A	when the loneliness kicks in
B	that's right yeah
C	mm
B	yeah that's true
C	and you
B	on his little he's well he's manic depressive anyway
C	oh dear
A	in his little cottage over the winter
B	oh dear
C	I'll go and visit him
C	yeah
B	we went round
C	what you think now he can't get out?
A	well he's getting out
C	much
A	to
C	yeah
A	he ain't he's sort of like
B	yeah
A	but erm
B	concerned would be a better word
A	you know I mean I'm
B	yeah
A	and I think I'm better at it than
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	but
B	he is and
A	you know what I mean?
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	he's sort of like
B	well he made himself hard to
C	he's alone he is a loner anyway isn't he?
A	what?
C	he is a he is a loner isn't he?
A	well I think well he's a loner but he's a loner who
B	wants
A	who wants to be sociable
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know what I mean? he can cope on his own
B	yeah
C	mm
A	you know he's he's er he's very good at practical thing but I think he'd much rather you know be involved with other people
B	well he likes to go round the country visiting his old mates don't he?
A	well he does he does that a lot
B	mm
C	he's got a lot of friends
B	he's got a lot of friends
A	he does yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah but the trouble is they're all sort of fairly rich and fairly spread out aren't they?
B	yeah yeah
A	and he's I think he feels like the poor
B	well he ain't
A	poor buddy
B	he ain't poor really is he he's got enough money
A	well he ain't got much at the moment er cos he he don't get his old age pension yet
B	no
A	he's sort of living on
B	oh right
A	you know sort of bits and bobs of er
C	which is more than
A	is a lot
C	a state pension surely
A	keep me alive wouldn't it?
A	well it's a lot more than I get
B	yeah
A	but
B	or all we lived on is our state pensions it's all we've got
A	but he he erm
B	lifestyle yeah
A	yeah he sort of wants to go on holidays and
B	yeah whereas we
A	you know he's
B	we all live very frugally don't we?
A	well that's right and he wants to sort of drive all over the county and
B	that's right yeah
A	you know and
B	well it only
A	well I think he's getting about thirty out of it
B	is he?
A	which you know it ain't too bad I suppose
B	well
A	I think he's driving it a lot
A	and er
B	well I dunno why he want to keep it
A	well cos it still goes well you see
B	yeah but it costs him a lot of money to keep it going well don't it?
A	yeah I know but the trouble is is that like you say you buy another car
B	yeah that's true
A	and that could be just as you know like people don't sell their car you know it's going well
B	no they don't no
A	you know when they sell a car it's probably gonna need to something doing to it or
B	yeah
A	you know whatever
B	what were the our our car called er who
C	what?
B	when we went to buy this car they that's a certain
C	oh mobility
B	mobility car
A	oh yeah
B	that was a mobility car you see
A	mm
B	and I er it only done fifteen thousand
A	yeah but what
B	nothing
C	no it's it's just a normal car but they
B	yeah I know but
A	well I think that's yeah cos people who who get mobility allowance
C	they provide them
B	yeah
A	they
C	with that car
A	get this allowance of something like
B	yeah
A	and you can just pay that straight to a garage and they'll just give you a car
B	that's it
A	a free car
B	yeah
B	yeah we thought it was a good deal when we when we bought it
[ANNOTATION]	They are always giving out Audis because nobody buys them.	Neutral
A	yeah
C	mm
A	god I'm trying to think what went wrong with
B	oh what the the
[ANNOTATION]	They bought it.	Entailment
A	the power steering pump
B	oh yeah he did say that was like trying to pull a tank round
A	yeah well he erm
C	put the light on
A	more
C	put the light
B	yeah
A	more expense and that and as it happened he went round this breakers at
B	yeah
A	and er
A	like new ones are about two hundred quid I think
[ANNOTATION]	They are quite expensive, more than a hundred pounds, if you buy them new.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	and so he took them to his mate to put on
B	yeah
A	and his bill wasn't gonna be as expensive as he thought
B	oh right
A	which means that he had to like dismantle the front
B	the that's right
A	and you imagine that thing I mean they ain't I mean them sort of powerful cars aren't they they've got
B	yeah
A	sit and they had to like totally dismantle the front of the car to get these two gaiters on which pushed the bill up by another about a hundred and fifty quid or something
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Thy avoided dismanteling the fron of the car, which reduced the overall cost.	Contradiction
B	well I suppose
A	but it's
B	they told him first though
C	yeah
B	innit?
A	oh yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah but it's see you
[ANNOTATION]	The mechanic is a friend of them, so they got a discount.	Neutral
B	mm
A	and he said oh
B	as he's got yeah
C	yeah
A	except it's
[ANNOTATION]	A thing that made the reparations more expensive are the gaiters.	Entailment
B	oh right
C	yeah
A	but it's four wheel drive got this you know not such a
B	no
A	but it's more modern and cos he wants an
C	mm
A	he wants a four wheel drive and he wants an estate so he can haul wood about
C	yeah
A	you know
B	yeah
A	all this sort of stuff
B	well why not just put a tow bar on it and
A	and he said he said er
B	well
A	and I said
B	yeah
A	he says well you know mine and you know mine is still going you know I don't wanna chuck it away until it really
B	goes
A	conks out
A	I said well you could buy it and park it up somewhere
B	yeah
A	so that when yours does conk out
B	yeah
C	mm
A	you know you've got another car
B	or he could look for how much money he can get for his car
A	well
B	could he?
A	I mean that's ancient that's M reg
B	yeah I know yeah
C	yeah
A	you know I mean it is I mean he's got some good wear and tear out of it I'll tell you
B	he has yeah he has
A	mm
B	you can hear him coming anyway can't you?
B	yeah
A	a lot of burbling and droning
B	brrr brrr
B	the cops have got that haven't they?
A	no
B	they've got Subarus
A	don't no I don't think so
B	not not around this area
A	oh could well have yeah
B	yeah
A	either that or Mitsubishi
B	oh I've seen
A	whatever them fancy Mitsubishi sports cars are
B	yeah they no they've got Subarus cos there was a programme on er
A	no er yeah
B	oh right
A	cross country
B	yeah
B	and they've got these Subarus
A	mm
B	that can do hundred and thirty mile an hour apparently or more
A	well I think they only do about a hundred and eighty
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and they can catch anything
A	well
B	and I watched them chasing a Mercedes
A	oh
B	on there and er well they couldn't catch the Mercedes and then they got onto the
A	mm
B	up the end of the
C	mm
A	like that on motorways should they?
B	shouldn't no
A	nothing
B	that's what they said but they did
B	they had the police helicopter following them too
A	yeah
C	mm
B	they had the and they the police helicopter was giving all the information to the police that were following him
A	but they love it don't they?
B	and a police helicopter
A	yeah the police love it don't they?
B	oh do they? god what? yeah and they're taking the name of the policeman and what you're doing
A	mm
B	and how he's doing it and what his favourite film is and everything
C	mm
B	oh dear anyhow they they followed this Merc
A	mm
B	for miles up the
A	I'll tell you what we watched and like it was er er Storage Hunters
B	oh I know Storage Hunters
A	did you
C	mm
A	see that they
B	they've got to have it in Britain now
A	yeah well they've had they've broadcast it and
B	have they? oh I missed it then
A	and they got the
B	yeah
A	and two and ITV had the biggest audience one point one million people watched the British one
B	did they?
A	yeah
B	oh wow
B	I wished I'd have seen that I
C	mm
A	I am getting a little bit fed up with it though cos I mean you watch it enough and you get the er
B	yeah well
A	the format
B	you see I got the format
A	no
B	of the other one
A	yeah
B	I haven't seen that
A	on Quest
B	oh Quest I haven't seen that no
A	well
B	yeah
A	what they do is they buy an er a sort of a classic car
B	yes
A	Lotus Elan or something they get a different one every week
B	yeah
A	and what they do is they then bring it up to sort of like really good condition
B	well isn't
A	no no no no
B	isn't
A	this is pukka
B	oh right
A	and they bring it up to the sort of nearly mint condition and then sell it and try and make a profit on it
B	yeah
A	the fact that they don't take the workshop expenses apart from the cost factor you know
B	yeah
A	and there's this bloke who goes out and does the buying and there's this other bloke who does all the work in the thing
B	in the yeah
A	in the garage and
C	yeah
A	he sort of says things like oh you know it was a bit dodgy on the steering it was one this is a problem with you know the the front er bearing
B	yeah
A	so what they have to do is we take the wheel off and then there's a nut here you have to undo you undo the nut and then you can draw the hub and the bearing comes off of the hub and then to get the bearing up you know you take and he says you can do this job yourself you know cos the cost of the bearing is quite and it's all fairly straightforward
B	yeah
A	and he says and while we've got the hub down we'll just check the shock absorbers to make sure it's not leaking and this one's
B	brilliant
A	really
C	mm
A	instructive
B	oh that's great
A	and I sort of know most of what he's talking about
B	yeah
A	but know you I just wish they'd had something like that when I was a kid you know?
B	yeah yeah
A	cos you know you sort of worked and he says oh you know there's a bit of a grinding from the back axel so what we do is we you know undo these bolts here and you'll see the you know the where is the back axel thing and you're oh look these well these are chipped these gears here so what we're gonna do is replace them so how you do that there's a circlip there so you get a circlip and clip that and do you can just draw it off
A	put the lid on
B	oh that sounds brilliant
C	mm
A	you know even things like changing the
B	and that's on Quest is it?
A	and changing the break-pads and that
B	yeah
A	and he don't you know it's not the same every time sometimes he puts a new exhaust on sometimes he puts a new windscreen in
B	yeah
A	you know and sometimes he puts seat covers on or something like that
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	or seats in or sometimes he welds I think he
B	yeah
A	he says well this bit is a bit rotten he says so
A	oh look you can see the rust so I just grind the bits off there
B	yeah
C	mm
A	sort of thing absolutely fantastic this guy
B	what's it a Mig welder is it he's got?
A	erm
B	not an arc welder?
A	yeah it's a Mig welder I think yeah
B	yeah and Mig welders are brilliant and
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think that Mig welders are very capable	Neutral
A	well he don't
A	show you all of it
B	no
A	but he was using an arc welder on it a er
B	was he?
A	er no no an arc a a gas welder
B	was he? a gas welder oh
A	on some of it
B	yeah he'd be brazing a bit on them
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said he would be harden on them	Entailment
A	but anyway but
C	mm
A	what I'm you know I mean this guy the mechanic bloke it's just like an education
B	yeah
A	if they showed that in film to
B	yeah
A	mechanics
B	yeah
A	they could learn so much
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B know that Person A is a great actress	Contradiction
A	I mean like for half our lesson
B	yeah
A	you know for a trainee mechanic that is absolutely brilliant
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
C	mm
B	of course they have a lot of programmes on BBC2 sometimes for the Open University they're really good programmes
A	mm
B	I mean I'll watch them quite often don't I? but they got this woman who's a
C	yeah
B	she also does something
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is quite sure that he see some of the programs	Entailment
A	mm
B	sort of you've got the picture there and the woman standing in front of it doing sign language for for non-hearing people but
A	mm mm mm
B	you tend to forget about her after a while cos if you get interested
C	mm
B	in the programme
A	mm
B	you're okay
A	you know he's on that
B	that's it yeah
C	ha
B	yeah
A	anyway look I'd better make
C	yeah
