B	yeah it's triple triple
A	that's the bit that's tricky
B	and look at the recipe
A	what?
B	look at the recipe
A	er triple oh triple chocolate rock cakes that's still hard to say though isn't it?
B	mm triple chocolate rock cakes
A	and what else were you thinking that you wanted to have as well?
B	well
C	erm your muffins
B	we could do a mixture of vanilla and chocolate muffins
A	yes we could
B	but we could do a little bit of icing on top because last time you didn't
A	we didn't well well er we didn't I didn't have time to do the icing cos you snaffled them very quickly didn't you?
B	yeah but now we do
A	yeah well the yeah so they were fudge cupcakes
C	mm
A	so we can have the fudge topping but I'm glad that you really liked the the cupcakes so that's good and we could go healthy eating and do ones with cherries and apple which are delicious
C	oh yeah
B	hey I've got
A	cos you really really liked them when you were little
B	and maybe we can put a little batch of chocolate sauce and have some like
A	what? what like when we did the kebabs do you mean? or?
B	yeah
A	a sauce to dip the fruit in?
B	yeah
A	well I think that's going a bit over the top there
B	well
C	oh I just
B	and we could get some fruit as well just so after those we could give them some refreshments
C	mum
A	well they're we're gonna have a Greek salad cos one of them's making a Greek salad
C	mum in your lesson
A	yes
C	er could we play the game where you say where somebody starts off a story with one word like there
A	mm?

B	there was a pirate poo poo pants
C	no a goat
A	mm?
C	eating grass on a farm

C	erm no
B	okay let's start
A	well explain the game a bit more to me?
C	so
B	I'll explain it
C	one person that says a word to start off a story the next person says another word the two carry on the story and then
A	but you have to
C	yeah so it makes you think about them but I'll
A	I think that some of my students might find that a bit tricky
B	no it's only for that they and they can do there was there was a big man eating giant
C	well
