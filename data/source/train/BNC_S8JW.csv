B	she was like well you better be heading off cos you wanna get up before it gets dark don't you? we were like er
A	we clocked in at like an hour for the visit
B	just just about made an hour
[ANNOTATION]	They clocked in for a couple of hours for the visit	Contradiction
C	mm
B	sort of think
C	that's what my nan would be like if when
C	when you visit her she always like oh well you better be doing something
A	yeah
C	at least apart from like being here
A	cos we were like quite happy to spend a bit of time there and things but
C	mm
A	like when she gets it like in her mind it's like that's
C	yeah
A	kind of it then isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	They were very content that they would spend some time there	Entailment
C	oh
D	yeah exactly
C	mm
B	just like mm could've been here little bit longer
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	They could have stayed there for a longer period	Entailment
D	mm
C	no just mince pie for you
A	no that's it we're tossed out
C	you've got some good war paint on you
B	yeah
A	oh
A	he always he's so yeah about a week up in
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C is talking about mince pie	Entailment
A	track
B	yeah
A	and then at my parents for a couple of days as well over in New Year so
C	mm
A	we've done the full family experience
B	yeah that was a bit more tea drinky wasn't it?
A	well
B	do like a good walk
A	yeah like we saw friends and
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They have spent some time with family	Entailment
A	things so
C	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	who has a small
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is referring to something small	Entailment
A	small baby
B	we have a pizza with baked beans on it
C	it's quite exiting
B	it's veggie breakfast pizza
C	mm
B	disappointingly didn't have any sausage on
C	ah
A	ah mm
B	yeah yeah
C	that's a shame
A	it's an interesting concept so we'd thought we'd try it
C	mm
A	but we feel I don't think if we took it further
B	it was just
C	yeah needed to go like
A	yeah the whole hog
C	did it have some hash browns on?
B	no see that's what we
A	no
A	and no egg either
B	that's what we exactly what we said
C	no egg
D	we're like what kind of veggie makes this pizza?
C	was it just baked beans and normal pizza then?
B	I know
A	bean mushroom tomato
C	oh
A	but that was that's about it you're like oh we've gotta push it come on
C	okay
C	yeah
B	tasty because the the
D	find like mushroom dry on an average pizza as well so
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	so just really the baked beans is the novelty
B	the baked beans did add something
A	yeah
B	they did you know
C	mm
A	but I feel like like they could've gone for the fried egg thing on it you know
C	mm
B	fried egg in the middle a bit of hash browns and veggie sausage round the outside with a big crisp on it
C	mm
B	would've been good
A	anyway we might try this ourselves some time
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and you know
C	yeah
D	be a good idea I'll get some
C	mm
D	pizza for breakfast
C	mm
D	mind you hold that handle while it comes towards me
C	oh
A	yeah so two two small nieces up in Newcastle
C	oh
A	with my family
A	been a lot of a lot of small children
B	it's a bit
A	five months isn't it? so
B	five months so it was no bother cos we just went to the pub
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The two nieces in Newcastle are twins.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	and took the baby
D	what's QI?
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D is wondering what QI is.	Entailment
B	what?
D	what's QI?
unknown_female	mm mm
B	it's like a questiony
D	oh
B	questiony
A	shall I give you a scoop?
unknown_female	oh yeah go on then
unknown_female	mm
C	yeah we escaped all babies and almost all relatives
C	yeah that's fine though
A	that's acceptable
C	yeah
B	yeah
unknown_female	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	No one replied to speaker D what QI is.	Entailment
D	so you did have lots of phone conversations
C	oh yeah my mum
A	just to check up on you
C	yeah
A	cos you're cos you and your sister were in one place she thought she thought she'd like maximise
C	well there was that but it was going on before she came as well
C	no that was the like flimsy excuse of it
unknown_female	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A and his/her speaker were in different places.	Contradiction
C	sometimes
D	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker sometimes gets a lot of phone conversations.	Neutral
C	sometimes it's like just really I think it was because she was feeling a bit kind of funny cos she was quite sort of
A	thanks
C	she's looking after
A	oh
B	mm
C	erm
B	yeah
C	they have to go out for walks but that that's all they he can do
[ANNOTATION]	They go out for very long walks at the beach.	Neutral
A	oh
C	she has needs to do all the cooking which she's like really
unknown_female	oh
A	is that usually his role?
C	yeah
D	so he must be quite pissed off with that as well
C	yeah
C	but that's why my sister was on about those boxes that she got with the spices and the recipes
D	no
C	maybe not
D	get in there
C	ten quid
A	oh okay
C	and they you do
B	okay
C	I mean she had the one er all of the recipes were meat ones and we didn't have any of the ingredients and they didn't even seem like they'd be that transferable
B	well they didn't have any for me?
C	no
C	erm
C	but erm
A	mm
C	yeah cos she's not very good at seasoning anything so
B	mm
A	mm
D	what so your mum?
C	mm
C	mm quite hot
B	just trying to work out whether it was the fact that I'd slathered that bit in hot mango chutney or what
A	yeah yeah
C	no
A	there was a bit of a tingle
C	I think it must be
C	I think that's especially hot cayenne pepper cos I seem to have done that every time I've used it
D	mm
B	I think I've either got a jittery cayenne pepper hand or
D	I really
A	cayenne pepper can be pretty funky
B	quite like Spanish
C	piri piri was it or?
B	Spanish or
A	it's just paprika
B	oh there we go we haven't touched that since
A	but
A	I have
B	have you?
A	just well a tiny little drizzle occasionally you know
A	just of the oil
D	yeah it was a good pizza
C	I don't think I've ever eaten a pizza so slowly
C	probably
D	I would say it was a
C	I think it's really nice yeah
B	yeah
C	crusty on the outside squidgy on the inside
D	all you need to do is like slim down the
A	it was quite complicated
C	oh was it? oh
A	well you had to like start this little bit of dough overnight
C	mm
A	called the pre-ferment
C	mm
A	and that's like a really like quite stiff bit that
C	right
A	had to like develop for like twelve hours
C	oh blimey
A	to get some structure going because then the the full dough mix is like really wet and sloppy
C	oh
A	and so then you combine that little bit with it which then adds some adds some kind of structure
A	but you still you can't like knead it out on a board you just have to do it in a bowl because it's so wet and
B	oh okay
A	so you're just kind of
C	boing
A	pulling up these strands
A	of dough and er
A	it was quite
B	I did think you'd gone mad cos I
B	nothing in here
B	smallest loaf of bread in the world
C	every half an hour
D	it raises
C	wow
A	over the course of like two hours
C	yeah
A	just meant like you couldn't stray too far away
C	mm
A	fun to try so
C	wow
C	years ago that was quite hard work but at least it was only within one day
D	was it the sort of thing that you could like double up and make loaves of?
A	er yeah I suppose so
D	you freeze it?
A	yeah cos
C	mm
A	I think it's one that's quite good fresh isn't it so yeah but I suppose yeah you freeze it and
unknown_female	mm
C	mm
D	mm that was good and hot
C	it's warming you up after a day outside
D	it's nice
B	that's the irony we've
C	ah
A	mm
B	just like all we've done all day is hit one rock
C	cold wet hands er
A	oh
B	and make it slightly smaller
C	so couldn't you use that saw thing on it just to cut a nice line and that'd be done?
B	yeah we did
unknown_female	mm we done
C	erm but then those
B	yeah
C	little bits so
D	and and even that was quite
B	well
D	struggled
B	we just we'll just turn on the power drill bam-bam-bam
D	the SDS
C	oh
D	the SDS is sort of like dying a little bit
C	oh
D	slow action
C	to be fair I thought we killed it downstairs a while back
D	I think so we replaced the brushes on it though didn't we?
C	oh right
D	but then there's still
A	yeah
D	I don't I don't know why they would be dodgy again already
C	mm haven't done much since that with it have we?
D	mm not loads
C	mm
B	quite a lot of oil appears to be mm throwing out the front of it
D	mm
B	which is slightly worrying
C	mm
D	maybe it's the SDS chuck maybe it's the chuck that's like not quite right
B	no
C	it's very
D	I was mentioning that today
C	oh
A	yeah guess what we've got a jar as well that's the problem
C	oh
C	is it the same?
A	I think I I do like it but I take the point it is it is quite vinegary
D	who who didn't?
C	yeah
D	who brought it? who brought it?
C	erm
C	he wasn't fussy
D	well that's what he said but then he didn't like most things
C	well we didn't serve him anything that he didn't eat
A	is he a carnivore?
C	yeah
D	I was hoping you were gonna say he like
A	mm
D	snuck out at three in the morning
A	mm
C	for a for a steak
C	somewhere
A	did you have a good Christmas dinner?
C	yeah
A	veggie works?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	came at like on the twenty-seventh and stayed until like New Year's Eve so
A	oh okay
C	erm yeah but Christmas dinner was good but we it was so sunny here it was like a really nice day so we didn't bother cooking it until it had got
A	no
C	dark basically and then
A	that makes more sense
D	mm
C	watch double bill Star Trek movies
A	oh
C	with Christmas dinner
A	sounds good
A	mm we were slightly like regimented Christmas Day
C	mm
A	so you had to eat at the middle of the day
C	mm
A	I think and then and then there were dogs to be walked in the morning too so
C	it was like right
A	yeah exactly things had to be done by certain times and er
B	yeah we didn't have to get to my brother's house until one o'clock for that for some reason that we had to go for eight
B	and then some of us had to drive away
D	yeah
C	that's what it's a bit like with my mum
A	we had to be in bed for twelve
C	mm that's quite extreme for Christmas isn't it?
A	yeah
C	mm
D	could you pass me a tissue from behind you
B	alright now here we go
D	it's normally on the window sill there
unknown_female	mm
A	anyway I
C	oh
A	eleven adults on Christmas Day but what
C	oh
A	oh I I made my own thing to contribute
C	oh
A	but someone else actually had the bacon
B	yeah
A	cos she didn't really like turkey
C	mm
A	so
B	cos no one really likes turkey
B	just eat
A	then why do you bother?
B	because it's traditional
D	to have dry unsatisfying
B	don't want to
A	did your brother follow in the tradition of overcooking?
B	no no it was the juiciest no it was the juiciest turkey that I've had in a long while
A	you
B	yeah
A	she likes the carrots to sort of melt as you bite them
B	I think melt's the wrong word I think she'd prefer if it was you put the fork under it and lifted it through and just like
A	just big mush
B	sort of
A	erm the worst thing is like the jacket potatoes because
C	oh
A	I kind of see the point is that you get a crispy skin
C	yeah
A	but she cooks them just completely wrapped in foil like the whole thing
C	oh so they're just gooey?
B	yeah
A	so you just have this like soft
C	mm
C	that isn't right
C	oh
B	yeah
C	oh
B	did we have jacket potatoes did we?
D	anybody like another slice of bread?
A	oh yeah yeah
C	oh I'll have one
C	woah
unknown_female	woah
B	pirate bread
A	what flavour?
C	cranberry
A	ah
C	cos all the cranberries like Coop seem to have massively overstocked them so
A	oh yeah
C	it's just like pretty much all they had left was cranberries
A	oh cool
C	cheap cranberries yay
B	we went to Tesco's like a massive Tesco's on Christmas Eve
C	mm
B	looking at the and we like
C	er yeah
B	you know some sort of
A	think it was this one
D	mm
C	he's quite nice
unknown_female	yeah
B	erm
C	mm
A	chestnuts
B	well we didn't have any chestnuts
C	mm
A	but I got enough in the end anyway so
C	didn't have any chestnuts or sage but everything else was fine
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I'm not quite sure what else yeah
C	yeah it's alright
D	I'd like erm half a ciabatta
C	yeah
D	to begin with
unknown_female	and that's relatively on fire
C	mm
B	you've spilled a bit on your hand there
C	d'you want d'you want some butter? d'you want any butter?
D	yes
D	shall I get it?
C	okay
A	I'm just observing your mm couscous dishing out skills
A	erm no I'm alright thanks
C	what did you make for Christmas dinner?
A	erm
A	like a
C	mm
A	it had like mashed parsnip in
C	mm
C	that sounds quite exciting
A	to sort of help like bind it together and then
C	yeah
A	I put some blue cheese through it as well
C	oh
A	since
C	mm
A	since
C	that sounds good
B	you couldn't particularly taste the well you you could tell that there was
C	mm
A	so it was like
C	mm
A	hazelnuts I think
C	mm
A	and then like some parsnip
C	mm
A	and then we did we did it in a loaf tin and then it had like sort of slices of parsnip at at the bottom
B	right er along right at the bottom of the loaf tin
C	oh right
A	so it's layered
B	like quite densely packed with
A	with partly cooked
C	right
A	and then you turned it out and then you got this nice sort of parsnip on top afterwards
C	oh cool yeah
B	quite difficult selection of parsnip slices
A	but anyway I got
B	sort of
B	it's a bit of panelling really
A	was good
C	I went a bit overboard with our nut roast making it like completely friendly to everybody but actually only us ate it in the end
C	vegan and gluten free but which consequently meant it didn't really hold together
A	oh
C	it tasted alright but
A	mm
C	but then only we ate it in the end anyway so
D	think my sister had a bit
unknown_female	mm
C	no because
D	yeah
C	we didn't like go to extreme lengths of cleaning everything
A	is it your sister who's gluten free?
C	mm
A	yeah
C	erm she's still doing the teaching thing in Hull
A	yeah
C	counting days literally until she can quit
A	oh
C	as if there wasn't enough work to do there
A	oh wow
C	she gets some special deal cos she's on this teach first scheme so
D	leadership
C	mm
A	she's gonna be a leader
C	mm
C	of the revolution hopefully
C	erm
A	or is it?
C	I think she wants to she wants to get out of that school
A	oh okay
C	I don't think she wants to stay in it for very long but I think she wants to try doing it a nicer school
A	I imagine it would make quite a big difference
C	mm
A	mm
C	in every way
A	it's good
unknown_female	yeah
A	I'm eating
B	yeah
A	duh duh duh
B	I didn't think I was cold
A	now you're warming up or?
B	it's like bits of me are going oh wait a minute?
A	you thawed?
C	sitting against the radiator as well
D	oh yeah I meant to do that
[ANNOTATION]	the radiator is hot	Neutral
C	we'll swap
D	no I'm
B	we're going back to your parents' weird phobia of central heating
C	oh
B	I think they don't know how to set it
A	like set the timing properly
B	yeah
C	mm
B	it's got one of those wheel things
C	oh like we've got?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the parents like central heating	Contradiction
C	mm
B	but I had a look at it just before we left
C	mm
B	and it's set as if it came out the shop
C	oh no way
B	like everything's in perfect corners
A	I don't know about that
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	central heating is more efficient	Neutral
A	can't be that lame
B	I dunno
C	there's like there's quite a lot of like research been done into energy behaviours about this kind of thing there's like a period of time when you've got a new system or a new house that you get to know it and you try different things and stuff
B	that's it? yeah
[ANNOTATION]	there are researches on heating systems	Entailment
C	like then you don't bother
A	mm
C	well that's
B	yeah
A	mm
C	mm
B	erm cos it it's that the extension extension's awful
A	new extension for the garage
B	erm but then all rooms feel cold really really quickly as soon as
unknown_female	mm
B	whatever heating in them's gone off
[ANNOTATION]	the room temperature drops when the heating is off	Entailment
C	and so it's like
A	cos
B	there's there's like
C	so they do fiddle but not in a sensical way?
B	there's never just
[ANNOTATION]	the central heating system heats multiple rooms	Entailment
[ANNOTATION]	central heating heats every room	Entailment
A	mm
B	yeah but it's just like
A	mm
B	it's too hot in here I'll turn the radiator off
unknown_female	mm
B	sort of ten degrees and the other ones are at twenty that you're
B	no heating or all the doors are shut to it
A	it's like my mum said she doesn't like the heating coming on in the morning she doesn't like it to get like hot in the bedroom
C	mm
A	she's in
C	but they could just turn the radiator off in the bedroom
B	that's what makes you think
A	but then wouldn't you just turn the one off in the bedroom and then have the rest of the house get warm
B	or
A	for the
B	yeah
A	morning
B	and that's what makes me think they don't know how to set it properly because you would be able to set it to not come in the morning and just come on in the afternoon if you wanted to
B	but I mean our
A	I don't know parents be crazy
B	I did try and understand their heating system previously but it was just like there's there's eight times the amount of copper here that there needs to be I don't have a clue what's going on
A	your parents are kind of funny as well
B	my parents are exactly the same
C	yeah
A	not quite in the world of heating but
B	yeah
D	the nature of parents
C	mm mm
C	indeed
C	oh
B	mm
A	oh
B	I think the the last couple of days just descended into a bit of a free-for-all
C	oh is it actually the end now properly?
B	he's ended at his
C	oh is it actually the end now properly?
B	he's gone
A	yeah he's
C	oh
A	properly retired well
B	so he's ended up with another tool chest like that one I've got in my basement
C	oh
B	full of spanners
C	right
B	he's just like er no one seemed to want it so I just put it in the car
B	how on earth did you put that in the car? I can't even lift it off the ground
A	but like random
C	determination of
A	like at that dinner service like there's like he's got
B	cos he's got he's taken like everything well he's not taken all of it but he's taken everything from the canteen
A	guess it's just stuff from the canteen or something
C	wow
B	which is like a nineteen sixties canteen so it's got
C	it's really cool
A	like weird
B	like yeah
C	oh I love all that stuff
B	yeah
A	it's true
B	but that ironically my brother was like oh we've only got four spoons we won't have enough spoons
B	and my dad was like oh I've got like thirty
unknown_female	oh
B	yeah but no I'm saying that's quite good
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	he did try and force those quite ugly crystal glasses onto us
C	oh nice
A	but we managed to resist
B	they were they were probably very expensive fancy
C	mm yeah
A	but but they just look quite ugly
C	yeah they don't usually look that nice
A	mm
C	do they? mm
A	and because of the expensiveness we wouldn't use them so they wouldn't erm
C	mm
B	well we took got a nice
C	mm
B	erm
D	a good acquisition
B	yeah
C	mm
A	I do
C	a hundred metres wow you can like tape out some sprint runs
B	yeah
A	yeah

A	erm I could try the green
A	you might like it
C	green?
A	yeah sure
C	okay
B	that's what my stove did to me
C	huh
D	mm
C	er er er
D	mm
C	stove fights back
D	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
B	the the the stove was like the inanimate party in this
D	it doesn't mean it doesn't get any blame
A	no
B	I did excellently
D	ah
B	boom
A	oh
D	oh
D	I'm gonna
B	yeah the additional
A	shall I bring the mulberry things to go with them?
D	yeah
A	or should I have kept plates for things?
D	keeping my plate for crumb related
A	oh well
B	I'm gonna use this I'm gonna use this small paper box kind of thing
D	eighteen volt?
B	that came
D	aha
B	Bosch
B	I think you would
D	mm
B	but has like like a basically a big Dremel
D	right
B	that was like mm
D	so it's quite small disks it takes?
B	er no it was just like small like rods
D	oh right
B	yeah
D	yeah?
B	didn't know quite how useful that would be
D	well like a dye grinder or something
B	yeah I couldn't really think when I'd want to use it
D	I imagine that would be quite useful
B	that much
D	the Dremel er metal working
B	big and powerful enough yeah
D	mm
D	and you can get some good aggressive like tungsten burr type things that
B	yeah yeah
D	are quite good for shaping
B	yeah
D	band saw what
B	yeah literally a band saw about that big that you can just
D	I think they I'm really like interested in that I think it might be really good for ripping
B	so that's what I was thinking
D	like really big planks cos you can't manoeuvre a big plank to a band saw but you can
B	no
D	easily
B	but I have a sneaking
unknown_female	no
unknown_female	no
D	what's going on? what?
C	there's not really enough cocoa for a hot chocolate
D	yeah that's almost enough anyway
C	alright
C	d'you like them?
D	yeah
B	the chocolate mulberries were
unknown_female	mm
B	yeah so I was looking at I was thinking well in theory the the cutting face bit
D	mm
B	as long as it's got enough power to
D	yeah
B	but I was just wondering it's sort of like quite a lot of friction and stuff but like it's quite tight bends to get it into a hand-built unit
D	yeah
B	I just don't know I can imagine if
C	this stuff's really nice
B	it's basically a an electronic hacksaw isn't it for metal stuff? is what I'm imagining people using it for rather than rip cutting a massive piece of wood
D	oh
C	like flavours when you
D	like
B	it really wasn't really wasn't that big
D	so you couldn't like have a plank like that and
B	no
D	I'm sure I've seen ones like that though
B	no
D	but whether they're corded
B	mm
D	oh yeah
B	they've made a cordless one of those as well by the looks of it
B	yes
D	yeah so
B	in fact I would say it's probably almost as useful as the drill
D	wow
B	just in terms of it's the thing that you most likely in my head it's the thing you're most likely to cut through the cable of
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah I mean I yeah I very very rarely use my cordless circular saw
D	oh right why's that then?
B	dunno it's just it hasn't got quite enough oomph
D	yeah
B	it's just got you've got all that
D	yeah without a guide they're like
B	yeah
D	circular saws they're just a bit of a nightmare in a way
B	yeah so yeah it really can't cope with it the depth of cut on it er and if it if it even if
D	mm
B	yeah
D	right
B	that didn't like doing it whereas the jigsaw will just fill you know?
D	cut through
B	yeah
D	yeah click saws are pretty great
B	mm
D	making a stove
B	yeah
D	cut as fast
B	on the
D	yeah
B	yeah erm B and Q's got a sale on
B	I only mentioned it cos they had some quite long SDS drill bits and I was considering getting some long ones
D	right
B	but they also had a flipping massive core drill
unknown_female	tea concoction
D	like diamond core drill?
B	yeah
D	oh right
B	was like thirty odd quid
A	aha
A	gonna have
C	the remainder of my sherry
B	double tea bag action what is going on here?
C	well I was just getting the leftover of those two teas
D	mm
A	mm
C	is it good?
D	it's so good I might have to dip a muffin in it
A	oh this looks nice
B	mm
A	maybe I'll combine it with a bit of
C	they
B	mm mine with the mulberry was an an excellent choice yeah
A	oh oh yeah
C	put a couple of mulberries on there
A	that sounds good
C	those are great those things
A	mm
C	I've never seen them anywhere in
A	I don't actually know yeah
C	yeah that's all
A	I don't know where it came from
C	probably
D	was it a present?
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't be surprised if they're in the shop at
C	mm
A	oh
B	they
C	mm
C	I still never been in there
B	it's really good
A	mm you should go in there
B	it was it was genuinely really good it was like oh this is probably the widest range of vegetarian items
C	mm
B	in
A	and it's yeah
B	but they also had like nice bread
unknown_female	mm
B	it had all that Nom er Welsh chocolate
C	oh right
B	stuff
C	mm
B	freezers were well stocked
A	and the café's meant to be alright I think
C	cool
B	café was
C	mm
D	mm oh yeah
B	two thumbs up
C	mm mm
D	say these were a bit nicer than the ones your sister had
D	they were for some reason they were all really like pathetically small your sister's ones
C	mm they're bigger ones these ones
A	so
C	no well I dunno really
D	they've got sort of punch about them
B	no
D	yeah
A	so what?
C	they look a totally different colour but
A	what do they look like fresh?
D	it's cos they're covered in chocolate
unknown_female	oh yeah
C	mm
B	well I
A	er
B	like a beech nut casing but bigger doesn't it? which these look absolutely nothing like
A	I don't really know
D	does it? I just thought it looked like a berry
C	mm
B	yeah
C	google picture of mulberry
B	mm
unknown_female	mm
D	double chocolate
C	I'm gonna put them inside
A	your parents' house is never short of wine or chocolate
D	which which parents?
D	ah
C	mm
A	which is good
B	although again we had to go and buy beer
D	outrageous
C	mm
C	disgraceful
A	just keep the good wine
D	it's true my parents give the most awful of any alcoholic beverages
D	if there are any there'll be the cheapest horriblest ones you can imagine
C	now they look like oversized blackberries stroke raspberries
B	ah I'm evidently wrong then
A	okay
B	what am I thinking of then?
C	mm
B	what am I thinking of?
A	erm
C	tayberries
A	of er medlars
B	that's what I'm thinking of
C	medlars?
D	medlars?
B	yes I'm thinking of something completely different now that I think about it
unknown_female	mm
A	medlars
C	I don't know what they are
B	they're like
A	they're a slightly weird
C	do they grow here?
A	like they get called dogs' is it dogs' bums or something?
B	yeah
A	it's cos like the end of it it is kind of indented and it gives the impression of one
D	dog's bum
A	something like that or am I? I don't
B	yeah
A	but erm it's weird you have to let them slightly it's called bletting isn't it? is it they start to get slightly rotted or
B	yeah
A	fermented or something? and you you you you kind of have to let that happen and it actually like softens the fruit or does
C	mm
A	something and that's when they're best to pick apparently
C	mm
B	seems like one of those things it's like oh god there's so many rules and things like
C	mm
B	you have to plant the tree and then it like
C	mm
B	about
D	mm
C	mm
D	so we were supposed to give my parents the walnut tree
C	oh bummer
D	I brought two presents back for
C	mm
D	they're in the car
C	mm
D	one of them's a clothing item the other one's a clothing item
D	er
D	no but there'll probably be like a fleece nest or something
C	anyway socks
D	no
D	lovely snickers
unknown_female	lovely snickers?
A	what are your what are your parents like at at present choosing giving?
D	mm fairly awful
A	it's true
C	occasionally they'll come out with something useful
D	what have they given you versus me?
C	they gave me that terrible fleece
C	for my birthday
D	get in there
A	do you want half the muffin?
D	I'm on my second
B	I could eat half
C	oh a hit
D	yeah
C	for
D	feel like I
C	and hardly any sugar
D	not any fat? what was that all about?
B	ah
unknown_female	well
B	there's part of me thinking what's the point of eating it now?
D	exactly
B	it's like
C	well it's got lots of cranberries in it and banana good for you
D	ah
D	banana
C	it's hidden banana cos it
B	it's well hidden banana
C	cos it was gone way past the point where I like them
C	cos I need to hide them
A	that banana bread beer was strange have you tried that one?
B	oh that that?
C	mm? banana bread beer?
B	mm
C	mm
A	erm
B	in my non-banana opinion
D	doesn't sound very good
A	so
C	mm
A	like a like an ale er yeah
B	it was like an ale with a banana dipped in it it was like that
A	me me and
B	a lot more accurately it was like a beer with a Refresher bar
C	mm
A	it did have that slightly
D	interesting
unknown_female	that
A	slightly
D	but like that sounds a bit nicer somehow
A	I know but that kind of artificial banana flavour
B	yeah
C	that's even worse than banana
D	banana-y real banana
C	mm
D	you were devouring them
C	they were quite nice after a bit
D	yeah
D	and then you just kept eating them
D	nice
C	I like the texture of them
D	mm me too they remind me of er
C	they were sort of
D	mango things
C	mm
D	dried mango
C	they were like dried banana chip but they weren't like those crunchy chip ones they were sort of chewy a bit toffee-ish
A	okay
B	mm okay
A	I think we got the worst present from my brother
B	yes
D	what was it?
B	World Of Warcraft expansion pack
A	well no just a terrible like must've been on offer in Boots toiletry section
C	oh no
A	so
B	I I
A	and I got something
C	no
A	and then a
A	clearly re-gifted bottle of really bad white wine that they don't drink
A	wine so they just thought they'd give it to us and er
B	but it looks like
A	and we put effort in and we'd bought them that Qwirkle game we were describing earlier
A	and it was just like god
C	mm
B	yes er
D	toiletries
C	mm that is really bad
A	just ironic cos when me and my brother were younger and then you know he used to get bought a lot of Lynx box sets and we would you know go on about this how it was really crap and he would end up with like five
A	and now and now he's he's started to give them out it's just ah
C	that's all wrong
B	I don't even think they were on special offer at Boots I think they were just probably on the end of the aisle at the supermarket
D	sure it's not just one they'd had for years
C	mm
D	cos he'd
C	mm
A	maybe
B	it's the flavour of peace
D	what Lynx?
B	mm
C	if that's the flavour of peace then
B	oh that's where I
C	oh dear
B	I I can that's where I can use it up I'm gonna come down and just spray it in front of the peace choir and
A	oh no no
A	ah
D	I think that would be quite amusing
B	ah I would wanna get like
A	they will all hate you a lot
B	I wanna get the opinion that I'm
A	like
B	and then the peace choir can tell me if it smells of peace
B	in body deodorant form
C	I've got a feeling some of the peace choir might get violent
D	that would
D	yeah
C	raar raging hippies
D	yes
A	ah
D	that'd be a good advert at the start of the cinema
A	yeah
unknown_female	ah
B	no I'm not entirely sure what peace smells of
B	one of those things I'd have quite happily just dropped it straight in the bin if it wasn't
D	pressurised
B	to get some sort of use out of it
A	cos Lynx is just associated with I dunno gangs of like eighteen year-old boys in Ben Sherman shirts and I can't I can't see
D	it's very true
A	I can't see the association with peace
B	no
C	mm
B	I dunno it's widening their vocabulary at least
C	it was quite funny actually my sister like didn't do an amazing job with some of the presents in that are you thinking like
A	ah
C	which we didn't even put on the
C	maybe slightly too harshly
D	no it was alright it was better to to do that cos they've
C	yeah
D	took it away with them now
C	yeah that's true
C	no can't remember what there was there was some other sort of sweet things I mean I'm just sort of thinking
D	er come on it wasn't bad it was quite good
C	it wasn't that bad no no yeah yeah but it was like mead
D	that's pretty much as sweet as you can get on the drinking front
unknown_female	yeah
B	you need a lot of gin to
C	yeah
A	I reckon Baileys is like sweeter than mead
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	and whether the creaminess helps
D	yeah the creaminess does help
C	the creaminess does help
D	creamy mead
C	mm
A	cream every day
B	is it big enough to put your head in?
A	did you have some extravagant hot chocolates with cream on top?
C	mm
D	down there
D	yeah
D	like yeah yeah
unknown_female	mm
D	the guy goes like oh
A	oh
D	just assumed he was gonna go off to the fridge and get like you know just a an average tub out and he just came back with this massive ice cream thing full of clotted cream
A	well
D	we were like mm mm great
A	that was like your best present I should imagine
C	his face was something
D	that was a pretty excellent present
D	it was quite unexpected
C	mm yeah cos like wow how much d'you want for that? and he was like no just take it
D	erm pretty much I do sort of go there or have been going there most Fridays
C	we decided to cement it by giving him a Christmas card
B	oh crikey
C	saying thank you for the yummy milk
B	thanks like you know beyond family member-ish did we actually send any Christmas cards slash did you send any that I wasn't aware of?
A	yes
B	there we go then
C	I made it completely random who got Christmas cards from us this year
C	had some surprise messages go oh thanks for the Christmas card
C	don't usually get one what where's where d'you like? like
B	we did have a couple of those where it's like a text message where do you live and you reply back saying now send me yours
B	and they don't and you're like oh
unknown_female	oh
C	mm
D	mm
C	do you wanna play a game?
D	erm
C	we have two exciting new games
D	do we?
C	yeah
D	what are they?
C	we've got Jungle Speed Safari
A	woah
D	I could just about cope with Jungle Speed Safari the other one's a bit like long and thinky
C	oh okay
B	okay
C	like you win together or you die together
A	like everyone?
C	yeah
D	remember we had a good game of what was it what was it called the
C	Cosmic Encounters or something
D	oh Cosmic Encounters that was quite good we
C	there's
D	it's aliens and kind of meet other species and negotiate with them or attack them and blah blah blah blah
D	and
C	I was I was erm a race called the Cudgels which made me
D	special powers like
C	so we went for one mega smash then everybody hated us forever and we didn't have any more good cards so that was the end of that basically
B	yes
B	well your parents still didn't get it
A	no it's just my mum
D	what was that?
B	the
D	oh right
B	the one with the big
D	your mum didn't get it
B	one and a half rules
D	yeah well well I get it and I didn't even see any of the pieces and
C	yeah
B	yeah I managed to explain it to
unknown_female	oh
A	it's just like tiles with different shapes of different colours like
C	right
B	that's not the correct way of explaining it
B	it's Scrabble but with colours and shapes rather than words
D	actually it's very much like the Mensa game
C	is it like the Mensa game? yeah
D	only with you know shapes and colours
C	right
D	rather than just the shapes
C	yeah
D	but
A	I think Scrabble's misleading cos there's not a board
C	no
D	that was my only confusion when
B	but that did make me think I could make a Qwirkle board
D	you could have
B	that would add add complexity to it in the future
D	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
D	that you wanna get or not
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	mm
unknown_female	mm
B	mm
unknown_female	mm
D	that could be
B	so it's
D	the add on pack
B	it could be
C	mm
B	yes
C	expansion pack
B	cos then all we need is a hundred and four or a hundred and eight can't remember what three times thirty-six is
A	a hundred and eight
C	yeah
B	so we just need a hundred and eight identical bits of tile
D	yeah
B	and we can make
D	are they square?
B	yes
unknown_female	yeah
B	tiles yeah
D	cos you could do it with
B	yeah you could make different
D	but yeah square ones
B	but hexagonal does add a lot more work
D	square would be much easier
B	yes
C	okay
D	okay
C	I'm gonna turn this off now
C	not that we can't keep talking
A	so does your erm Star Trek watching?
