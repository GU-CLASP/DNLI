A	so your dad rang a couple of hours ago
B	got there alright then?
A	yes he texted me last night probably about half eleven to say they were there
B	mm
A	well your dad said it's horrendous it's going to take forever he says they haven't got end caps for a start they've been nicked or they've fallen off or they didn't come with them which is a problem that we always used to have erm there's a big box of like rubber end caps but they can't make them fit so your dad had gone out to get more calor gas from a local shop because they are using like a a Canusa type torch to melt down the rubber to try and get it to stick onto the pipe so
B	oh
A	almost like welding it on
B	it was lovely up there yesterday
A	well yeah once they do get on to site that's when they need somebody else there to record the delivery notes correctly
B	oh
A	you know a pipe is a pipe they've gotta they've gotta flush it through before they use it anyway you have to you know bung water through at high pressure which cleans out all the rubbish tests all the joints I mean that's standard procedure and I am assuming it's a drinking water pipe if it's sewerage well there's even less need to
B	mm
A	well he's probably thinking it is not necessarily not necessary but it is just him and
B	yeah
A	so
B	who's that?
A	he's the guy that used to supply goods to FTD and then has joined us now and he's very much upstairs with the upstairs mentality of the them and us he's in the upstairs team
B	oh right
A	oh
B	lunch
A	oh fair enough
B	half past two
A	oh did he oh so he might wake up soon?
B	mm in the car
A	it's taken you that long to get here?
B	yeah
A	roadworks
B	it was the roadworks
A	where are they?
B	erm so if you come from

A	Balti there's a Balti restaurant you've gone past the the school yeah?
B	yeah you've had gone past that

B	mm
A	mm
B	yeah for ages
A	the roadworks are still in
B	yeah I thought they was still there
A	mm yeah but they are only erm you know two way now not four way so it doesn't take as long

B	what kind of holiday?
A	oh
B	yeah late so this year so you are talking about all this year?
A	oh yeah yeah I'm talking about I'm talking about April I'm talking about I can't wait for the sun
B	yeah so yeah so let's just in April because you know we've got bags of cash
A	well Iceland
B	well that's it then we can't possibly afford to do another one
A	okay
B	I bought a christening outfit
A	you are out I'll see if
B	oh no on your own
A	mm
A	no I know
B	it's ratatat
A	oh
B	no I said ratatat is the rabbit in Rhythm Time
A	oh that what just like that?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	but he's got Rhythm Time on his hat so he's about twenty pound more expensive
A	oh I see
B	yeah
A	Rhythm Time is a franchised business isn't it?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah I think I might take him to baby signing
A	excellent and nanny needs to come as well
B	well if you just if take them and
A	why do you want him to learn that?
B	well then by the time there's apparently a lady was telling me today that er a woman takes her daughter and she's
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	how clever
B	mm mm
A	BSL or Makaton?
B	I don't know
A	he does Makaton does he?
B	yeah
A	I'd like to come if it was BSL where do you where do they do that?
B	great
A	oh that church
B	yes I think they do it in there I don't know how much it is actually maybe I I will have a look now because I would quite like to go to that
A	oh okay
B	well obviously what I'm going to leave him am I?
B	yeah bye
A	he doesn't need to sign he just screams
B	what do you mean just screams? what to tell me what he wants?
A	mm
B	yeah but the crying is gonna get less and if he can communicate with me in another way in a few months' time surely that's beneficial to the way
A	and then and then they're gonna say oh my baby doesn't talk it just signs because he just decided he doesn't need to
A	well no that just they don't need to
B	of course they need to
A	no no I'm thinking that will be what somebody will come up with next somebody will say that because because er
B	yeah
A	there you go
B	you may worry that teaching your baby to sign will slow down his normal speech development in fact research shows the opposite is true signing may actually help your baby to learn to talk adding words to his vocabulary signing is about enhancing not replacing language
A	yes
B	oh if for example he tells you he can hear an aeroplane you can respond you hear an aeroplane yes I can see it look it's over there it's in the
A	right
B	no
A	interesting what what day is that on?

A	oh right okay
B	erm put your fingers to your lips food or go move your hand palm up backwards and forwards is that all?
A	yes
B	happy draw an exaggerated smile with your mouth with a finger while smiling
A	oh you see that's happy

B	yeah
A	well no I said well we'll have to have a meeting about it then
B	a meeting how official
B	yes
A	because for a start it will need to be fairly central you don't want to be miles away from like the tour that we wanted to do and I don't know where it is situated so things like that we will need to look at surely
B	no
A	well and it and what the car hire costs would be because erm
B	it is I know
B	but that's like
A	yeah you see yes that's what I mean
B	yeah
A	and you've probably got bed and breakfast in the hotel so that's your breakfast sorted so that's why I mean we need to have a little meeting and I I said to

A	well he doesn't turn seventeen for er for a month so
B	well you can't really August September October
A	that's pushing it
B	you can't really guarantee that he's gonna be done in that three months
A	no no
B	yeah no
A	well there's a lot to think about when you are taking a group isn't it that's the thing
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B is travelling alone	Contradiction
B	yes definitely

A	oh
B	isn't that exciting?
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker B is tutoring advanced maths	Contradiction
B	would work as a square so if you've got I don't know sixty-three add twenty-five
A	mm
B	yeah
A	yeah why do you learn like that? well I suppose that's how you do it in your head then isn't it?
B	yeah
A	then you just see you progress from leaving the square behind
B	yeah
A	oh I see it's just
B	so once they see that sixty-three add twenty is eighty-three and then they can do that quickly in their head
A	right I see they just
B	yeah we are doing
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Not all operations are easy to be executed in mind.	Neutral
B	they've got to I'm going to ask them oh what's yeah what's thirty-three add ten and then I'm just going to see straightaway
A	right
B	so we will see
A	okay
[ANNOTATION]	63 plus 20 is 90.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
B	it's like a lounge and going back into a a dining room probably the ground floor is not much bigger than this lounge
A	yeah
B	because you go in and get straight into the
A	what and that there's a kitchen
B	yeah it's at the back
A	oh it has because that kitchen we looked at in that that house when I was looking at ones for you
B	which house?
[ANNOTATION]	There is no kitchen room in place.	Contradiction
A	the one you sent me to look at first of all for you and I think you did go and
B	oh yeah that one oh that was horrible wasn't it?
A	was there was there no window in that kitchen was there? nor was there one at the front and I don't think there was it just it was like a room you went into
B	what was behind it then?
A	I'm just trying to remember I don't think I don't think it had a window in it
B	oh you let it get like that
A	there's was waste they had to did they have the the downstairs toilet there in a little hallway?
B	yeah you went in and it was a little hall and you go to the garage or you had the
A	that's right
B	where would you put your sofa?
A	that's right
B	where would you put your TV? because there was no TV point there it was like over there your dining space was quite nice because you had a big the big french doors but yeah then you had the tiny little kitchen
A	and your dining table you couldn't could you
[ANNOTATION]	The first place was very unpleasant.	Entailment
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it was nice to have that and then you felt you were going into something bigger but it was a bit pointless because there was nothing else there then was there?
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B did not want to search for a smaller place.	Entailment
A	mm
B	and then yeah she would have had a a big lounge dining room at the back and then that kitchen I don't know why why it was so small they could have brought it out to the stairs and had a bigger room which is odd
A	no yours is better way it's erm proportioned
B	we've all
A	mm
B	yeah
A	so you really lost the space because they they were small
B	yeah they were tiny yeah the bedrooms
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B only wanted small rooms.	Contradiction
A	mind you that
B	oh yeah
A	no no you are not not that particular one I'm thinking just to use the actual space you've got because our house before in
B	ah
