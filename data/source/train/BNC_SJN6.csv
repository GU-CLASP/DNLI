B	right what's on your mind?
A	right
B	young man?
A	the issue er that er I'm I'm currently in the process of marking the second years' work
B	ah well don't mention any
A	well it's all
B	don't mention any names
A	no of course not
B	that'll be okay
A	of course erm it's all so it's all er
B	yeah
B	yes
A	right
B	now it depends whether all the questions are of equal weight are they?
A	they're fifty fifty yes
B	okay that's
A	yeah
B	how many there are two questions?
A	two questions fifty yeah
B	alright
B	you have two options one you could mark each question with the usual forty-two forty-five
A	uhu
B	forty-eight
A	which is er that's
B	yeah
A	that's
B	yeah
A	what I have done
B	then you add up the two
A	yes
B	and then
A	right okay yeah
B	okay now
A	cos that's er so I've got
B	but hang on a minute hang on a minute
A	right
B	that will never produce anything that requires rounding up because it won't be in fractions the only rounding up happens is when you
A	uhu
B	forty-eight point five goes
A	yes
B	to the forty-nine
A	right
B	you don't
A	but
B	you do not round up forty-nine to fifty
A	right but because the department has the the boundaries you know the erm er from the coursework so it's like seventy-five sixty-eight those
B	yeah yeah
A	so the
B	right
A	added together divided by two brings out seventy-one point five
B	okay yeah when you have the coursework and the exam that will produce then you do er round up
A	yeah
B	and that gives you
A	to seventy-five
B	yes
A	right
B	well hang on a minute
A	er
B	okay
A	and I think it's seventy-one point five? I think
B	oh seventy-one point five?
A	seventy-one
B	yes seventy-two I thought you said
A	yeah
B	seventy-five
A	no
B	oh yeah yeah yeah that's seventy-two no problem
A	so it's
B	yeah yeah
A	so so seventy-two
B	yeah
A	is is
B	yeah
A	fine
B	is what you put down
A	it doesn't have to be seventy-five you know because of the
B	oh I see what you mean
A	the do you see what I mean? the
B	no no no no no no no
A	yeah
B	no no no
A	no just
B	no no no no
A	just a whole number?
B	just a whole number whatever that
A	right
B	whole number whether that whole number exists in our marking scheme or not
A	is irrelevant?
B	is irrelevant
A	super right
B	alright good
A	okay that's
B	otherwise yeah you'd be really inflating
A	yeah
B	the scores
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	no that's what I
B	okay
A	that's what I
B	that's right
A	that was my concern
B	yes so
A	and
B	hang on what's
A	I I I
B	these last ten years then?
B	oh god and I suppose all those
A	yeah
B	firsts two years ago
B	oh my heavens
A	so yes
B	yes
A	okay
B	what are you doing it on?
A	well
B	what are you examining on?
A	oh well it's er individual differences yeah so
B	so our
A	yeah
B	second year lot
A	the second year
B	and how are they looking?
A	I'm quite impressed actually yeah yeah
B	well that's good to hear
A	yeah there's erm I mean they're obviously they've tended to go for certain questions
B	yes
A	over
B	sure
A	over over others and er you know but
B	blimey
A	yeah
B	well that's impressive
A	yeah
B	erm
A	no I mean even some of the students that perhaps we wouldn't expect
B	well yeah yeah
A	to do as well
B	yeah
A	have have erm yeah
B	well I
A	yeah
B	in the Cs
A	right okay
B	largely in the Cs so
A	or maybe it's a
B	okay
A	so
B	if they knew the material
A	yeah
B	okay well
A	mm
B	er
A	yeah
B	just haven't had the time to do that
A	and I think
B	well
A	erm er
B	er
A	yes
B	analysis
A	oh absolutely yeah
B	of something
A	yeah yeah
B	right er because the student otherwise will just simply reproduce as it were what he she knows about X
A	yes I know
B	er now sometimes you can do it by putting in that word in the title critically
A	yes
B	evaluate the contribution of Z to
A	yes
B	you know whatever er but if you don't then it you might well get these fairly voluminous answers er which you might feel obliged to give marks to because the volume is there
A	yeah
B	but if they don't have the critical analysis
A	the that's right now I mean erm
B	right
A	er
B	and did they in fact
A	some
B	critically evaluate?
A	and the good students did
B	okay
A	the
B	right
A	the er less capable tended to just sort of a give you a
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	er and and er if they did that proficiently with
B	alright okay
A	if they if they demonstrated extra reading erm and the you know it was er they they clearly understood they had a decent structure and stuff like that then they were moved up higher that was the sort of
B	how high would you go on that kind of
A	I don't think I
B	material?
A	I I went any higher than sort of giving seventy-five
B	er how how many seventy-fives did you give?
A	not
B	okay
A	not
B	alright
A	sort of
B	okay yeah
A	not a a
B	alright
A	massive proportion there was quite a few sort of Bs B pluses
B	okay alright
A	but but er but there was also a fair few
B	we've said this to each other
A	yeah
B	before about this particular cohort you know
A	yeah
B	they got the mark er and that mark is a I'm sure a pass mark
A	yeah
B	so good luck to them
A	absolutely
B	and with the probably inevitably better coursework
A	yes yeah well the coursework was a bit more of a mixed bag so that's it so I I think I
B	really?
A	rather than the coursework
B	that's extremely unusual
A	yeah because the
B	okay
A	with the sort of material
B	okay
A	they were
B	mm
A	but the ones that did less well in the coursework
B	well it could be just
B	regression to the mean I mean there is
A	oh it oh it's yeah
B	an element of that of course
B	I mean there is usually a correlation between the two er I er I used to do that sometimes correlate it
A	yeah correlate it yeah
B	yeah it's
A	yeah
B	it's pretty high it's not anything like point seven point eight
A	no
B	it's our old friend the point threes
A	yeah
B	you know the
A	yeah
B	about that
A	er quantitative just finishing off that quantitative
B	what's that looking like?
A	and and their
B	I would imagine that's
B	even more varied and more of a
A	that is
B	spread
A	that's that's it's a tricky one because they're they have all done completely different things
B	okay
A	so but but
B	ooh er
A	or you know they and so they
B	yeah yeah
A	and you know they've
B	yes yes
A	some of them have taken it and and done
B	yeah yeah
A	whereas others have just some of them have just done an alpha reliability and said you know here it is
A	erm which is good you know which is
B	yeah yeah alright yeah yeah
A	you which is better than the ones that haven't
B	that that
A	done it
B	haven't done it at all yes
A	you know you
A	er er and and and
B	well I suppose that's true
A	and so er
B	alright
A	you know and then then some people have looked at you know their literature review is very substantial
B	yeah
A	others mm
B	no
A	not so much and
B	not so much
A	and er and so it's er
A	it's it's
B	well you remember cudgelling these very same students last year
A	yeah
B	into writing a lab report
A	oh
B	so you'd kind of
A	absolutely
B	hope that they'd have got it in the end but
A	I
B	possibly
A	that's right I know
A	and and mm by and large they are
B	oh right well there's
A	but
B	an achievement from all of us
B	isn't it?
A	but er
B	well I suppose to give them some excuse this has been a year not it's not a year it's been six months between since their last lab report
A	uhu
B	because they've been in doing quali in the first semester
A	yeah sure yeah yeah
B	so okay
A	yeah that's
B	and they how
A	it's just the one
B	oh well
A	I think is
B	okay
A	yeah yeah just er
B	er whereas they did five
A	well the
B	at the other
A	that's right yeah no it's just that's it it's just the one project that
B	yeah
A	that that is a accumulation of the whole year's
B	yeah yeah
A	so
A	yeah
B	having less time to assess
A	yeah
B	and we know that if we well it's an old story isn't it? if we asked them to do it just for a practice they just wouldn't do it
A	no
B	well at least
A	that's right
B	some of them would
A	yeah yes
B	but the ones that need it
A	the
B	wouldn't do it
A	yes absolutely absolutely and er and erm
B	there's a contrastive coming up next
A	there's
B	isn't there?
A	yeah
B	whereas
B	on the other hand
A	erm
B	oh please
A	and then you say well
B	well look
A	er
B	it's fifty percent
B	of your mark
A	do do you actually
B	it's a substantial piece
A	understand that
B	yeah right
A	you know
B	yeah
A	do you think we covered er
B	cos I thought you just liked it sir
B	just for fun
A	just just for
B	cos we enjoy it so much
A	I mean hey that's you know we're getting a bit philosophical now maybe
B	yeah
A	this is what it's all about maybe
B	about that's right
A	a look but
A	but it's er
A	er yeah no I'll you know sort of
B	yeah
A	there's only so much you can say
B	okay
A	this might be a little bit of the
B	yes yes quite
A	yeah so
B	well they will all have at least I hope all will have got the message that they'll need this oh well that's not true because some of them bail out on method on the premise that they don't like this method they're never gonna use
A	uhu
B	again
A	yes
B	and certainly not in their dissertation
A	yes
B	so they bail out early and then it's difficult
A	yeah
B	er
A	that's right yeah I think
B	okay
A	to do it
B	they should have all the tools
A	they they're they
B	to do it but
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I mean whether or not they can er
B	well you remember what happened last year when they would knock on the door
A	yeah
B	at any opportunity er well it seemed to us at
A	yes
B	every opportunity but maybe maybe that we're overestimating on the basis of the vividness of some experiences
A	mm
B	and the majority of those even that did quantitative just got on with it and did it themselves either with their
A	sure
B	supervisor's help or with
A	or with
B	maths
A	yeah yeah
B	er remedial classes
A	yeah
B	or whatever it might be
A	that's right yeah
B	in the maths centre which is just down the road and it's er I think to their credit some of them used it
A	they did yeah yeah absolutely er erm
B	the difficulty next year is that we're gonna have less members of staff
A	mm
A	uhu
B	that means and depending on who we take on for the
A	absolutely
B	new appointments
A	yeah
B	who may be probationers
A	yes yeah
B	who may not have
A	no
B	enough
A	yeah
B	hours in their teaching allocation to do dissertations it might be four of us
A	yeah
B	with sixty
A	blimey
B	people
A	phew
B	so I'll be
A	that's
B	sending some stuff down to
A	so yeah
B	and load up
A	yeah
B	with some dissertation proposals
A	yeah that's
B	and just er
A	that's that's how you
B	see if you can find a
A	yeah
B	a buyer
A	yeah
B	anywhere on on the
A	yeah that's
B	M69
A	that's er well that's I usually can yeah
A	er
A	er it
B	on that score how are you doing in terms of looking around for things?
B	okay
A	first
B	okay
A	you know and then
B	that's fair enough
A	and and and and
B	okay
A	you know
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	if if something comes up and I think oh that that that would suit me
B	right
A	and then
B	yeah
A	then I would go for it but
B	sure
A	the the thesis is the er
B	oh that's absolutely right well it must be right
A	yeah
B	er how could it be otherwise? you will be
A	once I've got that sort of you know
B	and how how close are you are you to submission?
A	fairly well mm
B	good
A	it could
B	okay
A	I I was hoping it would be earlier than that
B	yeah
A	but with taking on the teaching et cetera that's it has it has pushed me back
B	yeah okay
A	but it's but it
B	fair enough well if you can use the the holiday er sorry you know not
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	They have submitted their thesis	Contradiction
B	maybe not have a holiday
A	yes that's
B	and use the summer
A	that's my plan
[ANNOTATION]	B has written a thesis and submitted it	Neutral
B	just to
A	just to use the summer just to
B	yeah yeah
A	to to finish it all off and
B	and as I'm sure your supervisor telling you just don't be so perfectionist about it just get it done
A	no no I'm I am I'm learning that it's just er it's just got to be good enough
B	yeah yeah bullet points er for you should be fine I think
A	yeah I've
B	yeah
A	I've written it all down back of
B	yeah
A	a fag packet
B	that's a much better
A	is that
[ANNOTATION]	B smokes	Neutral
B	in fact
B	that's right
B	perhaps with a with er were those you know networks of er you know what are they called? the you know I
A	the mind map things?
B	the mind map things
A	yeah yeah
B	that's right yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A is a smoker	Neutral
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	bullet points mind maps
B	yeah mind map
A	and a couple of illustrations as well
[ANNOTATION]	The thesis needs to be perfect	Contradiction
B	and you could say at the bottom of it sorry ran out of time
A	sorry ran out of ink
A	yeah er
A	and I I I couldn't I didn't wanna go and buy another pen so
B	that's right
A	tough
A	yeah
B	and I'm never gonna use this method again so
A	all in all in conclusion
A	can I have a PhD please?
B	well okay excellent
A	yeah
B	so end of the summer definitely hand it in that's you done
A	uhu
B	good super
A	so yeah right
B	we have our er exam board tomorrow so that should be interesting
A	mm
B	but this is for the
B	and this lot well your lot my lot
A	yeah
B	will go into next year and then we'll see how that goes
A	uhu
B	with as you know some things hanging over some of them that you know
A	yeah yeah erm
B	we shall see how that resolves itself
A	mm it's certainly er
B	it is
A	well er yeah
B	extremely unusual
A	yeah
B	let's hope you know it's a one-off
A	yeah yeah
B	right
A	mm mm right well I'm gonna
B	good
A	I'm gonna er do some maths
B	oh yes what fun I'll pass you the appropriate forms to fill out
A	oh absolutely yeah yeah
B	smashing thank you
A	cheers thanks
