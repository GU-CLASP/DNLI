B	how the other dog went and fetched him and
C	oh it's extraordinary that that I've never
B	friendship
C	I've never seen anything quite like
B	mm
C	I opened the door he jumped up straight into the seat
A	did he?
C	he can't see at all can he?
A	no
B	oh right
A	well he got
C	I know that
C	that's the thing the sofa

B	that's
A	yeah
B	those doors you said you wanted it for something
A	you said you want them doors yeah well you'll see em anyway
C	oh that's what I was thinking of putting the
B	you don't want them now do you?
C	well
A	yeah
C	but I've found a solution for the winter cos I just in my I just work in my lounge
A	well yeah it's the best thing
B	yeah
A	you can do
C	erm and that that's better than trying to heat up another area isn't it?
A	well of course it is yeah
C	erm
B	no
A	that
C	so
A	you can't get two
C	mm?
A	stuff? that's not toxic the stuff you use the
C	my
A	oh I see yeah
C	she says I really should have a erm a fume cabinet that exhausts out through a tube
A	oh I see
C	erm and I could build one of those quite simply actually
A	yeah
C	so I can
B	oh
C	erm sometimes my eye used to sting a little bit but
A	no
C	every time I've done a little glass with etching on for somebody for a wedding or something they love it you know
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	I did one for
A	yeah
B	mm
C	but well they couldn't do that and I didn't know about that what they wanted so I made just a little tank glass
B	yeah
C	and that apparently is in the middle of their mantelpiece and they and they think it's wonderful
B	yeah lovely
C	but the effort required
A	oh what the
A	we don't have one
A	no
C	no I bought that's where I bought these glasses from and they were really cheap
B	yeah glasses
C	I bought I bought a sort of a quite a stack of them I've still got some up in the loft
C	yeah Ikea
A	Ikea that's the one
C	and and then but then from the point of view I just draft it out cut out get a stencil with my sign writing stuff stick it on the glass
A	yeah
C	dig out a bit smooth it on smooth it on
B	oh
C	quarter of an hour
B	mm
C	cos that's that's not been used
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	you wipe it all off erm the
B	lovely
C	it's a lovely
A	well you do you get yeah
C	mm
A	well you'd have to wear a mask yeah
C	well everyone's always thrilled whenever I do one and it's so simple
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
C	erm
B	right
C	and erm
A	oh that's some kind of acid isn't it that's gotta be
C	yeah
A	an acid thing
C	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah
A	mm
C	I think it's nitric acid actually or something
B	you can wear a mask can't you?
C	I do
B	oh
C	yeah I do wear a little mask
A	yeah
B	that's alight
A	one one of them little face masks
C	mm but I couldn't find the goggles last time so I did em without the goggles my eyes did
C	so yeah why are we talking about that? cos I I
B	erm
C	what led on to that?
A	I don't know
C	I
A	oh yeah
B	no
C	they're small doors
A	we're talking about the doors that fit on units and stuff like that little kitchen unit things
C	I use
B	you you asked for er like a just a piece of wood really
C	oh that was for plonking my I
B	right yeah
C	I found the wires were long enough
A	oh I see yeah you weren't gonna
C	that that was
B	mm
C	quite amazing the
B	yeah
C	cos I tried first running erm from the phone outlet
A	yeah
C	there
A	oh I see yeah
C	and it worked
A	oh
C	and actually we found out that one of their speakers hadn't been working for years
A	mm
C	it was painted over and the last time that was painted was donkey's years ago
A	yeah
C	the other half had been eaten at some stage
A	we we've gotta chuck some speakers away did you want any speakers?
C	oh don't chuck speakers please
B	yeah
C	cos if I could fix up speakers in the church and just plug in that'd save me two things
A	just check
C	organist at York Minster
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and he erm he
B	oh
C	was started there the year I finished the job he was getting on a bit but erm he did one CD which is popular hymns
A	yeah
C	and then starts it
C	and it's beautifully done you could actually hear him moving the stocks
B	oh
C	it's MP3 so it plays on that
A	yes
C	online
A	yeah
C	and erm so I I did that for the hymns using these speakers
A	yeah
C	erm and then at the end we got right to the end and I played a voluntary
A	wow
B	oh
C	and the moment I stuck that on at the end of the service
A	yes
C	but when the voluntary came on
B	mm
C	he didn't associate that with anything electronic
A	oh
C	he said er who's playing the organ
A	oh
C	and isn't that lovely?
B	yeah
C	so it obviously suited because it's must've sounded like that little organ in there
A	oh
B	oh
C	yeah
A	how is he is he is he
C	oh yeah he's he's alright
A	is he?
C	he's a little bit uncertain on his feet
A	yeah
C	er
B	mm
C	or well actually about three hours last time I think
A	yeah
C	and erm so it's good to sit with
A	yeah
B	mm
A	you said you were gonna send me updates for the church you know
C	yes I well well what what I'd like to do
A	well that's it yeah
C	and I could leave them there that would be good and then I just
A	they about that big?
C	oh that's lovely I
B	we've got several actually I was
C	if I run the wires the wires to the back of the church
A	yeah
C	or just to where I'm sitting will be fine
A	yeah
C	where I normally sit to that pew
A	yeah
C	and then
A	they've got little flips and
C	oh that's superb so I just need just need to get some wire
C	any old
A	yeah
C	electrical wire would do that won't it?
A	well course it would

C	do you know isn't it often the way the older stuff was
A	yes yes
C	they're cutting corners to
B	yeah
C	you know they make it look swish but there may be is hardly anything inside

C	yeah
B	yeah
C	well that see that's what I started off doing
A	yeah
C	to so it was a totally different service so
A	yeah
C	that we could it was something different for them
A	I rigged that up right
C	mm
B	mm
A	to play in every room in the house bar the kitchen
C	mm
A	there's wires go underneath the coving
C	mm
A	all round the house
C	yeah
A	and out into the dairy
C	mm
A	so we could have the
C	so it go to the dairy as well?
A	that go to the dairy as well
B	mm
A	and we got great big speakers in the dairy

B	but we disconnected it
A	we did
C	mm
A	I can connect it up again
B	mm
A	that's no problem connect up again
B	yeah I suppose not no
C	did you label all the wires so you know where they go?
B	it goes out out the window
C	mm
B	mm
A	you sure you don't get that chest seen to?
C	no I just I just what I should've taken this morning is some Covonia

A	yeah
C	isn't she lovely?
B	mm
C	oh and but she was in an interview with someone
A	oh yeah in that interview room?
C	yeah
B	mm
C	and that Covonia loosens it
B	right
A	mm
C	and then whatever is still stuck there causes it
A	I don't understand how that work
B	mm
A	cos you swallow that you that don't go
C	yeah
A	down your that don't go down your windpipe that go down your
C	it it may be something to do with the vapours it gives off
A	it must be the vapours
B	yeah
C	and
A	this is why when we were kids
C	mm
A	mum used to put Vick
C	yeah
A	in the
C	hot water
A	in the pot of hot water and you used to sit over the top and
C	damp towel over your head
A	and breathe didn't you?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
A	I reckon that worked just as well as anything else
C	it wasn't it wasn't unpleasant really was it? but it and it
A	it made your eyes water though
B	used to
B	do it with er leaves as well didn't we?
C	with what?
B	erm

A	oh lemon balm yeah you can do that as well
C	erm
B	something
C	what what is very good for colds
A	yeah
C	purple sage so that would give off a good scent
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and maybe it was something like erm
A	maybe it was like that yeah
C	spearmint?
B	yeah
A	yes
B	mm
C	er
B	I suppose anything that is sort of
C	sage would sage is good
B	clears
A	yeah
B	mm

C	didn't they?
B	mm
A	well they had to didn't they? I mean they
C	well they had to find out things like that themselves didn't they? they just got dumped off

C	mm
A	and inevitably fall in
B	it wasn't very deep though was it?
A	deep enough to
B	well obviously yeah
A	I mean er you can drown in a couple of inches of water
B	mm
C	but you've gotta learn you don't go into rivers and things like that
A	well of course you do yeah
B	yeah

B	oh
C	if you do
A	yeah

A	yeah
C	from the kitchen room you went through a quite a quiet
A	area
C	room
A	yeah
C	then up
B	mm
C	the stairs it was a loo at the bottom of the stairs you went
B	yeah
C	up the stairs and there was a four-man room round one side
B	that's right
A	yeah
A	we were right we're right at the top
C	were you right up in the top?
A	yeah
B	mm
C	yeah then you must've been gone up the other side

B	yeah
C	and one of the other guys asked something and was saying I've come across I think he had something to do with looking after kids
A	yeah
C	you know or social services for kids or something
B	yeah
C	but she won't be able to deal with other people
A	well it is that is a problem
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	then if they meet lots of people on the way
C	well yes but it's still one to one
B	yeah
C	with her mum
A	yeah
B	it is
C	it's not you're not learning in a group
B	no

B	oh
C	and er but but
A	who did we have we we knew that just taught their kids?
B	yeah we knew quite a few didn't we and I can't remember who they are
A	yeah
C	cos there's
B	yeah
C	there's a lady in the village who's doing it

B	yeah
A	that was there when we were up
C	mm
