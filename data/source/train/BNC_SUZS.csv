A	yeah I know
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
B	I bet they couldn't like can't
[ANNOTATION]	person B is sure that ,they couldn't like	Neutral
A	just cos they're so fat

B	I bet they'd be scared of a toy mouse like it squeaks and they're like oh
A	oh no can you imagine like a hunter gatherer society sort of they have just Pugs what would it do?
B	this is our hunter Pug
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	ah so cute
A	it's just so it's literally just alive to be cute
B	we've literally bred everything that's like natural or like
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about football	Contradiction
B	and just left the shell of squishy fat
A	just degenerating every day oh no oh no
B	just cos we bred them cos they're cute
A	yeah I know how do how do we evolve it to get it to be like that?
B	I don't know
A	that's so immense
B	I thought I think they're from like China
A	oh really?
B	I'm not sure
A	is that just cos it looks Chinese or something?
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure is it Chinese or not	Neutral
B	no because I think they're from China
A	oh okay Chihuahuas are they it's something to do with Mexico and it's something to do with Japan I don't know they're either from Japan and they're named after a place in Mexico or
B	but Chihuahua is a region in Mexico
A	okay yeah yeah so I think they're Japanese dogs but they're named after somewhere in Mexico maybe they exported them to Mexico and they got the name there something like that
B	or maybe maybe they got into the wild and I can't imagine them living in the wild
A	can you imagine a pack of er Chihuahuas what would they hunt?
B	well there was that movie about Chihuahuas?
A	was there?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	Beverly Hills Chihuahua?
B	no no maybe
A	it's just like one one rich woman carrying around her Chihuahua? oh
B	no I don't know erm well it's a Chihuahua and he got and he got separated from his owner and they
A	oh was it Dogs or something?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person B sure that , it is dog	Entailment
A	was it was it no I mean was it was it the name the film named Dogs?
B	no no
A	cos there's a film called Cats and they had Dogs Versus Cats
B	yeah I know Cat Dogs
A	Cats Versus Dogs yeah
B	that was a good movie
A	yeah yeah the cats were funny
B	but why were the cats evil?
A	they're
B	why are cats always painted as like horrible?
A	I think it's just cos like every now and then you get that nasty cat every now and then but so everyone just assumes that all
B	but loads of dogs are terrifying
A	yeah yeah I think way more terrifying
B	and they they naturally just like kills things
A	exactly
B	the only reason they're cute is cos we've bred them to be that way
A	exactly they're not ah no
B	ah no
A	ah no
B	a Pug would a Pug would never harm you though not on purpose
A	it'd just run into you accidentally have you er have you did you ever? er Jenna Marbles and her boyfriend Julien well they they have a Youtube
B	Jenna Marbles?
A	they have a Youtube channel and they're she originally had two dogs you know Marbles the Chihuahua and then this Italian Greyhound and they're actually the cutest things ever and like do do you know Prank versus Prank? they have these two cats erm and that's what really got me into wanting a cat cos they're the two cutest cats ever
B	oh right
A	they're what are they Savannah cats? so like one's er they're like slightly dog-like because they er I don't know apparently they do more than the average cat and then and then
B	yeah
A	so I need cats and dogs I'm gonna get a Pug and two cats that's my plan so so yeah
B	and then the like it'll be like an entourage with the Pugs in front and two cats on the side
A	yeah yeah but it's not
B	would you get the same type of cat?
A	erm I don't know I'd get one cat first and if it if it's cool then I keep it otherwise not keep it I mean I'd get another one if it's like really lame then I'd get a different different breed of cat I guess
B	his cat seems nice
A	it's
B	it's all fluffy
A	so
B	you've got an either or situation
A	yeah
B	you're gonna
A	yeah
B	which is you just open it and there's just a stream of animals just comes out
A	a stream of Pugs oh oh no oh oh okay you know there's like a legal limit? yeah yeah yeah
B	what?
A	in California there's a legal limit on the number of cats you can have yeah yeah so you know
B	yeah yeah yeah right yeah
B	what the fuck?
A	in the
B	why do you need that many?
A	I don't know they're so cute she's cos she's literally a crazy cat lady she's amazing
B	why do you need that many cats though? I remember she was an
A	yeah yeah she was either in
B	yeah
A	me and
B	I was like whoa I didn't know you were in
A	it was sick it was sick yeah
B	it looks like that guy's got really fluffy skin
A	where?
B	he's wearing can you see his shorts are the same colour as his body?
A	oh I see yeah yeah oh god oh no look at it oh it's like flabby like like uh god yeah she has five cats now
B	I would
A	yeah you can yeah you can er as long as they don't take over the place as long as that I'm in charge and they know I'm in charge then it's I can have as many if they become their own little herd yeah it's the same with dogs if you have a certain number of dogs and they become like a pack
B	you're not gonna have like a Youtube?
A	no but they just start disobeying you cos one of them becomes the leader instead of you
B	oh
A	something like that I don't know
B	can you imagine having a Pug
A	they would just like sneeze like like how could it say no? it's like it just it just stands there have you ever seen when Chihuahuas like they they they they tilt their head like what? like when you say something like do you wanna go?
B	Chihuahuas are scary
A	yeah some are really scary some are cute though but when they bark you're like what the what the fuck are you gonna do like? you're gonna
B	they're just like so small and they're constantly vibrating cos then I I don't have I can't survive
A	oh
B	I was not bred for this
A	oh yeah but they were born for it
B	I mean they were born cos we engineered them
A	yeah exactly
B	to be tiny tiny
B	they're so cute
A	so would you get I mean like like are you not allowed to have them would you not be allowed to have a dog
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	well my parents don't like any pets at all
A	oh okay ah yeah even a gerbil
B	no
A	oh no
B	nothing
A	I'll buy you a gerbil
B	oh I'm gonna have to gonna throw it away though
A	yeah throw it away? you can't just
B	no donate it
A	no you can't just throw a gerbil away
B	I'm not gonna throw it in the bin
A	where are you gonna put it? if it's outside it's it's gonna die
B	no er I'll donate it to I don't know the RSPCA
A	yeah we caught a mouse once
B	yeah
A	and they're like way
A	they're like
B	yeah
A	and erm we were thinking of just putting it in the cage and watch the gerbil rip it shreds I mean we think the gerbils would have ripped it to shreds
B	that's terrifying
A	the mouse could rip it them to shreds but the mouse was so like malnourished and skinny
B	what kind of Hunger Games shit are you running?
A	I don't know it would just be cool right? I mean it's evil but it would be cool anyway I've got to go now I'll I'll talk to you later
B	goodbye
A	goodbye
