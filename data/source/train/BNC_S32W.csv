A	High-tech bit of equipment
B	it's very
A	mm
B	it gives really good sound quality as well
A	well yeah I'm still trying to
B	yeah? What what sport?
A	football and tennis were the er
B	uh-huh
A	two big ones
B	uh-huh
A	and then picked up football about at the age of about ten
B	mm mhm
A	well what could I do?
A	I could do journalism instead
B	getting free tickets
A	getting free tickets
A	and that was like the real selling point for me
B	mhm
A	did three years on a um honours degree and
B	is that a
A	it was
B	yeah
A	quite a lot of journalism courses across the country
B	mhm
A	only a handful did did specifically sports journalism so
B	uh-huh
A	um
B	mhm
A	didn't really hone your skills as a writer
B	really?
A	only a couple of modules were really kind of
B	really?
A	but obviously
B	it is
A	yeah
B	to get into the second year
A	that's yeah likewise
B	yeah
A	and just essentially not turn up for it
B	mm
A	it was like twelve hours a week
B	mhm
A	so I set about trying to obviously get a first
B	mm
A	unfortunately for me on the two er years that they had like had a six-week work placement I had mumps the first year
B	oh no
A	so I missed out on that
B	oh
A	and then the second year I got a really good one for cos I'm I am a a
B	uh-huh
A	so I'm a half-Scouser
A	and um yeah I tried to get a job
B	huh
A	it was really late notice
B	oh no
A	they said oh we can't
B	was that for er
A	yeah
B	tut
A	so when it came to me graduating I was really panicking at that point thinking oh I've got no experience whereas everyone else has got
B	yeah
A	good good solid foundation
B	mhm
A	I need to maybe have another extra qualification to make me stand out
B	mhm
A	we hadn't learnt shorthand
B	mm
A	done
B	mhm
A	but um yeah from that
B	did you do a postgrad as well?
A	the postgrads the it was a print journalism based one
B	ah
A	which is what I really wanted to get into
B	uh-huh
A	but I got um a work experience placement um at a website called TEAMtalk
B	mhm
A	um
B	tut
A	so I was
B	what what were they looking for then?
A	they well they were just some some kind of experience in a  in a  press room doing print journalism
B	right
A	so I couldn't I tried to er er like er here
B	yeah
A	anywhere
B	it's so difficult isn't it
A	and it er you have to know someone in there who who kind of just goes oh put this guy in
B	yeah
A	and that's what happened to me when I was at TEAMtalk
B	brilliant
A	put you forward
B	mm
A	so I had another two weeks at Sky
B	mhm
A	and then they offered me a contract there like as a like a rolling year contract
B	yeah
A	working on the bar but but the that gave me a little bit more
B	yeah
A	some of the stuff I got to do I I in
B	mhm
A	that'd be one of my main sports
B	okay
A	so while I was there so
B	cool
A	then commentary as well
B	mhm
A	like that
B	cool
A	um
B	the up updates
A	yeah
B	that's how I watch the Formula One now it's been sold to Sky
A	yeah so
B	I am
A	yeah
B	tut
A	er er a bit more than it was shall we say
B	mm
A	but
B	well they've pretty much doubled the amount of races since
A	since they've took it on
B	since yeah
A	the all the qualifying now and everything
B	mm
A	um
B	mhm
A	but yeah so you know the two and a half years up there
B	and you didn't fancy staying up there?
A	well er the the only downside was was the pay
B	mm
A	journalist company without their permission
B	right
A	um
B	you're joking?
A	it was er just rolling or and and the
B	tut
A	worst bit of it there was no set hours
B	yeah
A	you were contracted to
B	yeah
A	and when I  when I  first was up there I used my savings to to um finance me being up there
B	mm
A	and and what-not
B	mm
A	journalist to being where I was when I  when I  finished working there
B	crazy
A	er
B	and also six pounds an hour and not giving you a set number of shifts so you know how much money you're gonna earn
A	no
B	the next month and
A	what was that like?
B	depends on how many students they have as to whether you get work the next month
A	yeah
B	and well er basically that's why I moved back to England
A	yeah
B	never knowing when I'd have holiday
A	mm
B	probably wouldn't have get to have a holiday cos I'd have to be working
A	yeah
B	you know just getting random classes here and there just to
A	yeah
B	make ends meet
A	from a
B	mm
A	the creative aspect
B	mhm
A	and you'd build like rapport and like using like things like Twitter
A	um
B	mm
A	be a bit more astute
B	uh-huh
A	and I worked at
B	ah
A	so I kind of worked here when I was studying and
B	uh-huh
A	came back every now and then
B	mm
A	and really social
B	mhm
A	it was very robotic would the word I'd use
B	really?
A	they would um you'd get
B	mhm
A	it was my first experience of that
B	mm
A	respected
B	what's hot-desking? I've heard this expression before
A	hot-desking is where you er it would be the you come in
B	mhm
A	his deputy and then the er and er it was split into two sections
B	uh-huh
A	but then um you'd want like obviously they'd rotate who'd be on shift
B	mhm
A	maybe five depending on how much sport time on that desk
B	oh okay
A	and you kind of hot-desking is when you can go round on other people's
B	tut
A	so there was a lot of cliquey stuff like that
B	what a shame
A	a football desk was even worse to a degree
B	mhm
A	um
A	and a bit more personality
B	mhm
A	and that sometimes counted against me
B	mhm
A	um
B	and be robots
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and then that's it
B	yeah
A	real life as well
A	as when er his writing was
B	uh-huh
A	I'm
B	he had a sabbatical
A	sabbatical
B	mm
A	and he er
B	sounds like he's
A	yeah
A	and I think he went to Peru for I think four or five months
B	mhm
A	so I had regular hours
B	mm
A	but I was working quite a lot of hours
B	tut
A	and that was it
B	what a caring environment
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but but we need to make an example out of you
B	tut
A	so I was just like
B	tut
A	that that was er quite I was like well do you realize I said like I've been here two and a half years and
B	mm
A	you you've never once brought up me
B	mhm
A	um
B	mhm
A	if they're gonna give you two days off it might not necessarily be like which is what they should do
B	yep
A	it might roll over into a different week
B	mm
A	so when with the way Sky did it it meant that er I was doing one day where I was did fifteen days one  period where I did fifteen days
B	oh no
A	then I got in at half nine
B	yeah
A	quite a  quite a  severe one
B	mhm
A	um
B	oh no
A	like and I  and I  kinda took took the risk
B	mhm
A	um
B	mhm
A	however
B	oh
A	and it got delayed by an hour and a half
B	oh no
A	and I er come in to work
B	uh
A	wasn't like er the similar situation where I um tut he was relying on me being in
B	uh-huh
A	however
B	tut
A	and he didn't even tell them what happened
B	yeah
A	the situation
B	mm
A	like just without thinking about it
B	yeah
A	like having a disposable income
B	yeah
A	to get by
B	scrape it together
A	scrape yeah
A	delay rent and
B	spending your savings
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and so it er it
B	mm
A	yeah
B	someone who they employed on a six pound an hour basis
A	yeah
B	and not let them pursue other avenues of
A	yeah
B	employment while working for you that's working for them
A	well that that's BSkyB and the er that company I I believe
B	that's Rupert Murdoch
A	yes
B	isn't it
A	no
A	if I could I'd change
A	but yeah
B	uh-huh
A	so I'd um and it in that sense it it the time was quite well because I could quickly make a decision to come back here
B	mhm
A	and I thought um it would be so much er huh so much of a better idea to come back home
B	mm
A	I did make good friends up in Leeds but it I always used to come back here once a month anyway
A	so I was never felt like I'd I'd lost my ties here as well
B	mm
A	um I grew up I I'm from originally Chelmsley Wood
B	mhm
A	um
A	er I lived in Yardley as well so
B	oh right
A	I've and I've I've that's where I'm back at now
B	aw
A	that's good
A	which is nice
B	I hope you cook your mum dinner too
A	I did
B	aw
A	so
B	er what did you cook her?
A	er we had a Sunday roast
A	did chicken for her and and chicken and beef actually
B	lovely
A	Yorkshire puddings
B	oh so now are you  are you  trying to get back into the
A	yeah
B	journalism side?
A	well when I as soon as I er came back I I got in touch with all the newspapers
B	yeah
A	that worked well for me last time
B	mhm
A	I had no no feedback again
B	yeah
A	um
B	it's soul-destroying isn't it?
A	mm
B	sending out all your CV and you know
A	er
B	investing a lot of time and effort into it
A	but yeah I've looked at other things and other forms of writing like marketing which is another thing I looked at
B	mm
A	um
B	mhm
A	I applied for
B	mhm
A	of applying to graduate scheme after graduate scheme
B	yeah
A	you it's you apply for a hundred and hope you get one
B	yeah
A	the one yes and a hundred and ninety-nine nos is still a yes so
B	that's a good way of looking at it
A	well yeah
B	I'll remember that
A	yeah
B	my er my CV again
B	this weekend
A	but yeah
B	mm
A	try and be ultra-positive and
B	yeah
A	you know
B	mhm
A	a part of me thought no I'd like a new challenge
B	mhm
A	and and get in cos I I'd worked here for so long and I I
B	oh
A	than
B	have you thought about manage getting into management here?
A	I did
B	right
A	um
A	even in my supervisor role that um it's just not my I'm not that kind of person
B	mm
A	anyway
B	you wouldn't have sacked someone for being late twice
A	no
A	definitely not
A	er but um
B	mm
A	yeah it so it like er after after thinking and er again with the competitive side of we wanna try and make this this department the best in the country
B	mm
A	and
B	cool
A	um
B	excellent
A	blogger Ball
A	er so Blogger Ball
A	is the er my URL and and stuff
B	what are you writing about?
A	well it is gonna be predominantly sport
B	mhm
A	Anfield last weekend
B	mhm
A	um
B	oh dear
A	but um yeah
B	who do you support?
A	I'm a Liverpool fan
B	oh
A	yeah
A	bottom of the league and never beat us at Anfield ever in the history
B	oh
A	yeah
B	mhm
A	and I still don't really completely agree with a lot of the ethics in it
B	mhm
A	broadened my horizon so
B	what about things like cricket? Are you a fan? Yeah?
A	big fan of cricket
B	really? Ah
A	yeah
B	Cos my a couple of my friends work for the BBC
A	okay
B	and um one er my best friend's brother worked at he got into the Asian Network um as a broadcast journalist
A	oh okay
B	and then he went freelance
A	oh
B	yeah
A	premier football
B	yeah
A	yeah
A	Good stuff
B	that's the one
B	you know
A	or yeah yeah
B	advice
A	yeah I I well um I've I've never been one to to look a gift horse in the mouth
B	mm
A	to network and to meet people
B	mhm
A	and I've had a lot of people give me some stuff for marketing
B	mm
A	but just just to be creative I think for me
B	yeah yeah
A	market for too many Brummies there that's the only thing
B	dulcet tones of the Brummie accent
B	well no presenting would be cool surely?
A	well one of the guys I used to work with as well and
B	mm
A	talk to them and we'd have like the the coffee  and stuff like that
B	oh right
A	so I was just like fantastic for him
B	that's great
A	um
A	er but er they'd have to pay me well put it that way
B	how about contacting him and see if he's made any contacts that you could use?
A	that's an idea
B	it's always
A	yeah
B	you know it's always um I
A	yeah
B	and the contacts that they know than
A	yeah
B	mm
A	being being creative
B	mhm
A	um
B	yes
A	yeah
B	home
A	how's it for you then? How are you finding it?
B	yeah
A	well er with the weather like this
B	I know
A	I suppose it's not too bad
B	the
A	should I be out?
B	oh I should get home
A	shall I try this but yeah
B	write my CVs
A	mm
B	I should be doing this
A	yeah
B	but
A	the time that comes when I've I'm I don't have to think about that
B	no
A	recently
B	me either
A	so um did you say you lived in Barcelona?
B	yeah
A	Cos my my girlfriend she's
B	uh-huh
A	for my opinion I think she's really good um like
B	mhm
A	we're talking about going to Barcelona for like a little get-away and
B	brilliant
A	I've never been  I've I've never been  to mainland Spain so I'd love to
B	mm
A	to check that out
B	do it
A	have you been anywhere else in Spain?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Alicante
A	yeah
B	but Barcelona's definitely a fantastic place to visit
A	oh huh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	uh-huh
A	do you know anywhere here around like locally or?
B	mm
A	brasshouse?
B	yeah
A	okay
B	and um at the
A	mm
B	is that  is that  north-east?
A	it's
B	it is isn't it
A	um
B	kind of out past
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	or do know?
B	yep
A	near there
B	yeah
A	um
B	Edgbaston's probably a bit too far for her isn't it
A	or maybe somewhere if there's like the
B	yeah
A	like well she she wanted ideally something that we could both go to
A	like um s or er I dunno that's about it to
A	but um yeah she's obviously a lot she did it for seven years
B	mm
A	Cos I just thought er wouldn't it be a bit
B	conversation
A	yeah
B	class
A	mm
B	has she spoken it at all over the past seven years?
A	well yeah like and she's er up until a couple of years ago she was doing it like for her A-levels
B	oh okay
A	so yeah yeah
B	she did it for seven years
A	yeah yeah
B	I thought you said she hadn't hadn't done it for
A	no no
B	seven
A	yeah yeah so er er been doing it for seven years
B	okay
A	novice
A	amateur
B	goal
A	yeah
B	I can say goal
A	I was gonna say any words I probably know is from football-based things so
A	yeah
A	mm
B	while she was doing her main lessons
A	mm
B	mm
A	that'd be good
B	you er seem to be you seem to possess all the characteristics of a good language learner
A	mm
B	you know
A	well maybe that's true
B	um
A	mm
B	be there when she was having a class
A	no
B	I've got a friend who works at
A	oh right
B	um yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	yeah well I'll cos I've
B	I can ask her or
A	we said at the start yeah this is something we can do
B	mhm
A	whereas if she wants to be able to keep it and really use it
B	mm
A	it was great
A	like to be a laugh
A	but but it was like
A	and all this
B	that is good
A	yeah
A	so we'd all like all have really get like get into it that way
B	mhm
A	work in when I was like sixteen seventeen got to know a couple of members
B	mhm
A	one to teach French
A	like a three-way conversation with all in different languages
A	and that was one of the first things when I met er
A	but um
B	what does she do?
A	she's at the moment she's studying fashion and retail management
B	oh
A	at
B	ah
A	er the the one at the
B	uh-huh
A	the er College of Art I think it is
B	ah
A	I think it is
B	ah
A	ah
B	yeah
A	excellent
B	is she doing er an undergrad
A	yeah
B	degree?
A	undergrad degree at the moment
B	ah okay
A	yeah
B	she's probably on the course with a lot of the Chinese students that I teach in the summer
A	oh okay
B	make sure their English is brushed up for them to start in September
A	are you er do you speak any Chinese or
B	no
A	I was gonna say
A	I was thinking then you you
B	nothing
A	I er what language you
B	spanish
A	oh so from Barcelona
B	yeah
A	see I think that's just cos I think for a lot of English people it's like we don't I think the perception is that we don't think that we need to learn another language really
B	mm
A	which is a shame
B	it is
A	but
B	people are very imperialistic about speaking languages
B	I don't know
B	and my dad's favourite is scusi scusi
B	I don't know what language he thinks it comes from but
B	he just kind of
A	it's a generic one just to get attention
B	er oh no
A	yeah
A	oh no
B	fashion and retail management? mm
A	I think it's I er I think it's just one course
B	uh-huh
A	um
B	mhm
A	next season
B	yeah
A	so it's really
B	mm
A	kind of prepping them for that
B	yeah
A	mm
B	training
A	yeah
B	I've got a friend there at the moment
A	okay
B	yeah
A	Cos they all sound like er  like er  they could be so
B	mm
A	open-ended couldn't they
B	mhm
A	whereas like not for me like when people said er you can do a degree in sports journalism?
A	like but they do they can be so specific as well
B	uh-huh
A	in there's a  there's a
B	mm
A	loves loves the beauty side of things
B	mhm
A	go down to London and and and like either do like cos she she's someone as well who's quite um
B	mm
A	tut media savvy er and and can write as well

A	er the the we talked about that
A	we'll have like in one half have yours
A	and then the second half and and
B	how to be beautiful on the tennis courts

B	there you go
A	yeah
B	for
A	that's right
B	the design of her sports was it I can't
A	yeah
B	for the Olympics?
A	it's er all the for the Olympics
B	the uniform
A	you've got mixed reviews
B	yeah
B	I just can't believe how skimpy the female
A	yeah like and
B	uniforms are getting
A	er and
B	mm
A	it's not you er you gotta have the colours that we that that makes up the er the the flag
B	yes
A	yeah
B	her uniforms
A	mm
B	what do you call the
A	um on the
B	gear
A	yeah
A	apparel or  apparel or
B	uh-huh
A	I dunno
A	well er
A	no as I say you are getting into journalistic terms there
A	that's what
A	we'd try and er dramatic
B	yeah
A	huh
B	choose your words carefully
A	yeah
B	and where did you meet?
A	um
B	it wasn't David Lloyd was it?
B	uh-huh
A	um
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	but I've got a friend who
A	yeah
B	lives opposite
A	where it is
B	and er it opens at two P two A M
A	yeah
B	or something
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	runs the VIP section
B	mhm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking about the VIP section that is is a good choice	Entailment
A	traditionally the gym staff er go out and they drink quite early and they can't handle their drink
A	um
A	and um only one guy who was a member here er he he was the
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that he might not a member	Neutral
B	last guy standing
A	yeah with me
B	you have to pay to get in as well?
A	A tenner
B	is it er so what is it?
A	so it's like er
B	it's just a bar?
A	it's not a bar it's er it it is big enough
B	mhm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is thinking that it is a bar and it is not that much big	Neutral
A	that's like it's big enough to have well they've got a dance floor and they've got an outdoor area
B	mhm
A	but yeah so I'm with this guy and the
A	and we were sitting down and he it he being er he wasn't obviously afraid to to go and say hello to er
A	mm yes um
B	mm
A	so I kind of made that presumption
A	and then he go over there chatting to them and he calls me over
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is feeling so bad about the things that Person C said	Contradiction
B	mm
A	and just introduced myself
A	bit of an awkward conversation
B	painful
A	yeah
A	having a right laugh and and just messing around so
A	stuff like that as a joke
B	ah
A	yeah I think that was a definite um
B	pull
B	sorry not that I'm saying that you pulled her but yeah
A	no
B	pull factor to get you back to
A	yes
A	yeah
B	cool
A	I have had one more night back there and
A	to er to reminisce
A	so I wasn't as on as er last man standing shall we say
A	probably first first faller
B	you joined the gym
A	yeah I've er perhaps
B	the gym staff
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	the sports centre like you er do they have different stereotypes? So the people who work in the gym can't drink and the
A	that's yeah that's a a
B	mm
A	if I'm staying here
A	um
B	is that food and beverage?
A	yeah
A	mm
A	as well as reception
B	uh-huh
A	um
B	and are the management here are they quite um
A	sociable?
B	er
A	were you gonna say or?
B	accessible and
A	yeah
B	communicative?
A	I'd say
B	oh
A	but in some ways very very poor
B	mm
A	cos I've had an experience of working at other David Lloyd's
B	mhm
A	there's um tut I
B	mm
A	done here
B	mhm
A	it's an annual event we have
B	hm
A	but then they do turn up as well
A	so it's kind of I think people like to just have their say cos they can if you will
B	mhm
A	um but then er it's not really helped that I don't think the management here are that proactive either so
B	mhm
A	doing a managementrole
B	yeah
A	Cos I just don't think er I'm joining in good company
B	mhm
A	atmosphere
B	mhm
A	better about my job so
B	tut aw
A	which is a shame
A	I was gonna say yeah
A	sometimes
A	um your mum's very
B	Fizzy
A	no no no no no
A	I probably won't eat all of I'll just get a kid's menu menu one and
A	a few times before I realized it was for your mum
B	oh
A	here go you
A	so
B	well she is little enough to
A	yeah
B	she was a sports teacher
A	like the kid's sizes
B	kiddies' departments
A	really?
B	yeah
A	that's brilliant
B	you don't have to pay VAT on them either
A	oh excellent
B	then again I can't talk
A	mm
B	I only surpass her by one inch I think
A	excellent
A	today? Well I'm done now
B	oh dear
A	I'm doing six days straight
B	three o'clock till two in the morning? Woo
A	and I'm I'm manager that day
A	um
B	oof

A	er well I wish I did
B	sun-chairs
A	yeah
A	last
B	mm
A	um
B	mhm
A	do you know where er near the Greville Pub?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I know that area
A	yeah

A	so it's not too far
B	that's where I'm learning to drive at the moment
A	oh are you learning to drive?
B	yeah
A	you see I'm I don't cos I don't drive yet at the moment
B	uh-huh
A	I've
B	mhm
A	so that's one thing that I'm
B	cool
A	really?
B	he's super
A	okay
B	I'm sure you'd
A	I'm definitely er going for that
B	really?
A	yeah
B	oh brilliant then
A	oh wonderful
B	just opposite um where the old gasworks used to be
A	yeah
B	you know the mill pool?
A	yeah
B	I think he lives down there
A	oh
B	and his two daughters play football
A	oh wonderful
B	he's a really nice guy
A	and how many lessons have you had so far then?
B	I've had five
A	have  have you have  you drove never before?
B	never
A	no?
B	apart from one
A	wow
B	time when I um a friend of my brother's was said oh do you want do you wanna have a go then? And so I had a go and I reversed his car into a tree
B	it warped the body of the car so he couldn't open the
A	oh no
B	so yeah no I've never really learnt to drive
A	yeah
B	travelling and
B	mm
A	been any other defining factor or?
B	no not
A	have you never really needed to?
B	well no
A	mm
B	Cos you you have to pay for it to er pay for a parking tut space for it
A	mm
B	and
A	I can imagine
B	a good price
A	A wheel
B	a wheel
A	I think that's a good idea in some ways
B	yeah
A	oh okay
B	just because I couldn't er
A	yeah
B	well no it's just the motivation really
A	mm
B	if you've got the motivation of knowing that oh I'm actually gonna be learning the skill of driving
A	mm
B	it's not as motivating
A	okay
B	really
A	I suppose not
B	but
A	so why why have you why are you learning to drive now then? Is it just because you're moving back here or
B	well it's basically cos I think it's a skill that if I don't use it I'll lose it
A	yeah
B	not but if I don't learn now I think it will be more difficult to learn in the future
A	mm
B	really?
B	mm
A	he's he's like I say he he'd lost the er appetite to learn stuff
B	mm
A	and I think he just found it a lot more challenging than he would've if he was younger
B	yeah
A	it's been fine
B	yeah
A	like I don't mind cycling but for me living in Yardley and trying to get to Danielle's
B	yeah
A	an hour and a half of going back home then going out to Sutton
B	yeah
A	but
B	most of er all isn't it
A	yeah
B	definitely
A	yeah
B	er
B	I've got his er mobile number here
A	I'll see if I've got still got battery
B	let's see

B	I thought oo gosh shall I  shall I  send him a text back? He hasn't got much battery
A	no
B	let's see
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	oh have you?
[ANNOTATION]	person A asked have you	Entailment

[ANNOTATION]	person A can do turn left	Neutral
A	that's  start
B	oh er

B	uh-huh
A	so I was gonna have ten lessons
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
B	mhm
A	I still think having those ten lessons over a longer period of time
B	yeah
A	is better
B	would somebody that you know be up for taking you out to practice while you're having lessons?
A	er a few of the guys here have as well
B	Cos er I reckon if
A	mm
B	if you've got the aptitude for it and
A	see that  that if  if I could do that then that'd be great
B	yeah
A	rather than do the intensive as well
B	maybe you wouldn't even need to do an intensive
A	mm
B	I wanna take more lessons
A	Cos I think one thing I've got which would suit me cos I've cycled now for about five years
