B	Nicole Kidman's daughter
C	yeah
B	but it's a different it's a different mentality isn't it?
D	mm
C	yeah
B	it's like in New Zealand
C	yeah
B	when you see the All Blacks going through whatever regional airport
D	mm
A	nobody even touches them
C	no
D	no
A	just leave them to kind of be who they are and
B	nobody

C	mm
B	like just over there
A	they had two erm
D	yeah

C	yeah I yes
B	and they were all having a play in the playground this playground's quite big
C	yeah
C	actor yeah
B	he had a bit of a crowd
C	mind it no
B	and people asked him for autographs
C	yeah
B	but he didn't
C	well that's who's made them famous so
B	yeah
C	I don't think they should mind really cos the public have made them famous haven't they?
B	no they shouldn't
C	yes they do yeah
B	cos they've
C	mm
B	got a really heightened sense of importance of self importance
C	yes I think they do get a bit above themselves don't they?
B	yeah
D	oh yeah yeah
B	and they're not they're not amazing for anything in particular
D	no
B	apart from being in the papers
D	the papers
C	mm
D	yeah
D	famous for being famous
B	or some dodgy TV show that
D	yeah
B	shows that they have no talent really
D	yeah
B	whatsoever
D	yeah
B	it's bizarre isn't it?
D	what like
C	mm
D	erm Only Way
B	Only
C	yeah The Only Way
B	you see I I
C	Chelsea
D	Made In Chelsea
C	Made In Chelsea
B	oh is that right I what's the Made In Chelsea one about?
C	oh that's it's fascinating I love it I love all I love the Essex one and l love Chelsea but it's all
D	it's all
C	oh yeah I don't know where they well
B	what's the format of it?
C	well it's erm
unknown_female	mm
C	it's a group of twenty year old plus
B	right
C	and they just go shooting and they have parties I think they
B	why shooting?
C	yeah but they they're not they're very posh and they go clay pigeon shooting
B	oh they go oh
C	they go polo they go to polo
B	right
C	but they don't seem to work I don't know what they do very bizarre things
B	oh that's strange isn't it?
C	yes yeah and it's all about their lives and they're always falling out drinking
A	mm
D	educated
A	there's one that I
D	yeah
A	seven to ten year olds
D	yeah
A	or something like that
D	yeah
A	trying to place their kids into Harrow
D	yeah yeah
D	yeah
A	and that was really really interesting
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	do you think it's real?
C	it is some of it is real but some of it is set up for your own
B	right
C	they are real people
B	yeah
C	they do
B	yeah
C	live their lives unbelievably like that
B	wow
C	they're quite
B	cos you you do wonder if you they find these actors
D	mm
A	they're not
C	no they weren't they're a group of friends
B	they're they are real people
C	yeah and erm in the summer they were over in erm New York
B	you see I'm asking a question there
C	shopping in Prada
B	and I think to myself would they have gone to New York had they not been in a TV programme?
C	well
B	or the TV programme pays for them to go to New York
C	oh I don't know that
B	as in to get like a bit more of entertainment out of it
C	possibly possibly
A	mm
C	but it sounded like they go over there as a thing to do
B	yeah
C	and you
B	I think it's right like you know I
C	yeah
C	yeah
B	all sorts of things
C	yeah yeah
B	but they have been heavily screened
C	yeah
B	to be a particular type
C	type yes
C	cos they're all attractive
B	and
C	yeah
B	if somebody says oh you might suggest
C	yeah
B	going to New York
C	yeah
B	and doing this with these people
C	yeah
B	you go if you're twenty
C	yes yeah
B	I would
C	yeah
B	and especially so if you give me some pocket money
C	yes yeah
C	but they've all been school
B	yeah
C	they've all been to
C	their own boarding schools and things
B	yes
C	cos they talk about meeting but Chelsea
C	but I don't know what they do day to day
B	right
C	one of them's in dabbles in a bit of photography
B	right
C	erm like The Only Way Is Essex they have opened shops in Brentwood
B	right
C	so they've all got beauty salons dress shops
B	so there's some sort of something
C	yeah
B	just their lives as in they set up a business and
C	but
B	ah
C	I
B	ah
C	cos Brentwood you have holiday companies bringing all the young people who watch it and they stay in the motel
B	right
C	erm and yeah it's makes big business
B	around yeah
C	and Brentwood is a tourist spot now
B	wow
C	which is very amusing
B	yeah
C	so
B	and and what and how
C	yeah
B	you know this TV programme
C	yeah
B	in a way
C	and a lot of them leave the show
B	yeah
C	they they go into that
B	transforms life
C	er yeah
B	and I guess
C	yeah
B	that's the appeal isn't it? that's why people do want to do it
C	I would say he's the only one who's really made it
B	but you see he might've made it without that TV show
C	yeah cos he's got the good looks
B	okay
C	he's got the
B	he would've made it probably
C	nice personality
B	it's just propelled him a bit fast first
C	yeah
B	and none of the others are quite?
C	no they don't really make it
B	really
C	they haven't got quite that edge
B	no
C	to what he had
B	ah they're still in the show
C	well they go
B	get their
C	and everything and then they come back because obviously they can't find themselves so
B	oh I see
C	so they come back to the show
B	right
C	character yeah
B	that just happens to come back in
C	yeah
B	but where's the steady flow of of people
C	well because
B	being fed into it or?
C	yes I think so yeah cos they all meet in the nightclubs they're all kind of
B	oh
C	a room of friends that
B	I see
C	well
B	it makes me think of that
C	oh yes yeah that's
B	Jim
C	that's it
B	and that film was shown years ago
C	that's yeah that's right
B	but it really makes me think that if you are on these shows in these shows
C	well they say for The Only Way Is Essex most of it is true but they set up scenarios that are for your entertainment
B	well yeah
C	so they're either the girls are usually at the beauty salon having their hair or nails done
C	there's er a chap who's gay
B	oh no yeah
C	life and
B	well it is in a way
C	awful really
B	it's well but part of it's compelling because if you think about it it's based on theatre
C	yeah
B	as in all these different characters
C	yes
B	put them all together see what happens
C	yeah
B	then we watch films which we see that happening
C	yeah mm
B	Eastenders whatnot
C	yeah
B	so really this is just moving from that back to reality
C	yeah
B	cos apparently these people are real
C	yes yeah
B	and they are real
C	yeah
B	but they've been erm
C	yes
B	in the sense that
C	yeah
B	there's the fat one
C	yeah
B	there's the this one who doesn't know he's a
C	yeah
B	that's a little artificial
C	yeah
B	for me cos I would say
C	they're all attractive and handsome
B	right
B	attractive handsome
unknown_female	and fake
B	oh for god's sake
C	yeah it isn't until you start digging in it that you think er
B	yeah
C	The Only Way Is Way Is Essex but but you cannot not watch it it's a bit of relaxation and I just find it funny
B	you've got an interest
C	yeah and I know that pub
B	yes yeah yeah
C	oh look at that bit I like
C	but they're awful people their people
B	yeah absolutely
C	their language their and they're horrible
B	they swear a lot?
C	yeah and they cause trouble some have been in prison drugs
B	right
C	one is in drugs he's suddenly out of the show
B	oh dear
C	he's been caught with cocaine
A	yeah so erm
D	yeah yeah
A	erm
D	yeah
A	orchestra
D	yeah yeah yeah
A	that kind of thing
D	yeah
A	like four hours a day of their particular exercises
D	yeah
A	and and I think four out of five of them were heavily pushed by their parents
D	yeah
A	it's er very very very interesting
D	yeah how many of them got in?
A	I think just two
D	yeah
A	having been through the experience
D	yeah
A	and the other two were going to try again
D	right
A	yeah I think he was really experienced and good at all
D	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah cos er they're only erm
D	yeah
A	and if they never you know if they never reach this level
D	yeah
A	then then their whole world comes down crashing down around them
D	yeah
A	then they've gotta kind of rebuild from
D	yeah
A	then you can go up another level
D	yeah
A	but it depends on who
D	if you've already got that background it allows you to move up another level
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah
A	and then in society failure is treated as failure
D	yeah
A	you're at the bottom of the heap you've failed
D	yeah
A	and that's what it is it's an experiment you find you need to change something
A	well there's
D	yeah
A	if you go through school and you've got
D	no
A	but in fact you are the same as everybody else you're just
D	maybe
A	erm I'm very kind of interested in these like kind of alternative ways of education and
D	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah try to challenge having to work within a curriculum
D	yeah yeah OFSTED
A	yeah it's ridiculous
D	it is ridiculous
A	that's it I mean it's it's no different than erm
D	yeah
A	that it no longer
A	yeah
A	yeah sorry?
D	it's where the children in the country live
A	okay
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	Montessori education
D	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
A	but that costs them a lot of money
D	yeah
A	and they I mean they're they're set up as
D	yeah
A	or a franchise or whatever it is
D	you've got Mark Wright who's in Strictly Come Dancing
B	yes
D	he's ex yeah
C	he's made it
B	he's actually done really well hasn't he?
C	he's out of it he never came back did he I think he came back for a Christmas show but he never
D	yeah yeah
B	he's done alright out of it
D	yeah
B	probably
D	possibly
D	yeah
B	faster
D	there's one or two you wouldn't want as
B	yeah
D	next door neighbours
B	but you know getting back to locations and stuff that's what I feel like when I watch Grantchester
