C	so you can work in London? And he can find a job in London can he?
B	yeah
C	what shall we do? What shall we do?
B	yeah
C	it's a difficult one though isn't it?
B	I know
C	exactly
B	yeah
C	I mean I
B	I think if it had been ten years ago we would have both said yeah let's do it
C	how I mean how far out of London can you live so that it's not actually really London living?
B	erm it depends like basically the BBC will give me a relocation package
C	oh yeah
B	so they'd help me sell my house and help finance a move
C	oh right
B	so I could say no I don't want any financial help
C	mm
B	and then I thought well I could commute it from
C	would you miss
B	erm well all my friends are here
C	how far is Hereford from
B	from London?
C	London?
B	be over three hours
C	oh gosh really?
B	between three and four hours I think
C	is it that far?
B	mm
C	oh I guess cos London's more east to the east isn't it
B	mm
C	do you like it?
B	mm
C	it might need a bit of salt and a bit of pepper
B	oh it's really yummy
C	ooh er
B	I can taste carrot
C	yep carrot parsnip potatoes sweet potatoes celery onion
B	mm
C	I think that's it
B	I need to start making soup more
C	but it's so easy
B	oh wow and that's it?
C	yeah
B	God
C	mm
B	Cos I need to start being more healthy
C	really?
B	well me and
C	oh
B	and we were just like right we're not gonna worry about food or anything cos we're both prone to like putting on weight and stuff
C	ah it's holiday though
B	yeah
C	ah well you're still going through that honeymoon period aren't you
B	oh I've never done that
C	no?
B	no
C	so how long was it since you dated and started to realise that you actually?
B	it all happened really fast actually
C	mm
B	I'd say within three weeks we were like we were kind of talked about not moving in straight away but we were kind of like yeah
C	oh wow
B	we can see this going somewhere
C	ah
B	mm
C	and has he met the Boodhoos?
B	mm
C	oh
B	yeah
C	do your parents love him?
B	mm they do
C	ah
B	so yeah I remember at the time everyone was going oh this is going too fast
C	yep
B	there's no point
C	yeah yeah yep
B	saying oh no let's not do this cos you know it's too fast
C	well there's no little rule book is there? It's
B	no
C	as you say how things go naturally and
B	mm
C	important to go with the flow
B	yeah
C	and where's he from?
B	erm he's from the
C	ha
B	yeah so we had a really nice like few days down there when we went to see his parents
C	oh that's a beautiful place
B	erm
C	yep
B	it's like a little village
C	mm mm
B	like you could probably walk to the  to the  actual inter-forest from there
C	is that quite close to
B	it's closer to
C	okay
B	yeah
C	yeah my dad's got a little  a little  boat down near well it's basically just opposite the Isle of White
B	oh okay that's probably close then
C	so he's he sees the
B	mm
C	when my aunt she used to erm her husband was a farmer so she used to breed horses on the farm
B	oh wow
C	and they used to take their horses down to the
B	ah
C	to gallop around on holiday
B	so how are you finding it being back in England?
C	mm
B	do you miss Spain?
C	I miss the weather
B	mm
C	I miss the passion
B	yeah
C	but there's a lot of things that England has that Spain doesn't
B	yeah
C	definitely
B	all the time
C	it is really nice
B	yeah
C	yeah I'm trying to get in a little visit
B	mm
C	just to feel the sun like this for example this morning if it was like this every day
B	how how did you find the winter then that must have been tough
C	well it
B	mm
C	when I got into December I was thinking I can handle this
B	mm
B	are you still speaking Spanish much then? Or have you not spoken any for a while?
C	no actually I've not
B	oh yeah
C	so I was still kind of thinking about it but I mean teaching Spanish at secondary school
B	yeah
C	there's not much teaching or Spanish involved
B	oh God
C	come on sit down
B	oh my God
C	sit down
C	um
B	mm
C	but the thing is once you've engaged the kids that you know are open to it
B	yeah
C	you've got all the ones that are playing up and have got anger management issues or
B	God
C	visual impairment
B	that sounds really tough
C	it is tough because you're dealing with so many variables in the one class
B	mm
C	that er as soon as you've engaged one of the groups you lose all the others
B	yeah
C	so it was only really a handful of naughty boys that used to distract the class
B	yeah
C	but in the schools that I've seen and the schools that you know my colleagues were telling me it's it's not it's now it's only a handful of kids that you can actually work you know teach
B	oh God
C	and it's the rest it's all crowd control and
B	do you think you'll go back to it?
C	mm
B	yeah
C	I mean having done the training in inner city
B	yeah
C	I'm sure that there are schools that that you don't have to handle that amount of misbehaviour and
B	yeah
C	and cos I'm
B	oh okay
C	that's why a lot of the jobs are coming up are in Oxford
B	mm
C	I think if you're targeting publishing it's Oxford Cambridge or London really
B	mm
C	erm
B	okay
C	but that was I think quite normal because I phoned the guy in Human Resources and asked him about this particular job that I couldn't work out whether it was in Oxford or Madrid
C	but I kind of took that opportunity to just quickly tell him my experience and ask him a bit of advice
B	yeah
C	and he was like look you know just because it says we require sales and marketing experience
B	mm
C	if there's one or two things on the requirements list that you don't have send your CV in anyway because
B	okay
C	you never know
B	yeah
C	I didn't  I didn't  think that I think I might have got an interview had they only had like three people
B	yeah
C	ha ha but I don't think in this day and age they only get three people
B	no that's true
C	applying
B	mm
C	yep
B	do you?
C	mm mm
B	oh
C	I did er teach in sixth form too because there were erm most schools nowadays have their own little sixth form
B	yeah
C	and it was generally nicer because they were smaller classes
B	and they wanna be there don't they I guess?
C	they still don't wanna be there
B	oh don't they?
C	no no no no
B	oh
C	they still didn't wanna be there
B	God
C	mm
B	you know it's a kind of a choice isn't it? Cos you don't have to go
C	yeah
B	want to learn
C	yeah
B	mm
C	it's such a shame
B	yeah
C	and of course I'm going into it off fourteen years teaching
B	yeah
C	effectively not because I'm an effective teacher but because the
B	yeah yeah
C	these kids were at least motivated to be there
B	okay
C	because if you're energetic and enthusiastic
B	mm
C	and you know you make them laugh and you get them to do the work
B	yeah
C	and you get them to see that they can actually do it
B	yeah
C	but if you go into a secondary school class of thirty kids who don't want to be there
B	yeah
C	why learning languages would be important
C	and you know make fun of the teacher
B	yeah yeah
C	and then you've just started off completely on the wrong foot with them
B	God
C	well you just have to be really disciplinarian and serious
B	mm
C	gage the class and maybe ease off on the whole seriousness
B	mm
C	oh it's just such a shame
B	hmm
C	it really is
B	yeah
C	no I'd only have to take it up from January
B	oh that's good
C	the stuff I've already done counts
B	yeah
C	but I think it was a bad time for me to do it really cos I I'd just I pretty much had a year of full on intense work
B	yeah yeah
C	without without holidays and went straight from you know full on intense work in Spain to the day that I finished my job I moved back to England
B	oh my God
C	I know so I think maybe with a bit more
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
C	England has changed so much since I left
B	is it? God mm
C	but you'll probably get that if you move to London as well
B	yeah
C	it's like a different country
B	mm
C	yeah
B	and I'm working longer hours
C	mm
B	yeah they would
C	it doesn't reflect the
B	it doesn't cover kind of you know tube fares and
C	yeah
B	and all that
C	mm
B	yeah
C	it is crazy
B	mm
C	and when you're paying the rent and pay like paying bills and stuff it's not significantly
B	yeah
C	cheaper in the areas that they wanna pay people minimum wages
B	yeah yeah I know
C	mm
B	I'm alright thanks actually
C	there's loads left
B	erm the other option is Salford though cos you know loads of Fiat jobs are moving up there
C	ah
B	so I can look into erm redeployment and and see if there's any work in Salford
C	yeah?
B	it's a bit more like
C	what kind of things is he looking for?
B	erm just charity work still
C	what was his PhD in?
B	history
C	what particular part?
B	erm
B	it was something to do with the working class sailors of Southampton in the early nineteen hundreds
C	oh wow
B	that was
C	so in the
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and he got that on the basis of erm he well actually he started off as a an advisor
C	mm
B	and then he's kind of worked himself up from there really
C	oh super
B	yeah
C	yeah I've heard of quite a few people who have erm got their careers out of temp jobs
B	mm
C	well is that something that he he went into quite early though? The temp job early in his career?
B	erm well he's er no only about three years ago
C	okay
B	yeah so he would have been late twenties
C	mm
B	mm I guess so
C	you've got options
B	yeah
C	really? Not even with two salaries?
B	yeah maybe
C	yep
B	like I own a four bedroom house in
C	is that  is that  the one in Bearwood?
B	mm
C	oh okay the one that you rent out?
B	yeah it's me and two other guys
C	uh-huh
B	who yeah rent rooms
C	so are you thinking of moving in together in interim
B	mm
C	oh
B	well I'd like to get married next year if I'm honest
C	really?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	Cos I just think I don't wanna leave it too much later
C	ah
B	which I've told him that so he knows that it has to be soon
C	have you heard heard
B	no
C	yeah
B	oh my God
C	she's getting married at Christmas
B	that's really soon
C	erm I think when they went to India
B	mm
C	they were talking about having kids and and I think he
B	mm
C	erm up
B	okay
C	yeah
B	mm
C	of just party cos it's over Christmas as well
B	yeah
C	just getting his family cos he's French
B	that's right yeah
C	so they have to come from France
B	ah
C	friends
B	I mean er they're not is there not not gong to be like a Sikh wedding or anything?
C	there's going to be erm a registry civil wedding
B	mm
C	for the legal aspects
B	yeah
C	and then they're gonna have a Sikh er ceremony as well so
B	ah
C	for that day he will be
B	wow
C	ah and the dress she showed me was amazing
B	mm
C	so
B	indian style?
C	yeah
B	wow
C	over her shoulders
B	and she's got like the right height and the right figure to carry off stuff like that
C	she's gorgeous isn't she?
B	mm
C	yeah so but I'm not sure if she's wanting to spend that much money on a dress that you'll wear for one day
B	yeah yep one day
B	yeah
C	are you sure you don't want some more soup? There's loads left
B	no I'm alright
C	mm go for it
B	Cos it's really yummy that bread
C	it is
B	is it the same one? Oh is it?
C	well she's marrying
B	oh God yeah
C	the guy who owns that bakery
B	of course
C	the little French café and
B	oh my God
C	so this is his bread
C	funnily enough
B	the last time I saw
C	oh right
B	and it was two days before my date with
B	Cos I was like oh yeah I've got this internet date
C	how things happen
C	and was he did you meet him quite soon after you'd erm signed up to the
B	mm
C	blimey
B	I know it was really bad
C	was he the first date that you had off it as well?
B	yeah first of anyone
C	oh
B	who were potentials as well
B	who you know were really nice and stuff
C	mm mm
B	but erm yeah so he was the first one
C	and did you put your photo up on the site then?
B	mm
C	were you not worried that people in the office would see you or?
B	no cos I think people knew anyway that I was dating and internet dating and stuff
C	oh right
B	so yeah it all happened really quickly
C	and how long had he been on there previously to?
B	he'd probably been on there a couple of months
C	mm
B	I think he had a date with one other girl as well
C	mm mm
B	Cos I think it's the other way round for women
B	whereas girls like to play it cool
C	I don't know
B	mm
C	did he get in touch with you or?
B	mm
C	oh no
B	which I didn't know anyway
B	so I guess I kind of instigated it
C	mm
B	hello
C	hello
A	hello
C	do you know
A	er I don't think we've met have we?
B	I don't think we've we've met? No
C	no? Well Dan's another internet dating success
B	oh okay
C	do you want some soup Dan?
A	er yeah I wouldn't say no
C	help yourself
B	and then there's
C	yeah
B	mm
C	it's not easy living in a situation where you don't know where you're gonna be
B	yeah
C	mm
B	like there's they're not moving anywhere I don't think are they?
C	so what division are you with?
B	well I'm Asian at work but news
C	mm
B	so news side and programme side they're two different
C	mm mm
B	yeah
C	mm
B	so yeah I don't
C	yep
B	I I think she'll be fine on the job
C	but isn't there talk about completely getting rid of the
B	no I don't
C	no?
B	they're getting rid of the Leicester side of things
C	oh okay
B	yeah but
C	can you not work from
B	no
C	mm
B	yeah
C	couldn't you work out some kind of thing whereby you stay in
B	possibly
C	uh-huh
B	so if he does that for me he'll have to do it for everyone and he's not gonna do that
[ANNOTATION]	they are talkin about do something	Neutral
C	oh what a shame
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
C	yep
B	it's a lot harder for them
C	mm
B	but who knows
C	what kind of thing would you be looking for?
B	I don't know
C	oh yeah?
B	erm cos we were like well if I could take the redundancy and do that
C	mm
B	erm we like the idea of opening a restaurant but hope not not as a
C	really?
[ANNOTATION]	they goanna open a restaurant	Entailment
B	like we can't cook
B	we had talked about opening a Mauritian restaurant
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they want opening a Mauritian restaurant	Neutral
B	no one's gonna come to ours
C	is it in
B	well it'll just look like we're jumping on the bandwagon now
C	no
B	maybe
C	people will be up for Mauritian food now
C	what's it like? Mauritian food?
B	mm
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about food	Neutral
B	mm
C	lovely lovely
B	A lot of fish
C	it is nice isn't it? How was your run then?
A	it was good
C	beautiful day for it
A	it's a bit chilly
C	you might have to warm it up
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about chilly food	Entailment
A	I'll give it a blast in the microwave
C	Good idea
B	and so we need to organise some drinks really don't we and have a night out
C	definitely
B	I haven't seen
C	that er German restaurant that you were telling her about sounded good
B	mm
C	oh is it Austrian
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about country's	Entailment
B	mm
C	that sounded really cool
B	it's brilliant
C	have you been there?
B	yeah
B	you go down into the basement and they've turned it into a bar and you're having drinks there
C	and does it look like a does it look like someone's house?
B	from the outside
C	oh
B	and like when you're inside it like it looks like a restaurant but you can kind of tell
C	mm
B	yeah definitely worth going
C	because I've I've heard of these places that erm people actually set up restaurants in their own homes
B	mm
C	but on a very small scale
B	I'm in someone's house
C	yeah
C	but it just sounds a bit a little bit weird
B	yeah once you're in there it does look like a restaurant
C	mm
B	so if they opened a restaurant like that on a residential street
C	what's the food like?
B	yeah really nice
C	but not not that memorable then
B	yeah it's kind of like meat and veg and stuff but you just get a set menu so you have to have three courses
C	mm mm
B	but erm yeah it's definitely I think it's just such a weird experience being in there
C	mm
B	where did Indi take not Indi where did
C	ah to a lovely little restaurant called
B	ah
C	I think they'd er he'd been in London for two days and
B	oh okay
C	she was knackered and and they just got home and said oh where do you wanna go out? And they were like oh shall we just get
B	ah
C	Sabai Sabai to deliver
B	ah
C	and just chilled at home
B	ah
C	which is lovely cos when you're er when you're knackered
B	yeah
C	and you've gotta go to work the next day and you're not really in the  in the  mood for it
B	no
C	mm
B	it must be nice having them so close
C	definitely but she's actually been ill for a bit
B	oh okay
C	she's erm did you know she had to have her wedding ring cut off?
B	no
C	I think erm I don't know whether it was an allergic reaction to the ring
B	mm
C	or whether she had a bit of eczema under it
B	oh yeah
C	he was able to cut it off
B	okay
C	and they were in India and it got better I think under the sun
B	oh okay
C	then when they came back it just flared up again to the extent where it got completely infected
B	oh God
C	got infected
B	she was feeling vomitty
A	has that happened since last weekend?
C	yeah
A	or was this before?
C	no
A	shit
C	I know
B	oh God
C	Cos she's er her little car is on her little drive
B	so they still don't know what caused it then?
C	no they don't know
B	yeah
C	I have no idea
B	mm
C	I don't know
B	yeah
C	but they've given her anti-inflammatories and antibiotics
B	oh okay
C	and steroids and
B	and she can't wear her ring at the moment
C	no
B	ah
C	they had all those jokes though when they had to cut it off
C	she doesn't wanna be my wifey any more
B	that must have been quite hard for them actually with the
C	I know
B	but I guess he can put it back together again somehow
C	oh yeah
B	oh with that
C	you get it enlarged or
B	yeah
C	I think it's easily done but it's more of the
B	yeah
C	so where do you want to get married? Have you  have you  actually started?
B	in in Hereford
C	oh right
B	this is the other thing though because my family are Catholic
C	really?
B	he doesn't want to
C	what is it you want about a Catholic church marriage?
B	just because I dunno it's more of childhood thing
C	oh
B	and it's a really lovely building and it's in a really
C	mm
B	he just doesn't really agree with Catholicism
C	really?
B	which is fair enough
C	yeah
B	rather than making him go through a ceremony that he just doesn't want to do
C	mm
B	but
C	that's weird cos I'm not religious but I wouldn't actually rule out getting married in a religious institution if it was gorgeous
B	yeah well I think it's cos cos it's the Catholic church
C	oh right
B	if it was Church of England I don't think he'd have as many issues
C	and he's okay with you being Catholic?
B	yeah yeah he's fine with that
C	are you  are you  practising?
B	yeah not so much any more
C	mm mm
B	and but when I was travelling I went quite a bit
C	mm
B	yeah it was
C	ah
B	but it's fine
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah definitely
B	erm but as long as it's in Hereford then I don't mind
A	can I have a soup now?
C	yeah go for it
A	no I've been doing stuff upstairs
C	you missed out on
A	oh
B	do they make it all there?
C	mm
A	no they make it in town somewhere
C	oh okay
B	oh
A	Cos they've got a bake the well a bakery I should think
C	mm
A	I don't know how to describe it
C	yeah
B	oh okay
C	coffee and cake
B	yeah
C	and we had a
A	did you have a citron?
C	no we didn't cos we had lemon meringue pie yesterday so
B	mm
C	kind of citroned out
B	oh go on then
C	got to finish the  bit
B	thank you
C	and we had the apricot tart
A	that sounds
C	and the apple and blackberry tart
B	mm
C	ah
B	did your mum like it?
C	she loved it
B	ah yum
C	and it's got a lovely custard base to it
B	ah
C	the fruit's so tangy
C	they've got a place in
B	yeah
C	I think that might have been the original one
B	oh okay
C	mm
A	no the original one is already
C	oh is it?
A	and the
B	ah so
C	she is
B	oh my God
A	what's this rubbish?
C	I think they have both erm both him and his brother have all the different venues together
A	the

C	mm mm
B	mm
C	well she was on her was to work and just stopped in for a coffee but ended up getting snowed in at the café
B	hmm mm
C	and so she just decided to work from the caé on her laptop
B	wow
C	it's like would you like a coffee or a cake? Or would you like to marry me?
B	that's a proper romantic story
C	it is isn't it

C	oh
B	oh we didn't go there

C	it was the year before wasn't it?
B	yeah yeah
C	that was when we all got dressed up
B	and gatecrashed parties
C	we did
B	we we went to someone's party but I don't know who it was
C	we went to two different parties in
B	yeah
C	And then yeah we went to
B	I've just got this brilliant picture when
B	which she was drinking at one of the parties
C	do you remember that guy at the at
B	oh yeah
C	Cos everybody was like really animated and happy and drinking and dancing
C	we all cheekily got our photos taken with him didn't we?

C	oh back in our youth
B	I know
C	it's crazy
B	mm
A	who do you class as everyone?
C	everyone
A	bet
B	she wants to
B	I think it's just an awkward situation isn't it
C	no there's definitely been some discourse there
B	oh okay
B	oh that's good
C	little things as well
B	mm
A	yeah see isn't there some parental thing going on
B	yeah yeah
C	do they not know that she's getting married with him?
B	no no
C	oh
B	so the families don't' know
B	yeah
A	mm
C	I knew he was Pakistani
B	mm
C	of Pakistani origin but I didn't
B	so yeah that's why it's I think there's a few issues with
C	oh dear
B	that's like I think she she wants all that but
C	yeah
B	she needs to tell her parents first really
C	but her parents are lovely aren't they? Wouldn't they?
A	yeah but they're quite old school
B	yeah they are
C	really? I suppose
B	they'd want her to marry a Sikh man
C	really?
B	definitely not a Muslim
C	ah
A	mm mm
B	no
C	I just don't agree with that kind of
B	no
A	but they'd let her marry an Englishman
B	yeah they'd be more accepting over that than a Muslim
C	well Faisal Faisal's a total Englishman really isn't he?
B	but he asked her once kind of in jest
A	God
[ANNOTATION]	she will marry an Englishman	Neutral
B	so he obviously has kind of traditional values as well
C	really?
B	so as much as you know they want it to be easy I think both of them have kind of got these I dunno religious and cultural values that
C	what a shame
B	I know
C	it's all gonna go really like Romeo and Juliet on us
A	I hope they don't both die

C	ah
B	but he's he's got a he has the whole turban and the beard doesn't he?

B	yeah and I always think it's going to be really complicated but it's not really is it?
C	yep

A	broccoli Stilton
B	mm
C	mm

C	well
A	I know it'd be rude not to
[ANNOTATION]	A bowl of soup made by Speaker B's mother has more than 700 calories.	Neutral
C	have you seen? Her room's just walled with shelving

B	oh okay
C	and they've got a really friendly local police officer
B	yeah
C	community police officers actually you know interacting and
B	yeah
C	er in a nice way and helpful way
B	yeah
C	because most of it's happening on Ebay and online and
A	mm
B	mm
C	I guess it's difficult to track
B	yeah
C	but it's slightly disconcerting having debt collectors writing you letters saying
B	yeah
A	we used to get debt letters for ex-housemates
C	ha really?
C	do you actually phone them up and say look they don't live here any more or
A	well there's not much you can do
