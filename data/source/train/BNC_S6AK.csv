B	mm
C	that'll be
A	are you?
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	and I haven't got anywhere booked yet

B	oh it's a not very good picture though is it?
C	no just I just want the
B	no well it isn't anyway
A	you want the information
C	just want the information
A	sixteenth century manor house
B	but it doesn't look like it there does it? at all? looks like a
C	probably just set back it's probably
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	must be a difficult way to take a photo
C	so
B	yeah
C	gets a bit congested with traffic in certain areas
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	erm
B	they they haven't they're not doing
A	no
B	they did it last year
A	mm yeah
B	and we thought we'll stay at
A	yeah
A	they've just got
B	we didn't have that one either
A	there are so many youth hostels got shut down like
B	mm
A	it's not it's not
B	they are changing quite a lot aren't they?
A	a business to make lots of money
C	they have to make money don't they?
A	well they just spent over a million pound on a youth hostel in Cambridge
C	mm
B	they are unique
A	they're so unique it's untrue
B	yeah
A	but you know all they're doing is now changing them into guest houses if you like great big hotel type places
B	mm
A	where you can get grub and be fed and what have you
B	they'll still keep the others won't they?
A	well hopefully if they can get enough er volunteers
C	yeah
A	oh they'll always be busy yeah
C	you know with the dales and things like that
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	the Yorkshire
A	yes
C	I suppose it's the ones in cities that they have the problems with
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	mm
A	no
B	it wasn't very
C	the one in
A	oh that was awful
B	yeah yeah
A	awful
C	no they built houses they built flats on there so
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and er
A	but er they're run by managers full full time
B	but they were talking about getting one on the Broads
A	yeah a new one
A	talking about getting a new one
B	doing one there cos
C	yeah
B	and that would be a a good area to do one really
A	well there's only two youth hostels in the whole of Norfolk
C	so what
A	yeah
B	mm
C	mm
B	mm they did have
A	no we never went there
B	just a house on the street you know?
A	yeah
C	yeah it gotta have some
B	you can't just have
C	and they've gotta
B	yeah
A	yeah they've gotta wifi they gotta have all that sorta stuff
B	and now we're going to have to make beds
A	and now they want us to make instead of putting all the
A	the linen out they want
C	they want you to make them
A	us to make
B	I wrote to them and said we don't usually get out till about one anyway
A	no
B	erm
C	that's that's the whole point of it
A	I don't know if they can
B	especially bunk beds
C	yeah
B	to do
A	yeah
B	especially the bottom sheet
C	and yeah
B	erm
A	I don't know whether they're going to do it yet
A	next year yeah
B	but we were sent a little thing saying what do we think?
A	but we said
B	put our
C	that's a lot of stuff to do
A	well if you've gotta make twenty odd beds a day
C	with quilt with quilts and covers and
A	yeah
C	if you have quilt covers and things
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and maybe this is a ploy to get the ones that have have to be volunteered
B	but they're lots they can't shut down can they?
A	yeah some of them they can't shut down they've got to be youth hostels
A	they can't sell them
A	er has got a covenant on
B	mm
A	they try to sell it they can only get a pound for it
C	right
A	because that was given by these
C	yeah
A	you know?
B	but the ones that have erm National Trust quite
A	yeah
B	you know? what for really but
A	but some of them
B	it's a shame
C	they'll make money they'll make
A	yeah
B	mm
C	National Trust will make more money out of them
A	yeah they would
C	their
B	yeah
C	National Trust cottages are expensive
B	yeah
A	they are
B	so they're only on lease for the moment
A	well some some of the youth hostels have been taken over by private people
B	mm
A	the Youth Hostel Association
B	they're still
A	mm
B	which would be quite nice if we
A	I mean we did go in where where's that one we went in that that needed an awful amount of work I think
B	erm
A	very damp
B	at
B	yeah it's only that was only twelve beds that one
A	that was only twelve beds that
B	right in the middle of the woods
A	in the middle of the
B	lovely it's a lovely cottage
A	yeah
B	lovely cottage
B	but er
A	god it needed work
B	because the walls how they are there's all these creepy for
A	yeah
B	all
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
C	they'd have to
B	mm
A	but er
B	there's so many spiders
A	I mean there was spiders everywhere
B	well
C	that's what it's for though innit?
B	old stone
A	yeah
B	cottage
A	yeah
B	yeah that's what it's for
A	brilliant place we liked it didn't we?
B	yes
A	walking in the forest
B	yeah
A	you couldn't get lost there because the A3
B	yeah we didn't know about that
A	but you could hear it when we were in the woods
B	yeah
A	you could hear but they now put a tunnel
B	was it big enough? no
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	the tube line yeah I saw someone but yeah
C	ah amazing
A	yeah
B	mm
C	absolutely amazing
A	yeah
C	all the tunnels are now
A	yeah and er
B	oh
C	they're all dug
A	yeah
C	lay all the tracks and everything
A	cor
B	mm
C	great big boring machine the way that it does it
A	they're huge
B	yeah
A	they and and they
A	yeah
C	amazing I cos I showed
A	oh yeah
C	and the so the idea is the accuracy that they have to bend the paper they have to fold it
B	oh right
C	and then they have to make the keystone to put in and then we put weights on to see
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	what isn't
A	yeah
C	and what happens if you don't have the pillar either side
A	that's it yeah
C	in the thing
B	mm
C	something on TV about it
A	all together yeah
C	so I show them that old technology's still being used
A	yeah
C	even now
A	yes it is yeah
B	right
A	yeah
C	but they some of the areas they have to drain
A	yeah
C	there's so much water behind they have to put great big taps in
A	yeah they've
C	to take the water way
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	amazing
A	yeah
A	they've come across a burial ground too haven't they?
A	yeah
C	which they think was the
A	yeah
C	but there was this arch
A	oh right
C	but when they started
A	oh crikey
B	oh
C	and
A	yeah
C	it took longer to get out because the way the concrete was made and the pressure that'd been put on
A	yeah
C	had really made it tight and it just wouldn't just wouldn't snap
A	wouldn't budge
B	no
C	and then there was one bit that goes under the docks
A	did they
C	so that they could put
C	the new tunnel in
A	yeah
C	and it's one of the big exos exhibition centres down there
C	could be used which was like a military show where
B	wow
C	army boats navy boats went up etcetera
C	and they just did it on time
A	couldn't get it out
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	gosh
C	they're I mean absolutely
A	when was that built
C	eighteen something
A	yeah
C	it was and it used to have
A	was it down by Brunel or something like that?
C	something like that yeah
A	yeah cos he was a fantastic engineer weren't he?
C	but it was like and it's got it's got a name
A	yeah?
C	erm
A	yeah you have yeah
C	all the escalators where they go
A	yeah
B	mm
C	literally
A	yeah
C	amazing
A	yes
B	yeah
A	they were digging that way they were digging that way
C	yeah
A	millimetres out
C	yeah
A	when they dug
C	amazing
B	mm
C	and it's just so many people working on it
A	yeah
C	you know so many people working on the whole line
A	fantastic innit I mean when you think about the work and the and the brains that go into it all
C	you know and there's a guy who this is gonna be his last tunnel
A	wow
B	yes
C	and his sons are into it as well
A	yeah
C	and he's
A	yeah
C	helped build that and a couple of other
B	yeah
C	so but he's it's the biggest engineering project in Europe
A	is it?
B	is it?
C	at the moment
A	oh wow
C	now you these machines that come from Germany are just amazing
A	but when you see
B	mm
A	the the underground system as it is
C	yeah
B	it's an amazing system
A	that's that's nearly as bad as India
C	the amount of traffic that goes through
A	traffic go through yeah
C	amazing when you think about all the people that are moving and
A	yeah
C	stuff
B	mm
C	absolutely amazing
A	and and er
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	mm
C	it's quite good fun when you're
A	cos more people now use
C	yeah
A	because their own transport is too expensive
C	you just can't get about
A	no
C	you just can't get about
C	er kind of explained about the girls he says
A	it is yeah
C	so he says I came from the other side of London

B	mm
C	you didn't have to worry about
A	yeah
C	you know?
B	yeah you just go to the bus stop and wait
C	just go to the bus and wait
B	mm
C	you know I said well I said my daughter I said if I she has to be at work for nine o'clock
A	no
B	mm
C	so it's like half seven
A	yes
C	and then it gets there at half eight which is
A	that's it
B	mm
A	the buses used to run every ten minutes?
C	yeah I think they stilll do
A	what down at
C	yeah
B	they they do in
C	in
A	every ten minutes
C	I was
B	mm
C	I was surprised about
A	yeah
C	you could get a bus at
A	out here it's every hour
C	yeah
A	every hour
B	mm
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	not good at all
B	and then you can't get one back after
C	at a certain time
B	quite late

C	no you can
B	no it's a bit later than that
C	no last bus back
A	is it?
B	oh is it?
A	oh right
B	oh right
A	oh I thought it was
B	that's more than
A	I thought it was between five and six
B	than erm
C	that's the last one back
B	mm
A	that'd be packed wouldn't it?
C	no you'd think it is but it isn't cos people just don't bother
A	no
C	no
A	yeah
C	no
A	it goes straight along the road
C	yeah
B	mm
C	so the
A	oh
C	I think half seven I think
A	back
C	half seven I think yeah
B	mm
C	so
A	yeah
C	so it balances it out
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
C	but no
A	well it is run by the city council and the buses
C	it's private isn't it?
A	cos the
C	connect you got Connect and First Direct
A	Connect
C	it depends on
A	er most of them are subsidised by the
C	yeah yeah it's a nice bus station
C	all bus stations used to be like that haven't they?
A	yeah
C	used to just be a bit of
A	yeah
C	all bus stations are like that
A	that was a hole and now it's really nice isn't it?
B	yeah
C	I always remember the
A	oh god

A	what?
C	and he goes through it
A	oh right
C	and do it
A	no you're not
C	you know? if you make a
A	yeah
C	if you don't have the experience
A	no chance
C	and
C	of course they was like
B	yeah
C	I said because if you use the marking knife
A	you've good start
C	you've got a good start for when you put your tenon saw in
A	yeah
C	and you've actually got somewhere the er tenon saw can go in
A	yeah
C	and of course for the people that
B	yeah
C	well maybe just a pencil
A	yeah
C	you'd get a
A	yeah
C	then of course it's like oh couldn't give the kids a marking knife
A	yeah
C	they will be using them
B	mm
C	and then he went
A	uhu
C	and I go and I though oh I'm not gonna say anything here cos this is just not right

C	a mortise gauge has two pins because you set the size of your mortise
A	your mortise yeah

B	yeah
C	and I just thought oh this is
B	yeah
C	tick tick tick tick tick
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	that's
A	yeah
C	updated mine four years ago
B	yeah
C	cos I got quite a few
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	well I never
B	mm

A	no?
B	oh
C	I watched the guy use a push stick
A	yeah
C	so you can put it on the edge of the wood
