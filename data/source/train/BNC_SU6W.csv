B	yeah we're recording now
A	shall we check that it works?
B	no it'll be fine
A	okay
B	most like to change
A	that's not a personality trait
B	well it probably isn't no
A	oh well I think it's a virtue being able to admit to one's faults isn't it?
B	what would I like to change? Yeah I suppose it would be it would be good but then you see if you've got the faults and you know what they are why don't you do something about them? That's the
A	well
B	that's embarrassing then isn't it
A	well not necessarily
A	I the what I'd most like to change is my sort of temper stroke speaking before I engage my brain
B	oh
A	and it's really really hard but I think I'm definitely better
B	oh I don't think it's quite that much honey
A	well it is definitely better than it was
B	yeah
A	but it's still
B	well that reminds me  that reminds me  of a a flaw that I used to have and obviously don't have any more though my my describing it is never er as not having it any more it is in fact an instance of it
A	it's arrogance
B	well it is actually yes
A	yeah you're definitely better than you used to be
B	yes I used to think I knew everything and that everyone else was silly and um yeah I think I've stopped believing that now and I think I'm one could be secure in one's ideas
A	yeah certainly take pride in yourself
B	and yet also open to other people's
A	yeah definitely
B	and and you do have to judge people and see if they know if they have reason valid in their ideas
A	yeah
B	um but you know you have to accept that everyone's got their own independent ideas and how they've arrived at them is often a bit different from yours
A	yes
B	um but it but you mustn't be go the other way and be on self-conflict
A	no
B	what's the opposite of arrogant?
A	er well
B	simpering perhaps or is that too much?
A	no no no no no that's not no
B	oh okay modest yeah that sounds about right
A	erm but I think it's a fine line because I think arrogance is clearly sort of an unattractive trait with people
B	yeah
A	Cos it just feels as if they're looking for you to say no you're not really you're brilliant
A	and that's annoying
B	ah yes
A	and not this it's um quite hard
B	I'm sure there's a line of poetry I can't remember which is along the lines of um
A	that's probably from If or something isn't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	where you you're honest about yourself basically
A	mm
B	er yeah well that's a good thing to have
A	yeah
B	so I suppose still sometimes arrogant
A	did you apologise afterwards?
B	yeah I did later you know
A	oh good
B	but we're all in the same barrel there and it's because if it happens to be a bad day and everyone's in and there's no chairs then it's just
A	yeah
B	and er you think why do I have to fight for the right to sit down and get on with my job
A	yeah
B	so I'm giving that job up soon which is a good thing
A	that's good
B	yeah anyway
A	Good right
B	oh yes I'd love to ask you a question
A	actually you did propose to me when I was wearing tracksuit bottoms
B	yeah well that that that bird is won I thought funnily
A	that's gonna that's going to present a lovely image isn't it
B	yeah
A	ooh
B	where would you go and what would you do?
A	ooh
B	isn't it
A	A spiritual journey?
B	yeah What is that?
A	well I'll tell you what I
B	it doesn't have to be spas does it? Just go and
A	no although that could be interesting as such
B	that's what comes to my mind anyway go on
A	what I actually this is quite funny but when I think of when you say spiritual I think of religion
B	do you?
A	what I have done a couple of times is um on Good Friday in London they have a well march isn't the right word but they have a sort of procession
B	mm mm
A	that goes from oh the Methodist outside the Methodist hall
B	mm
A	up to
B	oh right
A	so I went there one time
B	mm
A	and then I went another time with my mum
B	mm
A	um cos I think
B	why is that do you think?
A	well I think the crucifixion story is so moving and
B	mm
A	he was er he gave a little talk
B	I guess you could take it to mean some place that you go not because you wanna see the sites or have a rest but somewhere where you go to enhance your your spirit where you go purely for sort of
A	yeah
B	so what would you say?
A	huh
B	maybe you should
A	maybe I should
B	mm
A	um
B	yeah I I picked this out cos I wasn't sure what my own answer was and thought it was an interesting question
A	yeah
B	your consciousness and your your feelings about yourself and um yeah it's a good question
A	but I think on the other hand I mean you could um I think if you  if you  think of a figure that you really really admire
B	biographies
A	um about and so cos you said to me and you said to me yeah read a biography and a biography of people you admire and you said you read that in the morning so that you'd start the day
B	mm mm
A	you'd read it over breakfast and you'd start the day feeling inspired
B	yeah
A	which I think was brilliant and um that in a way could be it's not I don't think it's what we'd sort of traditionally think of as spiritual but if it's something that gives you more motivation more sort of zest for life then well why not?
B	mm
A	yes
B	and I would go there purely with the purpose of trying to enhance my er enjoyment of life through art and I definitely would I'd consider that
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah that as well
A	we should do that we should go back there
A	the Euro's good this year apparently
B	it's better than it was
A	it's supposed to be a good year for going to Europe because the Euro has has gone down finally
B	yeah
A	mm
B	yeah we should go and write that down as a suggestion for a holiday
A	no we should if this
B	it's true
A	I mean if this barge thing isn't going to work out then maybe we should go to Florence
B	yeah
A	A different sort of barge
B	someone else does all the punting as well
A	yeah
B	yeah spiritual that's interesting but then on the other hand see what's the opposite? The opposite of spiritual is material
A	but then if you're really you know what it's like if you're really um say you've had a really hard time at work and you're just all you can feel physically sort of
A	oh dear that's my phone
B	not really
A	okay
B	well I'm just reading out the question it says spiritual journey so not spiritual relaxation
A	yeah okay
B	spiritual journey implies er you know a beginning and an end and it's
A	I can't see myself going I can't see myself doing meditation or going to a convent or or any anything traditionally spiritual
B	no
A	I don't really feel
B	you know you could have a spiritual journey on the barge through the you know er through the  through the  English countryside if you
A	you mean hug a tree?
B	yeah something like that
A	yeah you could do but um anyway
B	anyway let's do another one
A	okay
B	oh it's your turn now
A	right let's have a look
B	what?
A	is there only one soul mate for each person?
B	well there is for me at the moment and I would  I would  not expect there to be anyone that could equal your wonderfulness darling so
A	ah
B	um I don't know is it true if you know something
A	yeah but do you think that?
B	I mean why would that be true what it says in the question? Only if you believe in some higher power that's picked people out to be pairs which I don't
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but you I think you
B	we have changed
A	yeah you grow more towards or apart from each other
B	yeah
A	um
B	mm
A	well it's a sort of romantic idea isn't it
B	well why is it romantic?
A	maybe it isn't
B	yeah
A	maybe it's more romantic that there isn't
B	yeah well I think it's more romantic to say that you know as we've just you you've just said you have to work towards it
A	it's it's like that thing thing from Louis De Bernieres
B	oh yes
A	yeah
B	was older than her yeah you said
A	um quite sort of sensible and then when she um started when she finished her relationship with him and then she went she started going out with other people she became much less so um much less sort of she was more sort of
B	did she mirror the people she went out with?
A	yes she did and I think at the same time it that that she split up with her um her original boyfriend I met you and we sort of I I could see quite clearly that we sort of became less alike because I became more like you and she became more like her
B	yeah
A	yes it is
B	right
A	please don't think I'm rude if I read my text message while you're you know
B	oh how shocking
A	oh this is from
B	oh yeah what does it say?
B	oh yeah
A	had tea at had lunch at Fortnum and Mason and then a tour around West Minister Abbey
B	mm
A	I hope that she got my message I hope I didn't leave it no I couldn't have left it on the wrong phone
B	oh well she's um said something now that's good
A	but she's yeah good
B	that's good yeah
A	ah ha ha ha
B	similar to the question we did the other day but not quite the same thing
A	to visit
B	it's not about where you were born you just get to visit and come back so imagine you had a time machine and you could jump in it and it wouldn't cost you anything and you could go in and you could do what you wanted to
B	what would you the most curious to go and witness
A	ahh
B	but you only have a couple of weeks is what we're saying
A	yeah
B	so you get to be at a certain time at a certain place for two weeks
A	erm
B	I better think about my own answer actually
A	that's really  that's really  interesting
B	mm
A	oh I'll tell you what it'd be nice  it'd be nice  to well I was going to say it would be nice to go to do things of biblical times
B	oh yeah like what?
A	see Jesus
B	well there you go now that would be interesting
A	that would be fun
B	that would be really interesting
A	very fun wouldn't it
B	you could find out some of the facts wouldn't you
A	mm
B	God that would be fun then you could come back and tell everybody what was actually true
A	yes
B	he was a very bad carpenter or he kept hitting his thumb or something
B	I don't know
A	um well it that's right in some ways I'd like to go back to a really really early period because I don't know about you but sometimes this sounds really stupid but
B	mm mm
A	sometime with really  with really  early periods of history although obviously we know they're factual because you know there's evidence for them
B	yeah
A	but I kind of think well they're so far away that I can't imagine that they were real
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I know they were but anyway
B	sure
A	but then
B	mm
A	I kind of think I'd be quite interesting to to to go um say when I kind of think it's quite nice to visit around Tudor times when Henry the Eighth was on the throne
B	yeah
A	erm
B	you don't have to live there don't forget
A	no
B	this is only a question of being there
A	oh oh I'm really not sure
B	just for just to be somewhere
A	um
B	I don't think in this  in this  scenario you can actually be anybody you want you can just imagine that you can visit
A	no
B	and they wouldn't see you as being a foreigner or whatever
A	yes
B	you could just witness something
A	yeah
B	I suppose you could ask people questions and stuff when you were there
A	yeah
B	as if you were a local
A	mm
B	I
A	Cos that would be
B	really?
A	I mean the first sort of
B	yeah
A	anyway
B	yeah then you'd be round er the period of Shakespeare
A	ooh
B	imagine seeing one of Shakespeare's plays put on for the first time
A	that would be interesting yeah
B	yeah
A	oh yeah that would be really good yeah
B	just like in Shakespeare in Love but the real thing you know with the first presentation
A	yeah
B	Cos he wrote you know Shakespeare wrote the plays with these people in mind as actors
A	yeah
B	he wrote it for them because he knew their strengths and wanted to show them off and vice versa
A	okay
B	that would be amazing actually
A	yeah
B	yeah that's true
A	ooh yeah that would be bliss
B	the the ideal thing is to want to be on the moon yourself but I don't think that's included in the question
A	no
B	it's not like being the astronaut
A	but can you imagine how their wives must have felt er and their families
B	stressed out
A	absolutely ah
B	and all the TV coverage and some of the press it must have been very difficult
A	yeah it must have been a nightmare
B	yeah yeah
A	I don't think many of them managed to survive unfortunately
B	no
A	um
B	no but there was a lot of pressure  lot of pressure  on them
A	oh and there was this huge I think when they came back from the moon the men were all like sort of celebrities and oh the temptation
B	the trouble is when more time goes on like that when no one else has been there the more it's sort of hyped up
A	yeah
B	because it is still exceptional what they've done
A	oh sorry going back to the last period
B	mm
A	sorry I'm changing the subject now
B	that's alright
A	you know going back to the period in history we're still on the same question actually
B	yeah yeah
A	when I um used to teach there was a question we use to do a similar thing to these to promote conversation and there was a question
B	mm mm
A	that said if you slightly different if you could go back in history and change one thing what would it be?
B	oh yeah
A	and I hadn't thought of this but almost everyone said and now say what you think they would say
B	they would say er kill Adolf Hitler as a
A	yes
B	yes I knew that
A	I I didn't think of that but they all said they would kill Adolf Hitler or stop him being born
B	yeah
A	I never thought of that
B	he was very very bad person but the ideas if you know enough about German history which I arrogantly I think I do
A	oh yeah
B	maybe not quite with as much charisma but they want the the the it was such a statused institution Germany
A	mm
B	so um he was in the right place at the right time no doubt about it but you know the Nazi party wasn't him and everyone going oh Hitler's so brilliant and so strong I hadn't thought of that
A	oh
B	which um was essentially about making Germany bigger for the sake of it
A	mm
B	yeah
A	okay
B	do a quick one
[ANNOTATION]	Nobody was in the right place at the right time.	Contradiction
A	um is it you or me?
B	you
A	erm oh okay right here's right you get a minute to answer this question
B	yep
A	if money were no object what
B	what kind of party?
A	yeah
B	I would throw a party in Outer Space
A	I thought you'd say that
B	or at least be in the light atmosphere if anyone wants to be practical
[ANNOTATION]	Someone wants to throw a birthday party.	Neutral
A	okay well what what springs to mind when I was reading that Alice King book she wrote about um a party I think it was for
B	ah
A	or I just have this I have this vision of this sort of beautiful summer evening everyone looking gorgeous
B	mm mm
A	in beautiful gardens in France
B	oh okay
A	with loads of Champagne
A	yeah
B	you can have a like made up one
A	yeah there you go
B	that's a brilliant one
[ANNOTATION]	Nobody talking has read any books by Alice King.	Contradiction
A	okay that's probably enough of that isn't it?
B	jolly good
[ANNOTATION]	Somebody mentioned throwing a party in the winter.	Contradiction
