B	so like you're hanging upside down?
A	so you're your arms are there your knees are you've kind of twisted your arms around
B	like this?
C	ooh
A	like that and your knees are on the hoop like that and then you er get one leg up so one leg is pointing up and one leg is pointing down

C	ouch
A	but it looks really good
