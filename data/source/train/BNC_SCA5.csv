B	can I have one of those please?
A	shall we walk round the other way?
B	what backwards?
B	okay
A	yeah
B	look at the signs  Apple blossom day
A	when's apple blossom day then?
B	dunno
A	oh it's like a
B	fish?
A	oh well maybe here
B	alright
A	ring the bottle and you get a fish
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	yeah you haven't been allowed those in ages have you?
A	yeah
B	really?
A	but there was er
B	mm
A	I didn't think they were mistreated though
B	pet shop
A	just as long as you carry it home gently
B	yeah but you go to a pet shop with the sole intention of buying a fish
A	and looking after it
B	whereas if you go to a fair you might just be going for a laugh
A	and then you've got a fish and no tank
B	and then you've got a fish and you don't want it
B	you're just gonna flush it down the loo or something
A	yeah I suppose
B	mm
A	oh
A	lost
B	yeah
A	there's a  there's a  boy up in Scotland
A	how can people forget?
B	I don't know
A	people forget
B	I know there's millions isn't there
A	yeah
A	mm it's easy enough to do
B	yeah
A	I've bought lottery tickets before and forgotten I've bought them and then
B	yeah
A	but I usually find them and I've got nothing on them anyway
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I hope the microphone doesn't er pick up all the wind
A	yeah
B	have to listen to it when we get back
A	yeah my hands are cold
B	what does that do?
A	it's different to the walnuts that we eat
B	black walnuts?
A	they help
B	reinforces the enamel?
A	yeah
B	hm
A	ferret
B	it looks like a
A	ferret
B	it's pretty squished isn't it
A	oh don't look at it
B	it looks like a meercat
A	I suppose meercats are similar to ferrets
B	yeah
A	they're big now
B	yeah
A	they grow so fast
B	that's cos he heard me say they're ready to eat
B	I've just entered a competition
A	yeah
B	it had
A	sheep?
B	no man dressed as a
A	oh right
B	my caption was
A	does he do anything with the rabbit or he's just standing
B	no he's just standing there
A	Obama's bunny
B	talking at the microphone
A	erm
B	what was it?
A	what the rabbit is in the
B	no no
B	not sophisticated but
B	it was funny though
A	well it sounds like it might have been funny if you could remember it
A	what so what d'you win?
B	I dunno
A	White rabbit costume
A	Obama gets the wrong idea when he's told to get  to get  a white hair
B	no I had I wrote it
A	right
B	so yeah I've just about recovered from yesterday
A	yesterday? Why
B	yeah
A	oh beers
B	well from beers in the afternoon
B	seriously can't do it
A	I only had a few pints and I was
B	oh dear
A	you had a nap
B	well yeah I had to
A	yeah that's not good
B	we'll have to be very careful when the er for the party
A	yeah I know I was thinking about that
B	not gonna start drinking til the sun goes down
A	no I was thinking I need to stay away from the beer altogether
B	yeah
A	and drink something else
B	yeah
A	I need
B	I know
A	Cos the last thing you want is to feel drained or
B	yeah
A	I was talking to
B	yeah
A	but oh we
B	well it's not a problem is it
A	well it is cos it you've got to have enough food for everybody
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A only had a few beers.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	it's
B	just something to do
A	oh and
[ANNOTATION]	There will be a party.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	and I've never even tried to make them
B	yeah
A	so said make some samosas and put them in the freezer and then see if they work quite well heating them up from the freezer
B	oh okay and yeah
A	and then
B	that's a good idea
A	then we can make batches now
B	yeah
A	and put them all in the freezer ready
B	save panicking at the end
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has never made samosas before.	Entailment
A	I'm going after zumba I'm going a with Mum to Dereham
B	yep
A	so we need to work out how many we want
B	yeah
A	and er what colours
B	yeah
A	so mainly red but I think a couple of white ones might be quite nice somewhere
[ANNOTATION]	A is going to do cardio with their mother.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	or do you want all red?
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	quite nice
[ANNOTATION]	A has been going to zumba for two years now.	Neutral
A	so shall I go for all red?
B	yeah
A	no
B	cos they're not that powerful are they
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and um and work out which ones
B	yeah
A	we need them now cos otherwise we will panic
B	yeah
A	and they might go up in price over the summer cos everybody will be having barbeques and stuff
B	yeah and I was thinking we need to plan like the actual day what time things are gonna happen
A	yeah
B	Cos I need to make the playlists for the music
A	yeah
B	for different periods
A	yeah
B	music played before the band
A	are you gonna put them all on
B	and then er after the band
A	if you put them all on separate CDs like dinner music
B	yeah
A	and then
B	but we need to think what kind of atmosphere we wanna create
A	yeah
B	in those times
A	and then I need a salsa section
B	salsa?
A	just like
B	yeah well that's the thing it's gonna be difficult mixing the genres
A	well
A	the salsa section
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	the programme I've got doesn't do it
A	that that
B	mixing?
A	A scratch mixer
B	yeah
A	and then it's got these turntables
B	yeah
A	and you don't have to have a um er record on them or anything
B	oh I've got  I've got  like a virtual DJ
A	oh no it's a real one
B	huh? Oh he's got a real one
A	A real one
B	oh okay
A	and it's it's a fake
B	oh you can record it yeah?
A	I guess so
B	Cos I don't want to be doing it on the night
A	no
B	the trouble is though you need
A	yeah
B	that's the problem I've got cos we've only go the one sound card
A	yeah
B	when you try and mix it's just guessing
A	yes you
B	you haven't got the the distinction between the two outputs
A	well I think he's I think that's what he does
B	okay
A	sO we've got to speak to
B	alright
A	oh we're going to their house on Saturday
B	yeah
A	for the barbeque
B	okay we'll try and nick it then
A	maybe er if I call him up and say and check with him
B	yeah
A	or you could call him up check with him
B	yeah
A	so that we can have a play
B	okay
A	and then he can show you how it all works and
B	well I know how it works
A	I know  I know  you know how it works but ah you know what I mean
B	yeah
A	it he's been using it well he's been playing with it for a while
B	well it's just
A	well phone him up and find out
B	it's gonna  it's gonna  take ages cos I'm not the world's greatest mixer
A	on top of it
B	on top of that
A	like yeah
B	and then use that file and keep going like that
A	no
B	so it's gonna take bloody ages
A	yeah
B	plus we need to find a
A	well you never know maybe he he might let us if we have play with it on Saturday and if it works maybe he'll lend it to us for a week
B	yeah
A	it would be good
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	into different kind of sections now
A	so if if you have time this week before Saturday to like put the songs in the order kind of that you want
B	well I haven't got to that stage
A	yeah
B	like dinner music or
A	yeah
B	building creating a party atmosphere kind of music or
A	looking at the audience
B	they can
A	yeah
B	put music to suit that
A	no
B	so we're gonna have to try and create the atmosphere through the music
A	yeah but then you've got the whole section
B	yeah
A	so they they're gonna do that part so that will be a nice change of
B	yeah
A	they'll be reading the  they'll be reading the
B	well I dunno I think
A	what goes best
B	yeah but before like the first and second set they're gonna be playing just stuff from the iPod
A	yeah in between
B	yeah
A	but shouldn't you just let them do it do what they want
B	yeah but I mean they might have a load of shit on there
A	hm
B	I don't know if I'd rather have control of that as well
A	hm
B	and say look between your sets could you just stick this CD on
A	maybe that's when we could have a salsa section
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	well not rocky rocky but you know things like The Strokes and White Stripes and that kinda stuff
A	okay
B	um
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	do you think or do you think we be too busy yapping and socialising to do that
B	well that's it probably I mean
A	couldn't we just go wahay can you put the salsa CD on?
B	yeah
A	maybe we could do that
B	yeah
A	or
B	what just create a whole stack of CDs and then
A	yeah
B	I don't know if we would have time
A	mm
B	yeah
B	that kind of thing to think about
A	mm
B	yeah
A	like the food and stuff it's like we've got to delegate some people
B	which way d'you want to go?
A	Down here
B	yeah
A	and say to Uncle Brian Could you do us a favour? Could you
B	yeah
A	but that
B	no
A	we're gonna have to think about it
B	yeah
A	you're welcome to come
B	yeah
A	what and suddenly say Oh I can't come
A	no
B	yeah well it happens though doesn't it
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	if it all
B	no it'll be fine
A	yeah I know but
B	ah the main problem is the weather
A	oh I have
B	what?
A	I ordered flooring for the marquee
B	have you?
A	and I didn't tell anybody
B	what?
A	because it was like thirty quid or something and I just thought well wouldn't that be better
B	well okay
A	you can cancel it if you like
B	no well we need a stage as well don't we?
A	ah yeah
B	no the flooring will
A	if we've got the flooring the stage isn't that important is it? Cos they can stand just on the floor
B	yeah I suppose
A	I dunno
B	yeah
A	I didn't mean to it just kind of like when I was ticking the boxes and I just thought
B	what the hell is that?
A	and I
B	what was it?
A	no seriously is that alright cos we if you  if you  don't want it I'll cancel it
B	well
A	I think it was thirty pounds
B	well that's okay then
A	but I just thought
B	yeah well it would be better for my brother's wheelchair
A	maybe
B	and if it's raining then it'll just turn into
A	there's
B	like a Glastonbury mud fest
A	yeah
B	so
A	well there's your brother in the wheelchair and there's people who have got sticks and stuff
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and it kind of moulds to the shape of the earth
B	yeah
A	sorry
A	this way
B	are we going for the long one?
A	well we can always cancel it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and are they one's where you can wash your hands?
A	yep
B	okay
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	I'll have to check
B	no
A	I hope not  hope not
B	I hope not as well cos
A	Cos if everybody's camping
B	yeah they need
A	they need a sink
B	yeah
A	I'm sure I emailed and said Does it have a vanity section?
B	yeah well he knows
A	yeah
B	but I know it's not the same guy who's doing the toilets is it? He's just kind of acting as a go between
A	yeah and I wonder if we can
B	so just as long as he relays the message to him
A	we might be able to
B	yeah
A	so that there's an extra mirror just for people walking past to like just check they haven't got black eyes or something
B	yeah
A	and the men
B	yeah
A	right yeah I think I've got to that
B	yeah
A	Cos both the marquee and the band want their payments the rest
B	upfront
A	the rest of the payments once they arrive
B	yeah
A	so
B	well I'll
A	that's gonna be a lot of cash
B	I'll have another look at the um the invoice for the band
A	mm mm
B	Cos I haven't looked at it since we ordered
A	no
B	I don't know if it's got a er deadline on it
A	oh
A	no I thought it said pay on the day
B	well I can't remember
B	so I need to look at that
A	yeah
B	so it doesn't hit us all in one big whack
A	yeah
B	Cos it's quite a lot of money
A	yeah
B	if you do it every month you won't notice so much will you
A	no
B	yeah but coming out your bank account it's not gonna change it drastically overall
A	yeah
B	well cos then you can't
A	too many jobs to do really
B	I know cos once we start this
A	and what if we do go away?
B	exactly
A	yeah
B	Cos we're gonna have a new country and new culture new job trying to find a new house
A	yeah
B	we're not gonna have much time to think about this
A	that's why I wanted to go to
B	mm mm
A	even if it's not the perfect deal which I was going round trying to find the perfect perfect deal
B	mm
A	you know it's like a pound out or two pounds out
B	yeah
A	I was gonna do some digging
B	mm
A	er the wind's blowing the other way
B	this walk's quite deceiving isn't it cos it feels like we've walked a lot further than half way
A	weh have
B	we're not
A	yeah
B	and guess how long we've been going for
A	I don't know
B	no
A	what?
B	twenty-eight
A	oh
B	no this bit's a lot longer than you think
A	well it's not gonna take us twenty minutes is it?
B	well it's gonna take us fifteen minutes
A	mm
B	are we having a roast dinner today?
A	mm mm
B	yeah?
A	and batter puddings
B	oh really?
A	mm
B	ooh
A	apart from I don't
B	yeah
B	that's alright
A	broccoli
B	broccoli
A	it just keeps growing
B	yeah? thirty-nineteen
A	yeah
B	hm
A	and the
A	I don't really understand that
A	oh you know
B	has she?
A	yeah
A	I was like
B	yeah
A	Cos you won't be able to get off
B	well she will do I mean
A	and she went It's in a resort
B	oh yeah that's what she's dong cleaning is she?
A	um a hotel um I don't know hotel service
B	oh wow
A	I said that's beautiful
B	well that's beautiful
A	she said
B	but you are really really stuck
A	yeah but she doesn't like snorkelling
B	well has she been snorkelling?
A	no but she's been to the Red Sea and she never went snorkelling
B	yeah but I don't think you can say you don't like snorkelling unless you've been snorkelling
A	no she doesn't say she didn't like it
B	yeah
A	and you can see all the little fishies
B	she'd love it
B	yeah but those islands you've got  you've got  the main place which is um what is it ?
A	right
B	um that's just a horrible town apparently
A	yeah
B	and they just fly to all the different islands
A	yeah
B	so you'd be stuck on an island which is just a hotel basically
A	yeah
B	with I dunno I imagine it would get on your nerves after a while cos you're just gonna have a load of honeymooning couples
A	yep
B	or just extremely rich people
A	and how high is the Maldives because
B	it's about one metre above sea level
A	they've got that big wall
B	yeah they built this massive wall to protect it from the tsunamis
A	yeah but there's um there's another group of um islands
B	yeah
A	I don't know where they are er
B	there's only
A	islands?
B	I don't know
A	they're not by the Maldives I think but because they're only like one point two metres above sea level they've had to evacuate them all
B	yeah
A	Cos the sea's just been coming in making the islands smaller and smaller
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah I think the wall only
A	that's gonna happen
B	protects the the main bit as well
A	well that's gonna happen to the Maldives though if
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	yeah
A	in the sea
A	one point two metres
B	yeah it is a bit scary isn't it
A	are you sure it is?
B	yeah
A	it must be higher than this the other one
B	no it's
A	where are the  islands?
B	um well it sounds the same kind of place
A	maybe it's some of the Maldives then
B	yeah
A	mm
B	because they're
A	mm
B	so it's gonna be expensive
A	the main island would have lots of culture wouldn't it
B	I don't know
A	it's just the resort islands
B	I don't know cos I did look at it and I dunno
A	ah
B	mm
A	yeah
B	that's what I wouldn't like
A	and yeah if any thing happens there's a lot of people to evacuate isn't there
B	yeah
A	so er I dunno
B	yeah as long as you've got some money you'd be alright
A	yes but the holiday makers
B	well that's unlikely for that to happen
A	yeah
B	the main thing will just be feeling cut off
A	yeah
B	I know it sounds a bit funny being bored in somewhere like that but I think you would
A	oh I nearly walked down there
B	how much was it?
A	ah I don't know
B	has she got an interview or has she just applied to it?
A	she's just applied that's all
B	so she wants to get out then?
A	I think so
B	now she's had a taste
A	and she's had a taste of being abroad
B	yeah
A	yeah and I think  I think  she wants to
B	yeah
A	she can't just up and move because they won't go and find her another house in a different area without some sort of reason
B	yeah
A	so to up and move to another country where they it I mean if her job provides accommodation for her
B	yeah
A	that's a lot easier
B	yeah
A	I think
B	no it's easier for us as well
A	yeah it feels easier
B	it's silly
A	even though we've still got to do the house hunting and all of that
B	yeah
A	it still seems
B	well I dunno all the paperwork
A	mm mm
A	crazy isn't it
B	yeah
A	mm
B	that's going to start happening here
A	mm
B	where you know the most intelligent people are just gonna bugger off somewhere else
A	I dunno actually
B	yeah
A	but if the
B	well no I mean intelligence as in kind of um I dunno people who are I dunno innovative
A	yeah
B	the cutting edge of science
A	well a lot of the people who are coming out of uni or doing a masters or something can't actually find work because of all the You should do a voluntary year and not get paid before you start
B	hm
A	how tempting is that to go and work abroad
B	yeah
A	and get the money first
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	to do stuff like that
A	but when when they have brain draining and people go over and stud abroad or work abroad then it's more likely that they're gonna get experience now
B	yeah
A	rather than stay here
B	yeah
A	so those countries won't be losing
B	yeah
A	as many intelligent people
B	yeah
A	which is what they're supposed to do anyway
B	well they're supposed to but
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	although
A	well
