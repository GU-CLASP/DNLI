C	I thought you might wanna see the wedding pictures
A	oh definitely yeah
C	yeah
C	okay I talk about it all the time
A	just er
C	but erm
A	I missed it didn't I? ah it's so English out there
C	I was waiting to get a text from you
C	I bet he's pacing thinking where is she?
A	no I wasn't no I wasn't
C	yes
A	no I wasn't
C	yes you were
A	I was getting on with some stuff my stomach was turning I was thinking oh do I want food?
C	why what's wrong?
A	no nothing I just need the toilet
C	well go on then get going
C	ah let me see your Facebook page
A	er my Facebook?
C	well I've never really been on Facebook
C	well I've never
A	I mean there's not much to see really it's just my wall
C	oh my
A	he did the ice bucket challenge or something
A	not entirely sure why
C	is that the end of it?
A	yeah yeah yeah it's just really short
C	it's for erm a charity
A	some kind of charity or something isn't it?
C	yeah my sister
A	yeah brilliant
C	have you seen
A	no no no I haven't
C	oh my god
C	was up through the night with a temperature and hallucinating
A	oh no
C	so she's not sure if she can make it round
A	oh
C	yeah
A	I didn't think she was coming round anyway
C	well I spoke to her and she said she was gonna try cos
A	mm
C	the kids were erm she didn't know what was gonna
A	I'll tell her not to worry about it
C	yeah I said if you can cool if not
A	no of course
C	who's it for?
A	hallucinating? that sounds terrible
C	maybe I did it
A	so you're claiming
C	oh here we go
A	oh what it's for?
C	yeah
A	this is them doing it? god looks pretty build doesn't he? big old pecs on him
C	I don't know why she said fianc√© she's not engaged
A	no
A	strange
C	I know
C	must've been nerves
A	so you nominate a bunch of people
C	yeah
A	nominated me does that mean I have to do it or something?
C	oh did he nominate you?
A	yeah
C	oh yeah then you have to do it
A	he nominated his cousins
C	she just walks away
C	princess
A	so what the purpose of this? you're just raising money but why ice bucket challenge?
C	they're
A	does it have any relation to the actual illness itself?
C	no I I don't
C	I think it was you if you get nominated you have to do it and you
A	yeah
C	have to go online and and put towards the charity so it's I think it's just a way of getting it out there and it has like everybody is doing it all over like I was just I had them
A	is doing it
C	what? how long it's been going?
A	is it something? yeah yeah is it something just in the last couple of weeks or has it been going for months
C	oh god
A	yeah okay
C	erm so
A	that makes sense
C	yeah you if you're nominated you have to go you have to dominate and you have to do
A	there was another one for
C	er sorry
A	there was another one for breast cancer wasn't there? where like people were not wearing makeup or something
C	yeah
A	of herself
C	yeah
A	not wearing any makeup
C	yeah
A	mm
C	if I was online I did it but I'd do it but
A	my problem is I'm a little sceptical about charities so
C	okay
A	they make erm
C	but they have to if they er
C	er yeah
A	companies that are putting research into avoiding cancer
C	but they
A	yeah I know
C	it has to it has to er
A	mm
C	getting awareness out there which costs money
A	but they're massive industries I mean like
C	yeah I know
A	so
C	hang on one second
A	just just a little bit sceptical
C	just told
A	ah
C	you should stay with me cos I've got a high temperature
A	just tell her
C	oh she said or we'll we'll happily come to
A	yeah
C	can have the day there
A	no of course yeah
C	yeah I'll text her back
A	either or
C	right I need a cup of tea
A	tell her not to worry yes
C	yeah of course they would
A	I'm just sceptical about charities
C	but I I mean yeah but you
A	mm
C	and
A	I did quite
C	er educate and
A	yeah definitely
C	erm
A	I I don't make tea or coffee or
A	no idea
C	erm
A	I'll turn it on I know how to do that
C	you do?
A	yeah
C	wicked
A	not that it's the wrong button
C	woah
A	that nearly blew my head off
C	but I think sometimes there's these you know there's these charities whereby you know they're not legit and they're not doing what they
C	er said they do and then it makes all the the dodgy charities
A	yeah
C	I think the ones best known of course is going to be there's going to be more money in promotion and advertising
A	mm
C	but at the same time because they are so big you're more likely that your money's actually going into the correct place
A	yeah I mean to a certain degree but if you think what er
C	yeah to a
A	but
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	they don't need to spend thirty million pounds on
C	but then we're not in that business we don't know do we?
A	if I give a quid I'm giving them thirty-three pence of it just so they can do what they want basically
C	mm
A	mm
C	the money then does need to go back to keep that advertising going
A	yeah
C	but at the same time I get what you're saying because does that advertising campaigns need to carry on to that level?
A	yeah
C	when the awareness is already out there
A	we know about
C	but exactly but
A	yeah
C	they need to
A	yeah
C	that would be one big one for me
C	yeah
A	okay because you know
C	yeah
A	but it was kind of to me at the same time kind of sad that it's such a big thing for a woman not to wear makeup
C	did people donate? did people donate?
A	that it needs to be for charity well of course women cannot wear makeup
C	no no but did erm did people donate when they did the makeup?
A	yeah loads of people donated yeah
C	oh so it was both? right right okay
A	but I was just thinking that you know we don't need to be spending this kinda money on advertising for the charities
C	mm
A	telling them to exercise more to do these kinda things
C	mm
A	everyone to tell me I look great
A	but not really talk about how to avoid cancer it's just saying don't think about cancer but
C	some people would
A	no of course
C	and they'll be doing it for from a
A	it just seemed kinda shallow to me the whole thing
C	but a
A	mm
C	isn't actually going to bring the best awareness to the charity
A	no no of course
C	unfortunately sometimes things like that do bring the awareness there and then people look into it and
A	afterwards
C	and
A	I just got a bit annoyed on Facebook like
C	mm
A	I mean she's a bit of a she doesn't live the healthiest lifestyle she's quite big quite
A	she's got three children yeah I know
A	and everyone's going oh
C	oh really?
A	how brave you are for taking off your makeup and I'm thinking
C	no see I wouldn't even do it cos I er
A	and she's like I donated this money to charity I'm like hang on a minute you eat like you drink like three litres of Coke every day and eat chocolate coming out your ass and like you feed your kids this shit
C	your ass
A	every day you feed your kids the worst stuff but now you feel really good because you took your makeup off and paid twenty pounds to Cancer Research
C	but isn't there? er can't you isn't with every situation?
A	I can't voice that though I can't say that to people
C	mm
A	no of course and I'm I'll be that one
C	mm
A	I'm sure
A	I just don't trust charities
C	you know what
A	it's a business
C	it's in in this in this world now there are there are always companies and situations that are conning you
A	yeah
C	and unfortunately the good ones
C	get the brunt of that
A	yeah
C	you are
A	yeah
C	and I love that and I'm lazy I don't always do that
A	yeah
C	and I I love it I love listening
A	probably doesn't make her a happy person or easy to be around
C	it sometimes
A	no that'll defrost really quickly
C	oh right
C	erm I thought something like this brings on salmonella
A	erm
C	I don't know
A	defrosts it too quickly?
C	yeah well
A	how do you defrost it? just put it in the fridge?
C	I just leave it out
A	yeah
C	cupboard
A	mm
C	or in the fridge
A	what I know about bacteria is they require
C	how do we know when this is done?
A	erm it starts to whistle or something
C	it does? okay
A	maybe you have to put that down
A	do you have a cup and a teabag or?
C	I don't have a cup no I was hoping that you would have a cup
A	I think
A	you didn't bring one?
C	no I don't have a cup unfortunately
A	no?
C	perfect we'll have er
A	someone's birthday
A	all I know about bacteria is that they need time and the right temperature
C	mm
A	so if I left it in there for a while and then there'd be enough time for it to
A	if I do it really quickly and then
A	I'm quite safe with food so I don't think it's a problem
C	doesn't smell of anything
A	that's the only thing I've got for lunch
C	doesn't smell of anything at all
A	it's just salt
C	yeah
A	you don't need to add salt to your tea
A	no
C	I know he drank green tea
A	yeah
C	not a lot of guys drink green tea
A	when I have to
C	I wonder if there's a normal what's the difference?
A	I lived in a place that
C	here we go
A	there you go I think it's done
C	erm what's the difference?
A	I have
C	oh god you don't do you? what was the hot drink that you used to? was it hot chocolate? or hot blackcurrant?
A	no er maybe hot blackcurrant or something but I never liked that
C	that was it
A	I never like hot drink
A	cool
C	I'll be having a normal cup of tea I've had a herbal
A	yeah
C	I've had a
A	if I'm sick sometimes I'll have like honey and lemon and ginger but it's only if I'm sick
C	yeah I know
A	yeah I wouldn't normally defrost like this but I erm I haven't got anything for lunch
C	oh okay
A	I need something
C	I could've brought something round
A	no it's all good
C	yeah I know I felt so bad
A	ah don't be silly
C	I know well I thought that that's why I said well it wouldn't have made any sense anyway but we could've put the bike in the back
A	ah no worries
C	but I didn't even offer
A	I didn't even think about it so it wasn't a problem
C	at point today yeah
A	erm
C	have you got your cereal still
A	neither of us drink milk so
C	you don't have cereal anymore?
A	no god no
C	you used to love your cereal when you were young do you remember?
A	yeah I know that's why I was so unhealthy
A	really
C	that's why you were so unhealthy
A	I mean my parents allowed me to eat two bowls of sugar every day for my breakfast and things
C	oh
A	well you say I'm fine but I've already had about fifteen fillings so I don't
A	mm
C	during uni
A	I don't think
C	no? maybe a little bit? maybe the crisps and the chocolate brownie sweets and the alcohol?
A	I mean alcohol's not good for my teeth
C	no you
A	definitely
C	well that makes sense
A	because your teeth grow while you're a child
C	well yeah that makes sense doesn't it?
A	how if you were nutrient deficient when you were a child then you'll have weak teeth when you're older
C	mm
A	and then I come home and need five fillings and she's fine
C	what you what you
A	exactly the same thing
A	go back stop eating
C	time machine
A	gotta stop eating Weetos
C	back back to the back to the future
A	do you want any biscuits with this?
C	where are we sitting? no
A	good I don't know where they are
A	there's a apple
C	no
A	it's quite old
C	no but no no no no
A	there's a lemon
C	how is erm
A	god knows
C	yeah
A	so I have no idea
C	well it wasn't erm
A	yeah I was tempted to drop her an email the other day actually
C	well I don't know recently has it calmed down recently?
A	I was tempted to drop
C	yeah
A	say to her
C	yeah
A	but erm
C	they don't treat her like one or they just don't call her like one?
A	don't treat her like one or call her one
C	they don't call her one?
C	yeah
A	blood he's married in
C	it er it it that is a very similar situation
A	mm
A	it's no different
C	yeah yeah yeah no no no no yeah you're absolutely right yeah
C	erm
A	they'll've known mum since they were born obviously
C	do you think er er when er do you think your mum and my mum's erm situation was slightly different because they didn't really have a relationship with their own dads? they they knew that gramps would probably only be our the grandad that we would have?
A	I mean yeah maybe
C	I think I mean
A	mm
C	and things like this are being er are being are questioned and er and almost you know argued over
A	yeah
C	grandma grandad nan nanny
A	definitely
C	you know let them just do what they wanna do or or at the same er the
A	yeah
C	that
A	yeah
C	does it really matter?
A	so I don't know whether I should
C	you know?
A	say something to
C	because mm
A	just saying
C	I don't know
A	not particularly close
C	will it not be
A	well
C	however from
A	no of course
C	I have no idea
A	mm
C	so I'm just thinking is that the right step to?
A	but I thought maybe as
C	but you're not external
A	I mean I'm pretty damn external I don't see the girl
C	but you're not
A	I mean er
C	really
A	but I mean that's only
C	and you could even class me as not external
A	mm
C	as er sorry as as
A	mm
C	you are
A	yeah
C	because you're your mother's son
A	I guess I I
C	and she's upset about it?
A	mum?
C	mm
A	er I think maybe she hasn't vocalised it but I think probably deep down a little bit
C	yeah you know your mum
A	maybe
C	she used those words?
A	my mum said that
C	that
A	I don't know I really don't know the intricacies
C	oh right
A	no I have no idea what's
C	but but
A	she is like a grandmother to them
C	but
A	I'm pretty sure
C	I can I completely understand why it's upsetting
A	mm
C	there's always been an issue with
A	mm
C	but it only really it only it only really began when
A	yeah
C	it's like grow up you're a mother of three now come on
A	mm
C	well
A	mm
C	and to choose to be a parent
A	you
C	it's being immature
A	one would hope so but people have children with no training whatsoever so
C	yeah I know but don't get me started on that I know friends who can't have kids
C	and there's people out there who pop them left right and centre
A	yeah
C	and the
A	the wrong people are having children
C	I know
C	and then you've got people out there who would be absolutely fantastic parents like the people that we had around Saturday night
A	yeah
C	can't conceive gone through two IVFs
A	what about adoption?
C	erm
A	yeah
C	I'm not sure
A	yeah
C	and emotionally out of both of them as well that by the time they'd gone through that they were erm mm late
A	mm
C	so I think it's just do you know what? let's just relax for a second let's chill
A	mm
C	and they might not any get anything like with just they might not get anything out of it they might get really excited and think they've got somewhere and not
A	and then not get anywhere
C	they could be even older parents and then how would would they have the energy and?
A	mm
C	you know so they they became very comfortable with just actually going do you know what? I think we're okay with just ourselves
A	it's a fine line of
C	but they would be fantastic parents
A	it's a yeah it's a shame
C	do you are you not gonna have children then?
A	er I don't know
C	well no not at the minute
A	I feel like you need to be have
C	well and plus you're moving around so you need to have a
A	I mean for me it's different I'm doing other stuff as well
C	right
A	so I'm
C	but do you see them in your future? do you see them in your future though?
A	erm
C	that's alright
A	educated enough settled down enough to have children
C	yeah my my hit er my my er my mum did er late thirties
A	you know really early so that's a that's a concern really yeah
C	and it's hereditary it's hereditary
A	so that's a
C	er or it could be
A	that's a concern for us
A	we could
C	an eighteen-year-old to adopt
A	yeah
C	and then I'll pass them over to you at eighteen
A	I'll adopt it
C	here's your adoption
A	yeah definitely
C	we've always
A	yeah I
C	always
A	I think so yeah
C	mm
A	think so
C	funnily enough it came up Saturday night
A	mm
C	not ready for anybody else to come into that right now
A	no no
C	and er whether or not that feeling will the
A	no
C	but right now I'm
A	mm
C	I don't know what I want
A	mm
C	you know I think of us you know walking down
A	mm
C	something like that
A	no
C	and it's it's not changing it's actually it's becoming a stronger feeling
A	of not wanting to have children?
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	I feel it pretty strong though
C	do you?
A	yeah
C	you'd be okay with that?
A	life wouldn't never be that hard
C	mm
A	having children is what ties you to places is what makes life difficult is what makes everything a struggle and makes er this kind of stuff it adds
C	I guess it
A	I mean financially
C	it guess I guess it depends
A	I can't even keep a plant alive I don't know
C	I guess it depends on what you find a struggle
A	I have a one of the biggest problems for me is this idea that at the age of four I have to give my child up to the government and then they decide how my child is educated and how my child is brought up and what my child does with its days until the age of eighteen
C	so why are you going into the education system then if you feel strongly about it?
A	I feel strongly about every system
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A trusts all kinds of systems.	Contradiction
C	why are you?
A	so I mean
C	can I close this window
A	erm
C	you do?
A	and anyway I don't wanna be in public schools I wanna be teaching at universities which are different
A	erm
C	yeah but you're not gonna live in
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A prefers public school teaching.	Contradiction
A	where am I gonna be when I have a child?
C	unless something dramatically changes or you you feel that something's changed within you guys
A	mm
C	that you want to that's never been an option for you
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C wanted to close a window.	Entailment
A	I mean how old are you now? thirty-one?
C	yes
A	yeah
A	twenty-eight
C	I know you're twenty-eight
A	so I'm starting to think like okay well let's say I do want children
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and I'm sure they'll be successful and whatever but they don't fit in with the people that
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has two children.	Neutral
A	are around them so I don't wanna do that to my child so I need to find a country where I'm can be settled
C	yeah
A	I need to have got qualified enough and get a good enough job
C	it's not fair on the child either they're very er
C	they're very emotionally unstable children I think
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't care about the country he/she will eventually live.	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	that travel around all over the place and yes there are huge benefits absolutely huge but you find a lot of the time when you meet them they're
A	no I agree
C	yeah
A	before I met a girl before that travelled around a lot she was a compulsive liar
C	yeah cos she's trying to fit in probably
A	yeah I don't don't blame her
C	and
A	and she's
C	yeah I mean well you er you wouldn't even know whether you're coming or going that's horrible
A	no
C	right
A	we wanna be settled so
C	right
A	now when I start thinking about the timescale need to do a Master's need to do a PhD need to get a good enough job so it's paying for
C	so funny this is what I was doing at eighteen doing my we and
A	yeah
C	milestones
A	yeah
C	mm
A	and you just start adding that up and going hang on a minute I'm not gonna be thirty-five to forty before I'm ready to have a kid
C	I know I'm just like holy mother
A	so
C	well at least you are both on the same page
A	mm
C	you know and sometimes couples you know change
A	are you and
C	yeah we are
A	you definitely don't want children you mean?
C	yeah
A	mm
C	he would struggle with that for a little while
A	would your choice be easier if you knew that it wouldn't break his heart?
C	no my choice would just be my choice
A	you're still battling with whether you do or whether you don't?
C	my
A	mm
C	and we've chosen to erm commit to one another marry and spend the rest of our lives with one another er
A	but you have the ultimate say
C	er well yeah
A	the man really doesn't get much of a choice
C	well absolutely but it it affects you know yes you know I carry the child I deliver the child and he'll be off working and I'll be here during the day and all that sort of stuff but there's
A	oh no definitely
C	but the emphasis is more on the woman
A	I think it
C	because of you know they
A	it definitely affects us just as much but I'm what I'm saying is that you get the choice
C	er
A	if you wanna have a child then you'll have a child if you don't wanna have a child then you won't have a child
C	yeah cos no one can force me to
A	so it doesn't really matter what we think it's
C	no I er
A	we've gotta do our best to persuade you
C	I think it no but here's the thing
C	I think I here's the thing I think it depends on the person that you're with
A	mm
C	so
A	mm
C	so she would never do anything whereby you're not on the same page for something that strong
A	mm
C	that serious that big
A	no no of course
C	you know we're just lucky to be in that to be in that situation where you've grown up together and you've you know cos
A	mm
C	when you were at uni
A	mm
C	eighteen like
A	yeah
C	and it's hard to grow together and you go through all ups and downs but at the same time like you learn to just be a complete unit
A	mm
C	and what and and what you and
A	lived in a box
C	yeah lived in a box
C	of what you've done together it's cemented it
A	mm
C	you know?
A	well it has to doesn't it? otherwise you're
C	yeah
A	you'll you'll've been torn apart
C	yeah
A	I think you and
C	oh I think do you know what
C	I'm mm I I'm not being biased here but I
A	no I'd
C	oh you'd be such a good parent
A	oh on that note
C	you really would
A	getting a glass of water
A	I don't
C	oh
A	I know you would make an excellent mother but
C	thank you
C	you would
A	I don't know I'm not very good at hiding things that I resent
C	there isn't but er yeah but you never resent your child and
A	people say that but that's a fear
C	you
A	what if you turn around like I have a child and then it's four and I'm like man I really need to travel like really need to just change my life and I can't because of that child that I then learn to resent cos I just like end up hating them for like ten years
C	I do
C	I could've been off somewhere else and now I'm here with er with you
A	yeah I know I could've been doing something
C	erm but the thing is that because er by the time they're four you will've had four years to completely bond with that child
A	just need another ten years I think
C	I don't need ten years
A	to yourself
C	you need ten years
A	do you not need ten years?
C	no no no
A	no?
C	I don't need ten years
A	what about if you were as youthful when you turned forty as you were when you were thirty?
C	I'm still gonna be forty
A	yeah
A	but let's say you lived to a hundred rather than eighty or something
C	oh
A	oh she's on her way is she?
C	yeah
A	good stuff
C	erm
A	is she alone? is she with company?
C	she's coming alone
A	cool
C	yeah oh
A	oh don't be silly
C	hope you're okay
A	I'll see him when I see him
C	yeah
C	erm are you going to
A	oh no I'm sure I won't message her it was just a
C	a
A	I just wondered if I should I was gonna talk to
C	it might it it might be
A	mm
C	yeah that might be a good
A	I just don't think I'm ever gonna see her
C	it's not
A	grandmother something very simple I guess but
C	it's not but do you know what? I think you're doing the right thing by probably not
A	yeah
C	not sending anything
A	not do anything
C	I think you
A	and she comes in and gives you some advice about how to run your children
C	but you got but you got an email and said I don't really think it's appropriate you telling my father not to call your gran
A	I mean I was gonna be I was trying to be nice about it and say to her
C	of course you'd be nice about it
A	obviously
C	yeah
A	and your family but
C	but it's upsetting my mum
A	if it if it's not difficult for you
C	do you know what? I think I think that
A	should I ring up her father and get his er blessing first and then then give her a call?
C	no I think that any time you see her
A	which is never when am I gonna see her? I'm not gonna see her
C	if it's er
A	mm
C	it's quite calming and I think that the right setting er text phone
A	there's no context is there? so
C	no and people read it in different ways
A	yeah
C	so I think if you were gonna do that you'd have to find a way to see her and get her in an environment of where can I can I just have a chat for a second?
A	yeah
C	there's something on my mind I just wanna air something off with you
A	mum and
C	they don't see her? what about the kids?
A	cos she's got er well they they go there but they can't get her here because she has too many children now
C	yeah
A	so they don't have a big enough car to like actually travel anywhere so
C	I mean that's fair enough
A	I mean yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	I'm never gonna see the girl
C	you were there for the wedding?
A	yeah
C	no?
A	it was terrible no
C	why?
A	I just happened to be home
C	I didn't know anything about it
A	I happened to be home at the time
C	well
A	there's nothing there's nothing to know I mean it was a sugar fest they had like cakes and everything everywhere it was fine it was fine
C	cakes everywhere?
A	I haven't ever been to a fun wedding
C	oh my god my wedding was brilliant
A	yeah I bet it was I wanna see the photos you've gotta crack em out
C	yeah yeah I will do
A	I've only been to my mum's twice
C	twice?
A	yeah
C	were you?
A	I was dancing to Michael Jackson
C	oh my god
A	yeah
C	cos I would've been
A	which was
A	you know what I mean?
A	I mean bit weird if your mum's married to somebody else
A	no of course
C	you know by the book or
A	but I mean I was four when they got married
A	it's quite a while
A	no no of course
A	no
C	you know like my mum and dad were very
A	but
C	and they still continued that last week to put it through it's all stopped legal aid
A	I looked into grounds for divorce recently
C	you did? why?
A	just you know thought about maybe
A	well yeah it was just
A	you know what I mean? turns out the divorce costs about five times as much as the wedding
A	but erm
C	yeah cos I was thinking about marrying
A	I mean erm
C	er looked into a prenup but
A	yeah
C	I thought well there's no point in that
A	no I was genuinely
C	yeah
A	and it's only clicked with me now
C	yeah
A	I'm pretty sure my mum used that as a grounds for divorce
C	mm
A	on the government website
C	mm
A	one of them was if
C	I
A	in tears saying
C	no
A	that she's telling the family I'm an alcoholic
C	I remember I remember something that was brought up with with alcohol but it was it was very
A	mm
C	it was very much erm I felt like it was emphasised more at the end of their relationship as opposed to something that happened throughout
A	mm
C	that it was something that became more
A	when my dad went crazy?
C	evident well I don't know er
A	when he got drunk?
C	yes yes sorry yeah that it was
A	yeah
C	and I know you were there and that's that's terrible but
A	it was a function
C	mm
A	quite scary because
C	yeah
A	something from his youth came up
C	do you?
A	because he didn't know who we were
C	really?
A	he wasn't calling us by name
C	that's kinda scary
A	he was pretty drunk
C	yeah
A	something and my dad's a bit flirtatious but
C	yeah
A	I don't think he'd ever do anything
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is sure that he was drunk and that's why he wasn't calling their name	Entailment
C	yeah
A	he then I heard a scream
C	yeah
A	and my mum runs out says he's been strangling me he's been strangling me
C	you were fourteen fifteen
A	yeah I had to get my brother and my mum out the house and she's saying call gran your grandad or something
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person C is amazed at what Person A has said	Entailment
A	he he I never saw him lay a
C	mm
A	and if he did strangle my mother I've thought this in hindsight she bruises so easily and she didn't have a single mark nothing
C	what? so you don't believe her?
C	mm
A	pretty blatantly obvious even though
C	mm
A	and er they've got like a anniversary for thirty-seven years or something pinned on their
C	but they
A	yeah yeah yeah but she's got a poem saying
C	exactly
A	they drifted apart for twenty years and then they met again together and they really liked each other but the time wasn't right or something it's on this poem
C	mm
A	you know he strangled me it's terrible like whatever I don't know maybe my dad did just quickly grab her and she got away I don't know
C	yeah
A	but I know if he'd've strangled her she I she bruises when I flick her
[ANNOTATION]	Person A has doubt about her mothers story	Neutral
C	yeah
A	she she bruises really easily I know that for a fact
C	no
A	but he wasn't an alcoholic
A	no no of course
C	and you know people you will remember things that your mum won't and your dad won't
[ANNOTATION]	Person C said that you dont forget the things that happend to your parents	Neutral
A	yeah
C	because it's from your eyes and your perspective and your
A	no of course
C	and the only
A	memory's really really hard to trust
C	and you were the only er
[ANNOTATION]	Person C want to go swimming with Person A	Contradiction
A	that's why I'm not saying black and white
C	right
A	I'm saying yeah I'm not sure
C	and you were the only one they were the only people at that time in that room
A	yeah
C	and I would like to think that erm er
A	yeah and I'd like to think that my dad wouldn't strangle her and I'd
[ANNOTATION]	Person A like to think that her father was a good man	Entailment
C	right
A	like to think that my mum wouldn't lie about it
C	well I mean you'd like to think that your dad wouldn't strangle her and you'd like to think that your mum never had an affair and
A	I'm hoping that it was
C	all stuff like that but it's
A	I think my mum had been trying to get with
C	yeah
A	and I keep seeing they that's not the story they spun me when it first happened but I keep hearing things about their family
C	they're not gonna
C	I mean it's just
A	well she was telling me they just met you know coincidentally but actually what it turns out is
C	mm
A	but they won't tell us that they're keeping that secret from us
C	has it really riled you? has it really has it really upset you?
A	years before
C	mm
A	been had the childhood sweetheart that she kept bumping into and she kept fine I mean life is life I understand
C	mm
A	those things
C	mm
A	but if she's clearly put in as much time into that as you know she's been seeing him over the years
C	I'm sure my mum thought but I'm sure you know what
A	mm
C	I know she did she did not want me
A	mm
C	she didn't want us to know that it was with a woman
A	mm
C	she didn't want my dad to find out the way he did
A	mm
C	same same time for you
A	you don't think your mum could've waited a couple of years until they'd moved out?
C	yeah
A	yeah no of course
C	you know what I mean? it's like it's happened I can't change it
A	no of course
C	because in that moment unfortunately they're thinking of how it's affecting them
A	of course mm
C	but it's not at the detriment of their love for it's not because they not do you know what I mean?
A	no
C	oh my god do you know how many
A	no
C	I don't wanna do this if something happens with even with his parents which is very regular cos they his family's very calm
A	mm
C	erm and no drama whatsoever erm the
A	yeah
C	that that isn't gonna happen
A	definitely
C	and I I hope that we can learn from their mistakes
A	no of course
C	yeah I know
A	so young
C	I was we were very we were very
A	I don't know
C	just the age
A	like they're only twenty so
C	yeah
A	by the time they're forty
C	I know
A	they're probably gonna want people or want different things so and then the cycle just repeats again
C	but you've been with
A	yeah
C	but you throw a child in the mix it's er very different
A	mm
C	right
A	you haven't really got to know each other
C	but they've been together since for
A	they had been together for a while
C	for two or three years
A	yeah
C	but er to be fair two or three years when you're fifteen sixteen and seventeen it's just it's it's
A	you're not really going through that much together are you?
C	it's not even that you don't know who you are
A	once you start
C	I was
A	once you start moving jobs and moving houses together and stuff like that
C	I when I
A	mm
C	not being with him
A	they complete you
C	right but at the same time I said I er I can look back over my years with him and without him and think and I know one hundred percent that I didn't know who I was completely one hundred percent mindset I didn't know who I was really by the time I was twenty-eight
A	mm
C	like I knew what to say no to what I didn't wanna do what I did wanna do how to go about saying it
A	at like thirty? yeah
A	mm
C	about that age
A	mm
C	I wouldn't wanna do it
A	no
C	yeah I wouldn't wanna do it because you guys have been able to experience you
A	mm
C	you know
A	mm
C	you know we haven't
A	no it's er
C	well I think it's a little I think it's more boring than your path
A	not
C	you know what I mean? but it's just
A	mine's been pretty exciting but like
C	mm
A	most people you erm it's nor boring is it? it's it's the common life
C	it's not the common life
C	you've gone out you know I
A	mm
C	just like you don't know the ins and outs of mine
A	mm
C	I think it's great
A	well you still can
C	I can't
C	I've got a
A	yeah but you're young what about when you're like retirement age you could start doing it all then
C	I can't
A	do it
C	if we have children in the next year or two
A	you don't have to do things at the same time
C	no no and I wish I did some sort of travelling and we will do I mean we're going to Vegas in May so excited
A	mm
C	erm for two weeks that'll be amazing
A	I think you'll be the type of couple that come your later years you'll be pretty comfortable and you'll be able to go off and do these kind of things I think
C	I hope so
A	I mean I think you will be
C	I hope so but I hope that I've got the energy to
A	so if you
C	I hope that I've got the energy to
A	I'm sure you will
C	cos you'll still have the
A	you're pretty trim and
C	you'll still have the bug in you cos it's just in you
A	mm
C	that's who you are
C	you will
A	most people will probably have similar experiences come to the completion of their life maybe we just do things at different times
C	mm
A	I've had some pretty amazing experiences I could put it down and and focus on something else but
A	now my job is abroad so I live abroad anyway that's just part of my life and just need to do it
C	mm?
A	friends I have different relationships
C	like what?
A	with friends back home now and with
C	yeah
A	family and
C	yeah
A	just you know there's sacrifices from living abroad
C	it's
A	things that I miss things that I'm not here for I've missed your weddings I've missed these kind of things
C	it's harder to keep I think you have to try that much harder to keep that connection
A	mm
A	I don't know and then I start to think like my best friend
C	mm
A	and now I've been living away for six years so I've lived away for twice as long as I was really good friends with him
C	but you're not even going to the evening?
A	no he's it's only a really small affair I haven't got a problem with it
C	okay
A	it's like it's fine
C	but I've never visited you once
A	you probably wouldn't
C	okay
A	with friends to a certain degree
C	okay
A	we should be of the same kinda mind and the same ilk and like
C	okay
A	he's travelled with me before we travelled together so
C	okay
A	I thought he'd wanna travel more and keep doing those kinda things
C	okay
A	so I just guess I kind of feel if you're not gonna come and visit me and when I come home we're not close enough to do these kinda I guess I just his relationship with me just takes a step down a little bit
C	mm
A	and we're still close and I'll still see him when I see him but I'm not gonna expect him to come out and visit me I'm not gonna the it's just taken a step down and I've met other people that I've met when I've travelling that
C	mm
A	that these guys are just on a different level
C	yeah
A	to some of my friends back at home I can't really explain it
C	I don't know I think it's I think it maybe is a little bit unfair to say a different class of friends cos it's almost putting your
A	it is to a certain degree though
C	it kinda does sound harsh
A	it's it does sound harsh but like if I'm never gonna live in England
C	but isn't it just that you've you're different?
A	and these friends are never gonna leave England
C	mm
A	then what am I holding on to? I'm not gonna see them very much and I'm not gonna know them but if I've got friends that are gonna be wherever I'm gonna be and I'm gonna be wherever they're gonna be
C	but it's not
A	it is a different class of friend these are the friends that I'm meeting that if I live in Saudi they'll visit me
C	how okay one
A	yeah erm
C	mm
A	then I'm not gonna see them and I'm not gonna know them and it just it's it's difficult to talk about this
C	see I when you said class I thought you meant as in
A	well I no no no
C	I don't know that's why I was saying that's how it came across
A	I guess it's like these people in England are my best friends
C	mm
A	and I didn't think you could get any more than a best friend
C	mm
A	but now I've got a super-best friend
C	right
A	is the only way of describing it someone
C	okay
A	who not only you know
C	sorry that's how that's what I that's what I thought when you said it that's why I said well that's a bit harsh so
A	no no no
C	okay
A	no no no no
C	mm
A	I feel like if I said hey I'm having a wedding and it's gonna be in India
C	yeah
A	they'd make it
C	see now I
A	yeah
C	because there were certain people that didn't come out for our wedding
A	yeah
C	and there is split
A	no
C	we would go
A	yeah
C	that's it that's fine where are you
A	I guess that's what I mean by another class of friends
C	okay
A	these friends are in a different level
C	I'm with you
A	they do these things for me and I do those things for them
C	on the same page now
A	erm
C	but you but I think that's just life isn't it? you grow and you you you er meet people that are on the same page
A	mm
C	that you connect differently with
A	mm
C	you don't have that with your other friends
A	but it's a bit weird isn't it though? to be reminiscing about between fifteen
C	and it's and it's
A	because I only knew
C	yeah but didn't you have fun at that time? didn't you have fun?
A	so let's say
C	why is that sad? why can't you reminisce over those three years?
A	of course you can but if you've been doing it every year up until you're forty it's a bit why aren't you making new memories or
C	well I guess if
A	yeah but not with them I guess you just start to see friends in a different way as you get older
C	you do
A	and and living in a different country puts a whole other spin on it it really does put a whole other spin on friends
C	I
C	I bet it does because it's er you know it's different ways of life and different cultures everywhere you go
A	I've got friends
C	mm
A	I don't know what's going on in their lives they don't know what's going on in my life
C	at least he contacts you when you come back though and
A	yeah when I come home he does but they're like
C	mm
A	more than he needs mine he probably just feels like we're bros we're friends forever whatever
C	yeah
A	but I guess
C	so do you contact him?
A	I'm more like my mum I'm more
C	yeah
A	but I want my friends to contact me because I feel bad I'm the one that chose to live abroad
C	god don't feel guilty
A	but but er I guess just after years of that you start to think well maybe we're not that close any more maybe I don't need to stay in touch with these people
C	you know what it I I think I think er a little bit
A	yeah it is just life
C	out of sight out of mind sometimes when people don't people don't mean it in a
A	I guess it's just that you become completely comfortable with yourself at my kinda age I guess I'm learning that and just with certain friends
C	yeah and I I er and
A	as I said living abroad puts a different spin on it
C	mm
A	it's eight months later
C	when you think about it it's the same when er it
A	mm
C	where we haven't sat down and had a cup of tea since Christmas and
A	mm
C	spoke it's the same
A	no exactly
C	I might as well be abroad
A	so distance doesn't really matter sometimes
C	you getting a drink?
A	you don't feel guilty when you're just
C	yeah
A	but when you're abroad you don't you don't have that option and I can't just
C	does she? is that? is she er was her parents quite old when they had her then?
A	yeah
C	right
A	the youngest so her dad's like seventy now
C	wow
A	she's the main reason that we're at home
C	yeah
A	we had two options
C	oh
A	no just do it on that one
C	woah
A	option number one was do a Master's and come back to England see family see friends
C	yeah
A	do all that kind of stuff
C	yeah? what's a Delta?
A	Delta I've already got a CELTA which is this
C	okay
A	both qualifications would put me the next rank on a job so it doesn't matter which I get now
C	so hang on
A	a Master's? a Master's gives you simply a Master's
C	but it but what's
C	sorry
A	okay
C	okay
A	postgraduate qualification to to do
C	so a Master is here and a Delta is here?
A	erm on the
C	on paper?
A	National Qualification Framework they're the same
C	okay
A	they're both a level seven so like
C	but this is more known than
A	A levels A levels are level five
C	mm
A	degree is level six and Master's is level seven
C	mm
A	a Delta is a level seven same as Master's
C	yeah
A	but the Master's is better overall
C	what did you have to go through?
A	it made it really complicated by living abroad
C	mm
A	I mean just like you know you have to do referencing and stuff?
C	yeah
A	and you have to give your last bunch of years that you've lived in but I've lived in random countries and random places so that's complicates things
A	then they need bills from where I've been living
C	yeah
A	I don't pay bills
A	er I just had to send so much documentation at this point I got a bit stressed and I just thought
C	I bet
A	no I know

B	yeah but to do what you're doing
A	no I know
B	and never
A	mm
B	go back you've actually been able to do that
A	I've continually done it
B	yeah
A	no my friends think I'm loaded like people I meet when I'm travelling they're like you must be loaded to do what you're doing and actually the way we've done it
C	but actually I'm just doing it sensibly
C	to do what you wanna do
A	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C is a reasonable person.	Entailment
A	and save the money and then that money that I save will go on travelling
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	so we've kinda just lived frugally
A	yeah I'll I'll take a bottle under the coat you know all that kind of thing yeah I
B	yeah
C	exactly I'll buy a Coke
A	so
B	yeah
A	we still have fun and I feel like we've done everything
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A want to go on journeys.	Entailment
A	but we've just meant that for the last eight nine years we've just lived by what we need like rather than
B	but what you've gained in experience is just like that's just like there's no value to that
C	cold shower
A	mm
B	you know? it's like
A	but like
[ANNOTATION]	Experience is the most important value.	Neutral
C	er
B	cabin fever?
C	well yeah cabin fever but it just catching up with old friends it can be a little bit you know I've changed and
A	mm
C	it's not the same how it used to be
B	yeah
B	but I get that just living here like I find since I know it's not on your scale
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C still keeps in touch with many old friends.	Neutral
A	no
B	but since becoming a mum
A	yeah
B	the friends that I've you know grown up with it's almost like we done a little bit more of that
A	yeah
B	and I've become closer to the ones that I've sort of experienced and done other things with
A	definitely
B	becoming a mum
C	but it is the same it's it is the same
A	do you find
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is closer to people with whom share similar experiences.	Entailment
B	mm
A	you revert back? I don't know
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I feel like I'm being who I was a while ago
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's A character remains the same.	Contradiction
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	and I I don't like it
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	because I'm like I'm different now er but
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that she change a lot	Neutral
B	yeah you're not that person
C	there's certain friends that I catch up with and I and I all of a sudden turn into being twenty twenty-one again
A	but why am I
C	I'm like I have I have
B	yeah you have
A	yeah
B	you're still
A	it's a strange thing isn't it? yeah
B	just a very sort of I can just imagine you now sitting in a suit and I'd almost feel threatened by how much you know
B	and how you come across
B	and it's just like oh my gosh
C	intimidating
B	yeah because it's just I love listening I could sit and listen to you all day
B	yeah
A	so yeah
B	oh god yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said that he is ready to be there and listen to what he wants to say	Neutral
C	er speak for yourself

A	you see age in the people around you don't you? you come back and everyone looks
B	no thirty-five this year
C	you come do you come back and you're just like oh well
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think after a while when you back and see your friends you can see how they changed	Entailment

[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	three
C	and
B	three and a half
A	about three
B	yeah that's it
A	so
C	oh don't I'm the same
[ANNOTATION]	Person C  was followed by the guy was taken picture by him	Contradiction
B	mm
B	have you noticed that?
C	yeah
B	the ones that you sort of thought were super cool they've like aged like really badly
C	a hundred percent
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think that the one he thought was the coolest guy before gets very old	Entailment
B	or you just sort of think not the path you thought he would've taken
C	a hundred percent yeah you think oh my god the one yeah it's like
B	yeah
C	we don't look too bad
C	if you look at the ones who were really popular
B	yeah
A	look how
B	we're not bad are we? we are though
C	cheers to that
A	yeah
C	cheers to the good physique
A	cheers to that yeah
B	but that's the first thing I noticed when I saw you my god
C	not looking old
A	I'm wearing a particularly tight top
B	no but you can tell like you work out
A	I do about four or five hours of exercise a week if can
C	and what do you do?
A	I go to the gym
C	what do you do in the gym? okay
A	and then I try and run ten K twice a week if I can but it recently it's got too hot in Korea so I kinda stick with that in like spring and autumn rather than and then winter it gets a bit colder
C	so what cardio do you do if it's too
A	erm so we have P ninety X videos I don't know if you know
C	oh I've heard of that
A	so like I do the yoga video I do plyometrics which is a good
C	yeah
A	kind of workout on that I do core synergistics legs and back
C	that's hard
A	I don't like doing the videos too much I find them a bit boring but
C	yeah
A	do em more than that
C	there's a plyo class at at the gym that I go to and it's erm I mean I can't do it because of my knee
A	plyo's really tiring yeah my knees hurt when I do that
C	but
A	it's like jump training
C	I love circuit based training
A	and then I walk everywhere and I go hiking and sometimes I go hiking on the weekend and I bike around
C	yeah exactly then you bike
A	and when you go hiking you're doing like six hours of walking eight hours of walking so and I
B	jeez yeah
C	that's what they do in America don't they? they do a lot of the time they'll just you'll you'll see them just walking around
A	yeah
B	do you want a chair
A	yeah sit down
C	yeah I've just sat down for the last how long have I been here now?
A	I dunno I'll have a look
C	you shouldn't've told
A	no
C	there is no way you should've just told her that
C	you made a bad choice right there
A	no but I have to have her permission
C	no it's alright with me
A	yeah
C	you
B	no I'm alright I'm fine that's okay
C	watch now she'll be
B	freaked out for about fifteen seconds and now I'm okay
C	watch now she'll be pronouncing her Ts and Ss
B	yeah obviously
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's alright there's only one person that's gonna be listening to it
A	I need you to sign a consent form
B	don't yeah it's fine
A	I'm being paid by Cambridge University Press to record the British public for the next year I've got a year to do as many recordings as I can
C	yeah it's
B	what's? what's?
A	so every time I see you I'll be recording you
B	well do you know what? the funny thing is someone said to me when I was out I dunno shopping or whatever and she came from a different area and she said to me she goes oh I can tell you're from
A	that's one
B	I'd never known yeah apparently we do
A	that's one of the questions yeah you do mm
B	yeah
A	but
C	there's definitely a
A	a lot of people when they turn around
B	yeah
C	yeah but
A	but I asked my dad
C	go with a military vest on just in case as well
A	yeah I know but a lot of people like especially from around received pronunciation Queen's English area will often say I don't have an accent
C	mm
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah
A	but everyone has an accent
B	everyone's got one
C	you do yeah I guess
A	every single person has one
C	yeah
C	yeah
A	around
B	yeah you do sound
C	mm
B	sound very well spoken
A	well I have a tendency when I'm talking to friends to drop in a lot more swear words because
B	yeah
A	I guess it makes me feel not so posh in some way
B	yeah
C	what? you purposely do?
A	probably yeah I've noticed myself when I'm listening back
B	yeah but I think I do that with different network of friends different groups of friends
A	it's it's true
C	I pick up what other people say
A	yeah
C	I'm like a sponge when it comes to at work there's this girl that laughs and she goes
A	and then you do it
C	and I've heard myself doing it
A	yeah
C	that's disgusting
A	it's called convergence
C	and also there's this there's yeah there's this girl at work who
A	there's it's a sociolinguistic study into it
B	what? to feel accepted? to feel become?
A	to become attached to become connected yeah so you you don't consciously do it but you
C	I do it too much
B	yeah
A	and you're like I'm not taking the piss like
B	no you don't know you're doing it
C	no no sometimes I do it now I'm in the car and I'm like
A	it has a term
C	he er you know he says oh it's it's twenty pound I'm like it's twenty pound
A	yeah
C	like stop it oh my god it's terrible
A	but it's it's natural and we all do it and it's called accommodation
C	right okay
B	you don't wanna be associated with em at all
A	so yeah you don't wanna be associated with those people so it goes both ways
B	you could do a bit of both you could look like you've just stepped out of
C	I think
A	mm
B	you know hung out in
B	do you what I mean? and and and literally you know
C	you just did it then do you know what
B	I'm doing it
C	do you know what I mean?
B	I'm doing it
C	you don't usually say that
B	I'm doing it aren't I?
C	you don't usually say it that way
B	isn't it funny yeah but I mean it's because I'm talking about it
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah it's weird isn't it?
C	but I think you've always sounded how you sound
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	you don't sound any
B	you've never been one for slang or are you alright? or
C	you don't sound any different to me
A	no
B	mm not really
C	and it's probably the you know the the career that you're in and what your
A	I mean the fact that I teach English so I should pronounce my Ts cos when I come into my class and my students are like if I say wa'er or compu'er to them they're like they can't spell it
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	they need to know that there's a T in there so I'll like pronounce it
B	yeah
A	I did drama for a while which means er that I annunciate
A	yeah
A	I speak I mean I use a lot of Americanisms now I'm like
C	yeah I know ass
A	yeah
C	erm yeah you go ass
A	oh ass I'll say candy
C	and and er huh?
A	I say candy instead of chocolate for sweets mm
C	do you? no no that needs to go
A	yeah I
C	don't ever ever say candy
A	I can't remember if it's a couch or a sofa or a settee
C	it's a couch
A	couch
B	either couch or settee
A	not a sofa?
B	I don't
C	no not really settee
B	you can
C	do you?
A	yeah
C	no
A	okay
C	no no
A	it's just
C	we're not
C	you don't call chocolate or sweets candy okay?
A	no
C	this needs to go
A	that's gotta go
C	but you say arse and you also say er well you don't say arse you say ass and you also say erm vacation
A	vacation yeah I say movies instead of film
C	oh I haven't heard that either
B	no movies
C	let's watch a movie
A	mm
C	no I say film
B	no no we can say that
C	do you wanna watch a film?
B	film yeah
A	in parts of the world they say fil-m
C	fil-m
B	in where?
A	parts parts of the parts er sorry certain dialects of English
C	really?
A	there are some strange things
C	love the Irish accent
A	in English we can have the consonant cluster L M together
C	right
[ANNOTATION]	there are no dialects of english, everyone speaks it the same way	Contradiction
A	we can say ulm and that's fine
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	that works in our dialects but in other dialects it doesn't they need to put a vowel in between it
B	once you've done this though where would
A	erm the reason I'm doing
A	yeah
C	bloody hell
B	mm
A	the reason I'm doing linguistics and not teaching English is because I can
C	that'd be amazing
A	I don't really wanna do it because I can't travel very well on it or do anything else
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has been studying linguistics for two years	Neutral
A	elocution or something like that
C	could you do something international because of the languages? or do you cos the languages that you've that you know
A	mm
C	can you do something that's internationally based or would you erm need to have the qualification in languages?
A	do you mean to do with
C	like
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c is a student too	Neutral
A	I need to very very knowledgeable about the language that I'd be teaching that I'd be fixing
C	okay
A	I'm
A	I'm there with English because I've been studying English for so long and I've been getting into phonology and everything but I mean I guess I could in Spanish or something something of a similar language but once you start going into a tonal language or something like in
C	okay
A	Asia or
B	when you say phonology what is that?
A	phonology there's phonetics and phonology phonetics is the study of all language sounds and how we make the sounds
[ANNOTATION]	no languages in asia are tonal	Contradiction
C	mm
C	mm
A	they do the alveolar trill when they do a D we go D here but they go duh duh on the T so they'd say wa-der kinda like the American duh duh water
C	mm
A	it's a different D
B	so interesting
A	I I can write in a different alphabet
B	really?
A	pronounced how it looks
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has no knowledge of the phonetic alphabet	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	you know or how does a G H become an F sound when you have enough
B	but see I'm teaching they're teaching phonics to like
A	mm
B	so that's how they start them off in school now
A	I don't like that
B	really?
[ANNOTATION]	phonetics are taught in school	Entailment
A	are they teaching them like guh-o-guh and kuh-a-tuh
B	a-buh-kuh-duh-e-fuh
A	yeah I don't like that and I don't think it's gonna be
B	but I get it because when she's saying kuh-at you don't go erm C A T
A	no
B	because she's not gonna recognise that is she?
A	now if she says kuh-a-t
B	yeah
A	that's fine
B	yeah
A	but they don't they add another vowel they say kuh-a-tuh and now put that together and kuh-a-tuh is not a word
B	yeah
A	so if they teach it as just the sounds with no other vowel attached
B	but they try not to like erm
A	let's find k-a-t cat
B	what is it? like nuh they don't want you to go nuh they nn nn like
A	but my problem with that is and I wouldn't teach like that is because that's so basic and you can only teach a handful of words like that because most words in the English language don't follow those rules
C	can you bring your pictures up
A	yeah of course
C	I'm just thinking if I need to
A	I can tell you about this another day what was I showing you? Cambodia? when do you need to leave
C	bring it up yeah I'll sign it now
A	cool
B	god all your pictures
A	yeah I mean this is crazy
B	oh my gosh
A	North America I've only been to those two
B	how was Brazil?
A	Europe I've been to these countries
B	is Brazil how we see it? or is Brazil?
A	Brazil was awesome
C	yeah
A	I wasn't in Brazil for long I was only there for two weeks so I can't really comment
C	not long
A	and I was erm
C	that's a holiday for us
B	yeah
B	that would be us
A	I mean for me it's not very long
C	I know it's not long for you
B	yeah
C	you know
A	I went to a short small corner of Brazil I
C	have you been to Vegas?
A	no no god no
C	do you want to go?
A	yeah I'd go
C	I'll be there in May
A	yeah
B	is there anywhere is there anywhere that you'd like to go that you haven't been?
A	and see
C	seriously
B	oh you're serious?
A	that's rat
A	oh I've had some terrible stomachs
C	yeah because you don't er you know like you've probably trained your stomach to eat all different things
A	yeah no I have
C	but you couldn't eat everything when you were younger
B	yeah
A	no no I was terrible but
C	I know
A	I'm a lot better now
C	yeah
A	what am I looking for?
B	do you still think you're fussy with food? are you?

A	no
B	it's like
A	where would it be? poems and letters?
B	did you type this before?
A	yeah I memorised it so I said it before

C	I know
A	this ring is but a symbol of our love it probably doesn't fit neatly on your finger which it didn't it only fit on that one or that one
A	er so she can't wear it on that
B	oh
A	what am I gonna do like tie a piece of thing? they were born from the earth and they grew and they became strong and unique and like us they were wound together in this perfect shape and they became dependent on one another and they'll remain that way until their end
A	and everything in it
B	oh my god

A	but I mean in
B	yeah you are
A	we can't be any more married

B	mm
A	somebody that I've been with for ten years and I've done all this
B	yeah

B	but it's like
A	no

A	no
B	you know they've had a son they live together do everything but she goes we just don't don't need it
A	don't believe in marriage don't wanna get married
B	no

A	yeah just the curly hair and the kind of she looks cheeky she looks really cheeky
B	she
A	mm
B	she's got that sort of look about her
A	you've got a wonderful blend of culture going on in your all your family it's really good
B	yeah like well a lot of people are like quite intrigued cos they'll see sort of their
A	mm
B	and
A	yeah
B	but you know and then there's me who's mixed race and then when you when I hear when you say
A	mm
B	they start asking questions and whatever
A	mm
B	and yeah
A	yes
B	names that just stuck
A	they're both really nice names
B	but
B	but I never would've gone for a name
A	are you done?
B	yeah
A	any more?
B	no
A	no more?
B	yeah done
A	you got the perfect amount really didn't you? two one boy and one girl
B	mm
A	yeah
B	he would I think he feels like two's a cop out
B	it's lovely but he feels like three or four is family
A	he needs a big family
B	and I'm like and I'm actually come down to it but financially it's nice we can go on nice holidays
A	mm
B	we can do all our you know going out and doing stuff with them and now I'm at that point where
A	mm
B	so it's almost like
A	you need to get him to have a vasectomy or something
B	the thought of going back to
A	yeah
B	no cos if turn around tomorrow and said I'm pregnant he'd be over the moon so he is definitely not gonna go for one
A	so you've just gotta be really careful
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh no no I've taken all no that's never gonna happen
A	yeah
B	no no so I've made sure of that but erm
B	yeah
A	no
B	I mean I was quite shocked at the age gap I was gonna have
A	yeah
B	like are you mad like?
A	ready to pop this one out
B	I'm not
A	how difficult was pregnancy?
B	alright
A	mm
B	unfortunately though because of all what's happening with mum and dad I had a bit
A	it's a terrible time
B	stress
A	hang on a second someone's
B	yeah sure
A	oh it's just the next door neighbours that's alright
B	yeah
A	I don't know them
B	yeah
B	like unfortunately
A	mm
B	I was diagnosed with preeclampsia which I'm undiagnosed
A	what is that exactly?
B	so basically it's like they call it oedema so I had major swelling on my feet but when you're pregnant you always like puff out and swell out everywhere
A	yeah mum went really funny it was the the last one
B	yeah
A	yeah I was here and she was all really swollen and like
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but I had it well
A	yeah
B	erm and you get sort of extra protein in the urine and sort of backache erm you know things just symptoms that aren't quite right
A	mm
B	erm
A	oh man
B	and I think one day I was in so much pain
A	yeah
B	erm went into hospital and basically erm one of the women that my mum knows she was working in the hospital and she says oh can you get her to see one fo the consultants that you know? so I had one of the top consultants and I think within about forty-five minutes she said erm you've got very high-risk preeclampsia
A	oh my god
B	I can go into a brain haemorrhage and
A	pretty dangerous then yeah?
B	yeah all sorts it's like really bad
B	so basically you have to stop the process which unfortunately then brings on early labour
A	yeah
B	so a month early he came
A	but
B	so they had
A	yeah
B	straightforward
A	oh wow
A	that can't happen very often
B	and I had a natural birth which was like lovely
A	yeah
B	I did have pain relief I did have
A	yeah
B	an epidural
A	yeah
B	I I got
A	that's an injection in the spine
B	yeah and a lot of people are like oh I didn't want pethidine because that can pass to the baby and blah blah blah but you know the epidural only affected me
A	yeah
B	it was to help me and myself
A	mm
B	I'm not having pain relief I'm not having anything
B	I'm doing it au naturel
A	and then you start going through it
B	and the doctor looked at me and he was like okay but don't put pressure on yourself
A	we'll see
B	like you know you you know there's you know there we are in sort of modern day life now we have these things here to help I was like no no no I'm gonna be totally you know
A	yeah
B	so and it was great after that I just pretty much slept through it it was like very
A	wow ten centimetres
B	oh
A	I remember those old fifteen centimetre rulers so you're getting on like
B	ten centimetres mega
A	wow
B	and when you think
A	he was an elephant wasn't he? yeah he was a beast
B	no
A	I've got a friend that erm she had her first child good friend she says she keeps having she's had flashbacks to the labour
B	oh I
B	at the end of the day to have something so beautiful that lasts your whole life
A	yeah
B	you have to go through a bit of pain like do you know what I mean?
A	yeah
B	the way I see it
A	yeah
B	you know it's not like we stop
A	you forget pain pretty quick
B	you do it's like
A	yeah
B	it's one of those I
A	mm
B	so they rushed me into theatre and he so he was a caesarean
A	C-section yeah
B	erm so I really wanted natural but because I
A	mm
B	so they kept an eye on me and it was fine
A	yeah
B	you know
A	you
B	blah blah blah er we're done
A	yeah
B	and he was a bit upset but it took me a good year to really feel myself
A	yeah
B	again and then
A	yeah
B	I wasn't speaking to mum so for the first sort of six months of becoming a mother I didn't have a mum that I could turn to
A	yeah
B	so I felt I was relying on books oh god all these books I had and
B	you know and friends that had had babies that was pretty much what I was relying on
A	mm
B	and then it took me a good year to feel myself to feel back to normal
A	mm
B	and then it was like I never felt the sense of broodiness but I just sort of thought I knew that I didn't want
A	no it was time to have another
B	it's not it's not a
A	no yeah
B	so
A	you must be a very proud mummy
B	I am I am yeah I I'm I am loving it I am loving it but I'm one of these mums who worry about everything
A	yeah
B	am I doing enough reading? am I doing enough this? are they educated enough? are they stimulated enough?
A	but that's only gonna be a good thing
B	oh god yeah but it's a nightmare
A	yeah
B	to the point where it's like oh my god my friend's like you need to go counselling or something like you really
B	I'm always I've always been a worrier anyway haven't I?
A	yeah
B	I've always been one of those who worry about what people think and whatever so motherhood just takes you to another level I absolutely love it and embrace it
A	mm
B	but you know it's er I'm one of those that if you stand in a playground and hear a mum go oh my son's gone up to the next reading chapter and you're thinking okay why hasn't my son gone up to the next
B	and it's like
A	yeah
B	it's just so hard
A	yeah
B	it's really hard cos you just want the best but I think the way things are now I mean obviously I don't know you might say different but I feel like now it's like it's a race as to how quickly your children can do things
A	yeah
B	you know I've got a few friends who are like privately educated and it's like oh they speak fluent French at two and a half
A	which is ridiculous
B	and you know they they do this and they can do that and they're writing sentences at three and a half years old and you just
A	yeah
B	and it's almost like a race to how quickly your child can
A	this is one of the main problems I have with the education system really
B	mm
A	have got through it at the right level and be at the right speed and everyone learns everything together and
B	okay
A	and if you come out at school at sixteen or eighteen with a C you're gonna carry that for the rest of your life that's that's what you are you're a C grade student because clearly at eighteen you get that
B	oh my gosh
A	I don't agree with that at all I think
B	no because what you experience and
A	studying should be a lifelong process you should it shouldn't
B	yeah
A	be something that you do between this time and that time
B	I don't know anyone who completes Master's and university and feels well educated by the time they're eighteen because there's so much further education that you can still do
A	people learn
B	like doctors and lawyers and whatever else and teachers they're not fully experienced until like
A	I know it's easy to say yeah but don't worry about like
B	oh
A	if he's a little bit behind at this point or a little bit ahead at some other point er he will learn
A	yeah
B	you know she's doing things quite early
A	yeah
B	her I'm not as worried and she just seems to naturally you know pick up people are astonished that she was writing her name at like two and a half three
A	yeah
B	so she's doing things you know and I don't know if it's just a boy thing or what but
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah
B	because I literally should've been sitting my GCSEs and I was out already trying to learn how to do plumbing
A	school is one mould and we're not mouldable like everyone can't fit in that one shape
B	no
A	so they're
B	I know
A	that's why kids get put on Ritalin and all these stupid things because
B	god yeah
A	they're basically not fitting in with this one rule of how we all are
B	yeah
A	memorise things easily
B	it's character it's everything
A	other students
B	it's everything that contributes towards it you know
A	I was terrible at school
B	yeah
A	constantly bored constantly
B	and
B	so I've already I mean he's fine
A	is he six now?
B	yeah he's
B	and it's not like he's not I don't think he's ever gonna be top of his class
A	no
B	he's never gonna be in the bottom I think he's just
A	yeah
B	gonna be one of those
A	yeah
B	you've got the ones that obviously need the extra help and then I find the ones that are just on the average just tend to sort of get left
A	they get left out yeah
B	you know like when you go to I've looked we've looked into private schools they take no more than fifteen to sixteen per class
A	yeah
B	you know and there and there's like three or four teachers so every child is getting really like a lot of focus
A	ah they are
B	course it is
A	yeah
B	that's not school uniform that's not
A	and they're gonna come out different as well
B	course they can
A	no
B	a comprehensive school cos I just think then it's
A	they don't get on
B	they're they're yeah they are who they are and erm they're mingling with who they mingle with and however you wanna put it that it they're that is who they become you know so
A	yeah
B	I think one child I think yeah I I would do everything I can and I'd plug em in but
A	mm
B	you've gotta take on the whole social part of it as well
A	mm mm
B	you know you can't just turn up to a birthday party with a ten pound Toys R Us voucher
B	you've probably gotta show up with like you know
B	oh you're giving him horse riding lessons for a year or you know do you know what I mean? it's like that whole part and parcel
A	moving up to another class of people yeah
B	yeah
A	no
B	but we're looking at private tuition I mean it's it was really
A	mm
B	erm I'm more than happy to come to the house
A	okay
A	I think she mentioned she charged an hourly rate of twenty-five an hour but she says I'll do it for twelve so if he needs it
A	brilliant
B	you know? I think he's doing alright
A	mm
B	he's already got to where he needs to be and I don't want him to hit the next year and he feels overwhelmed and then he sort of just falls
A	yeah
B	back
A	I think
B	yeah
A	I reckon because
B	middle school
A	I think with prior to ten people school for me in my opinion at least from the experience I had you're kinda gonna learn those things anyway just
B	mm
A	by being alive it's just people learn them at kinda different
B	yeah
A	rates and
B	yeah
A	the school is merely facilitating it and also primarily looking after you
B	yeah
A	while your parents work
B	yeah
A	so I kinda think up until ten everyone should get to that I mean unless he's really struggling or something
B	but I don't want him to get to ten and then he's really like you know you also wanna pre-empt
A	no he needs to be keeping up he needs to be keeping up with everything for sure but I'm sure he will I'm sure he is
B	yeah
A	he's well behaved and stuff he's just like
B	yeah yeah he has the
A	must be weird to think about your child and like
B	he's easily
A	doesn't matter how much you input it really is up to the child isn't it? the type of personality they are
B	well this is it because everything I did with
A	yeah
B	so it was like you know every night it would be like reading but also you know making sure he was learning alphabet
A	mm
B	and words and numbers and so I was doing all of that and this was like when he was three months old because they say you know you start doing all the sounding and stuff early and we went
A	mm
B	oh we went to all
B	which was like this like you know and it was just it was learning all sounds and it was like little things like when he was
A	from left to right yeah
B	and and then you'd have to rotate and and then like turn the rattle around hide it behind your back and then do it again so you weren't changing it swapping sides in front and all these things that I was doing so I've done I've done it all like you know
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mum was like that with me I think she was a bit not quite the
B	yeah but and I think oh yeah and there's just so much now there's all sorts baby signing and oh there's just everything going on now it's like ridiculous baby yoga baby this baby massage it's just
A	big business
B	mega money course it is you know some of it
A	yeah
B	playing with his toys
A	does it himself
B	we're not gonna go and pay
A	yeah
B	for like
A	yeah
B	so much more
A	yeah
B	herbs spices everything
A	mm
B	pure and we spent a fortune on food and then you know no salt no sugar so you know whatever we were cooking sometimes you need an some
A	mm
B	no no no salt so I'd always cook separately or do a separate pan for when I added his and then with
A	no
B	and I was a lot more relaxed
A	yeah
B	and she's a lot more chilled
A	yeah
A	probably hid all that energy from you
B	mm
A	you know? mm
B	and I tried so hard not even when I was you know I've got such a sweet tooth even when I was pregnant I was just like eating loads of fruit and veg
A	mm
B	I didn't eat a lot of a chocolate and he is a chocolate monster
A	yeah
B	well cos I think he knew you were depriving yourself
A	yeah
B	there's only so much that you can do
A	you can do specially with all this advertising everywhere
B	it's ridiculous and I think that's where a lot of the pressure's come from
A	oh definitely
B	true
A	they haven't seen the things on TV
B	very true
A	and so I can see that happening if you don't have a I reckon most of the wants come from TV
B	it's true
A	so
B	I mean
A	no
B	if we want something
A	he's doing pretty good though
B	he's doing well but we're not like you know we still live in a three bed semi we're not living in some
A	no
B	huge you know we we live by our means
A	and you haven't been working for a while so
B	no and
A	long hours
B	they don't see that side of it but you know he tries to only now work up till Saturday afternoon so at least we've got family quality time but he does work
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	you got a lot of the Polish people and everyone coming over who will absolutely undermine him and come in
A	undercut it do it cheaper
B	yeah so it's competitive now he's really gotta fight for some of these jobs
A	yeah
B	so it's not as easy as it was
A	you're done
B	very happy
B	I'd like for her to start she says she says things like erm
A	she didn't sound too up for it to me today
B	yeah but she she she I think I think deep down she does
A	yeah
B	I think her and her and
A	mm
B	just like that's never gonna happen
A	correct amount mm
B	unless you're a millionaire or some sort of celebrity there's never gonna be you but the thing is you just you find it and you just get on with it like with anything you do
A	yeah
B	you just get you just get by
A	are you surprised that
B	yeah very
A	yeah
B	the thing is I was a bit
A	thought he was quite young
B	I was a bit erm er sort of surprised but not that you know
A	oh is that what happened?
B	mm
B	so it was almost like well
A	no that's it
B	you know her mum's chosen her fellas over her
A	yeah
B	children so she met a guy decided to swan off to America and live out there and left em all in hostals let em get on with it so from the age of fourteen
A	bloody hell
B	so you know she's got a lot of issues her dad does live in this country but pretty much doesn't want anything to do with her so you know I take on what she's had to deal with
A	mm
B	so she may be quite immature in some ways but I have to say she's an excellent mother very over the top cautious and protective I think because she's never had it herself so she's gone the other way with
A	mm
B	I know but then I'm just a bit
A	yeah
B	adorable but I'm gutted for my brother that you know he's now watching money and pennies and having to provide for a family at a young age when
A	yeah
B	he's not really experienced
A	before he had a a life himself
B	I don't know a lads' holiday or
A	yeah
B	saving for a mortgage or getting himself just something
A	yeah
B	you know
A	maybe if he doesn't have any more then when they're older you know
B	well the thing is what are they gonna do? have an only child like you know I think they'd like another child
A	yeah
B	but
A	mm
B	and secondly not for at least four years like you know he goes I have to find my feet
A	the problem is I just think when you marry that young statistics are against you aren't they? for it lasting
B	well it's like my
A	yeah
B	mum moved out at seventeen she met my dad when she was nineteen had me by twenty-one
A	yeah
B	they didn't have much behind em at all cos they were renting and you know so
A	they lasted for a good while
B	yeah they did and they had four kids but you know not that it's a bad thing because er you know and it's like even with my two
A	was that you or me?
B	yeah it's me I think ah but it's just probably stupid Facebook erm notifications but I can't be bothered to
B	yeah but erm
A	sounded like
B	I need to change it
A	oh
B	I'm terrible with technology
A	no I'm I'm awful too
B	oh no you're good I've seen what you've done on there and I don't even think
A	I've only just bought this I mean I know how to use basic technology but I don't like it I don't I
B	no
A	I try and avoid them
A	I have my laptop I use that
B	no you are good
A	what you up to today then?
B	today I think we're just gonna be at home he wants to do some baking and he's not well so I think it's just nice we're doing a lot we do a lot
A	I do want to do some baking together nice yeah that's good that's good
B	yeah he loves cooking
A	those type of skills that er my parents never taught me they're really quite you know core skills that they've just seem to have completely ignored
B	oh god I mean that's the only thing with my mum you know obviously mum I love her to bits but it's just sort of like I've had four children I know what I'm doing it's like okay that's fine but I'm sort of doing it this way mum is that alright?
A	yeah
B	sometimes that causes a bit of conflict
A	no definitely
B	you know like my kids have never had jar food nothing you know
A	no mm
B	I've always cooked from scratch and she's like oh you know one wouldn't hurt them and I'm like well you know this is how er don't get me wrong they have had a Mcdonald's and they have you know
A	yeah
B	they
A	but it's occasional not frequent
B	yeah I know it's not all the time
A	she's got bigger hasn't she I saw her the other day
B	mum's the biggest I think she's every been now
A	yeah I think she is actually
B	she erm was
A	the first thing she did when she saw
B	she does it all the time
A	terrible for children
B	but the thing is mine I have to say mine for two weeks were awful I mean I don't like fizzy drinks I'm a bit anti them
A	yeah
B	but she you know on holiday oh you know can I have a Coke? yeah okay we're on holiday
A	yeah
B	you can have your chocolate milkshake and yes you you're allowed some whipped cream on there because the waiter had shown him and
A	yeah
B	so I didn't wanna be like but now it's like I almost feel like I've gotta wean em back to
A	yeah
B	you know and I've got a sweet tooth so occasionally after dinner they're like well mummy you know what can we have and I'm like well
A	cos you're addicted to it
A	mm
B	and then every time I went to
A	no
B	and cottage pies and it was all like so
A	yeah
B	you know he's alright but his variation on vegetables is probably about five that I rotate
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's just er oh
A	I was bad when I was younger wasn't I? I didn't eat much
B	no
A	on the sweet tooth front do you do do you have honey at all?
B	mm
A	erm
B	erm
A	cos like raw honey a hundred percent raw honey with some plain yogurt I find really is great for a sweet tooth and
B	really?
A	the most research I've done into pure honey there are actually
B	is it the one that actually says pure honey?
A	well this is the problem
B	because you can go into Tesco's and see pure honey but is it really pure honey?
A	no
B	someone recommended me manuka honey for when you're
A	it's yeah manuka's really good for you
B	I've got manuka in the cupboard
A	oh that's really good
B	and I was erm
A	that's from New Zealand that's not cheap
B	no it was about I think it was about six seven pound for a a pot
B	is that raw honey? because
A	yeah
B	I use that someone says when you're run down or cold
A	mm
B	you try and have that with some
A	it's
B	oh
A	so like if you eat local honey cos the bees are collecting pollen from all the things so it can help with local allergies
B	oh my gosh
A	not stopping it so
B	so are you quite now not into sweet foods or?
A	erm I'm still an addict to sugar
B	mm
A	and like there always seems to be a birthday or something so there's
B	yeah
A	a cake being cooked or there's something going on
B	I'm a bit like that
A	Monday to Friday we don't have anything at all
B	see I'm terrible especially after doing an all-inclusive two-week holiday
A	yeah
B	I'm just like I almost find I'm having to
A	mm
B	good one that blends it and I just spent something ridiculous
A	yeah it just blends the lot
B	like sixty quid at Holland and Barrett
A	mm
B	spirulina spirulina powder
A	mm
B	what I do is I try and have one of those if I can
A	good stuff
B	I had one of those for lunch today
A	yeah
B	but the children are begging me for a spaghetti bolognese
A	yeah
B	even though it's pasta
A	yeah cos
B	well I always put that I mean I do I do carrots and onion and erm garlic I
A	yeah
B	tend to put in things like that
A	so you can get the veg in though that's
B	oh god yeah
A	just give em less pasta and have more sauce
B	yeah
A	so it's all good
B	but it's very hard cos
A	I try to be conscious I like pumpkin seeds and I love nuts and seeds
B	you got a headache? eat
B	right and we have this sort of so cos even being with
A	mm
B	it's like you know they're probably more like English Italian but they're very like food is like the centre of everything you know
A	yeah yeah
B	and it's lovely because you know every Sunday we still eat at his mum's and his and his brother and sister so it's like
A	every Sunday?
B	ten to thirteen of us at a table
A	mm
B	got a very close relationship with their cousins
A	that food yeah that we ate
B	ah yeah
B	I feel like am I the only one who's like thinking this is a bit odd yeah
A	I do try and yeah I probably eat too much fruit I probably eat more fruit than I should really
B	god I don't think that's I'd rather eat more fruit than I would er
A	yeah
B	yeah I guess there's the natural sugars isn't there? er so
A	yeah
B	my problem is though if I'm hungry erm I'd rather go for a rich tea biscuit than a
A	yeah
B	apple
A	yeah
B	a quick fix
A	you'll avoid the processed stuff if you can
B	mm
A	I'm pretty good on that front but as I say come the weekend and my friends come over and they've baked us some blondies or some cupcakes or something
B	what's a blondie?
A	like a brownie but with erm
B	oh is that an American thing then?
A	yeah I guess so
B	ah see I didn't know what a blondie was
A	no
B	oh
A	they're really good
B	mm
A	or like they'll come over with some muffins or something they've made and then I'm like whatever it's the weekend so
B	I do there's times where once I'm on it I'm on it and I can say no
A	mm
B	but er sometimes and especially from a woman's point of view if it's if I'm due on I just
A	mm
B	get this oh
B	yeah
A	just go for it
B	I don't
A	and I don't like yeah
B	I I do like I do like sparkling water
A	yeah
B	see I don't know if that's good or bad but I love
A	what about juice? do you give your children juice?
B	I do I buy the Innocent juice which is well er according to what you read it's meant to be like one of their five a day so if they do have juice I do the one that's
A	I've read quite a bit about juice that says juice is really bad that you
B	mm
A	shouldn't give them juice the the problem is okay you've got all the cheap juices which I'm sure you know they're just no good it's basically sugar water
B	mm
A	but even stuff that's like a hundred percent oranges or a hundred percent apples
B	still not?
A	the problem is that the high fructose content of an orange is negated by the fact that it's got high fibre high nutrient blah blah blah blah blah so when you eat one orange yes it's quite high in sugar but you're
B	mm
A	problem is when you have a glass of orange juice about yea big that's five oranges
B	no
A	so it's the juice of five oranges so you're getting all of the sugar from five oranges
B	yeah

A	no
B	you know?
A	erm I barely know

A	I barely know her family she's only been up once and I've only been to hers once can you believe that ten years we've been together and
B	god
A	we barely know each other's family at all
B	yeah
A	obviously I've heard a lot about them and they've heard a lot about me and
B	but through much what they yeah but for everything that you've done together they obviously know
A	yeah
B	do you know what I mean? yeah
A	I think for a while they were a bit like who's this guy that keeps whisking you off around the world so

A	yeah
B	yeah so there's a two year gap between em
A	six and four
B	yeah
A	that's a good age gap I'm sure
B	it is nice I have to say
A	yeah
B	if you're gonna do it I know it sounds silly keep em close
A	mm
B	cos I think when you get I've got so many friends who are like children are getting on for five or six and they're like really don't know if I wanna go back to the whole
A	no no
B	getting up in the middle of the night and changing nappies so I would do it
A	sounds awful

A	no of course not
B	and they've made me to become a mother's nothing like it
A	I was saying before though
B	yeah
A	but what if I turn around and I'm great having into having a child and then you know they're six and I'm going I need to get out of here I need to travel I need to do something
B	but this is how I feel with your mum and dad did they ever not it sounds awful they
A	mm
B	now you know their children are grown up
A	no
B	they could've gone somewhere and done anything
A	I think it was a terrible decision to have

B	I just I it's almost like they're trying to live their life as they want to but you know sorting out babysitting for
A	mm
B	like obviously
