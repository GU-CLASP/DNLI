A	eighteen pounds an hour of conversation like pro-rata
B	yeah sounds amazing
A	so if you send in like I dunno like I've got like one and a half hours so far
B	yeah
A	but that's like thirty quid if they do pay it
B	yeah that's a lot
A	and like so today cos like so the thought of being able to have all my social events for free

A	you should do it too
B	yeah definitely should

B	yeah do
A	it's like really erm I was like why is everyone not doing this?
B	yeah
A	and then it is quite annoying I mean it's quite it's very weird when you have to be like sorry er do you mind
A	it's so weird
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will receive a link.	Entailment
B	I guess well so you need it to be how good a quality a recording do they need it to be?
A	I don't think it needs to be brilliant
B	great
A	I mean they might just say no maybe it's not good enough but
A	I haven't lost anything
B	something like a pub where there's lots of noises
A	yeah
B	lots of like voices maybe it's harder to make out the
A	yeah
B	the
A	the
B	yeah
A	since then quite interesting
B	mm interesting oh I think I might have made an error in what I've ordered
[ANNOTATION]	Only recordings of high quality are accepted.	Contradiction
A	oh no
B	I ordered
A	the
B	yeah it will be good won't it?
A	it'll be so flavoursome
A	and like the rice will be all nice and like
B	okay
A	it'll be good though
B	okay let's do
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A mentioned pasta.	Contradiction
A	it's just that yeah I was I cos I was
A	converted I I was thinking about the noodles but then I was like actually
B	I was thinking about the noodles they'll be fine
A	oh I did get noodles
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A had some noodles.	Entailment
B	you did get noodles yeah
A	I did get noodles
B	yeah you did yeah that'll be fine
A	you can upgrade it to noodles
B	I was thinking about stopping and just try a normal tofu ramen
B	no it's good to take a risk
A	that's a distracting thought
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B wants to try some salmon sushi.	Contradiction
B	I have to take a risk
A	oh
B	I just forgot that that's not what I was getting
B	I already went for ramen once this week so I should
A	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah it was delicious
A	erm
B	it is delicious yeah
A	so what kind of manic work have you been?
B	er I had this big thing for the new
A	okay
B	er I wasn't feeling very well on Friday so I just I didn't really do anything
A	yeah
B	er which I
A	oh you had a quiet weekend didn't you?
B	yeah
A	I wanna do that this weekend
B	it was really good
A	I just want that so much
B	it was so good I just felt really run down and like erm you know and you just feel like
A	yeah
B	you're on the brink of ill like
A	yeah
B	you just wanna lie down but
A	yeah
B	so it was so good to just
A	yeah
B	have a really quiet weekend I went out for drinks on Friday night and then just like stayed in the house until Sunday like
A	oh my god
B	and it was it was so good got quite drunk on Friday night actually you know that thing when you're a bit coldy and you're like maybe I can kill it with booze?
A	yeah yeah
B	and then on the Saturday it was like mm
A	I don't know if I killed it
B	it was so nice just staying
A	yeah
B	in the house cos I didn't feel ill enough that I was like oh can't go anywhere
A	yeah
B	it was like this is a choice
A	yeah
B	it was really good
B	yeah
A	but like it's
B	that's nice
A	nice drawing so like
B	yeah
A	I was really excited about it like I actually every night this week I've not wanted to do the thing where I've had
B	me too
A	to go and do but like fuck you like I don't wanna go to this
B	I
A	faraway place
B	I've had that this week I mean I don't want to
A	yeah
B	so I'm really tired I just wanna
A	yeah
B	get into bed
A	yeah
B	already weary er yeah so I had that article to do and then it was sort of
A	yeah
B	so I did that and then
A	what was the article?
B	er it's about the government domestic counter terrorism policy
A	okay
B	but so it's really interesting it's just a bit it's quite
A	so is that the prevent?
B	prevent yeah
A	yeah
B	and making of policies so
A	yeah
B	this targets Muslims is not enough
A	yeah
B	for that is you have to make the case more for
A	yeah
B	making the case around like universal values and stuff
A	yeah
B	about why it's bad
A	about around universal values
B	so like freedom of speech
A	er yeah
B	erm I mean like it has a
A	yeah
B	but also and like governments the sort of ethics of a government like getting into
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	which is what they're doing quite specific
A	as as opposed making sort of a culture argument about
B	well I
A	protecting er
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	protecting
A	yeah
B	or the er
A	that is interesting it's interesting
B	yeah
A	to have to like look on it from a different
B	yeah it is interesting
A	different tack
B	I mean
A	yeah
B	and also because it's been written about on like quite a lot so
A	yeah
B	I thought it was a bit more interesting sort of like should a government be fighting ideas? which is what they've said they want to
A	yeah
B	like what is that what are the implications of that?
A	yeah
B	and are can are they any good at doing it? which they're not and erm
A	yeah
B	so that what
A	that's so interesting
B	like yeah it was just
A	yeah that's so that's like such a like that's such a like important question
B	yeah
A	like I think like because it's like it's so like that thing is like so historically specific
B	yeah
A	what the kind of like
B	yeah
A	and stuff like it's so and like you know like er like
B	yeah exactly
A	in
B	it's very similar
A	and it's just the same sort of like
B	it's exactly the same sort of thing and we've now got like a definition of extremism on
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's just being an extremist is prohibited which is kind of edging towards
A	yeah
B	criminalising people for opinions
A	did you see that thing when they came out and they were talking about like the what they've advised schools to keep track on?
B	yeah kids
A	like possible yeah
B	yeah that's what I was
A	okay
B	I did I spent a lot I talked to lots of teachers
A	yeah
B	and stuff yeah
A	okay
B	yeah they've got to erm
A	really?
B	like all public
A	it's so fucked up
B	all public yeah all public officials have to be like aware of signs of radicalisation
A	yeah
B	and obviously most of them are really bad at it cos they just
A	yeah
B	need to just erm
A	I mean I guess there is something quite like there is something quite specific cos it's like there was she was like like the
B	yeah
A	what other extremism?
B	yeah they say that
A	that happens it what is it?
B	far right far right extremism
A	yeah
B	or animal rights extremism
A	yeah
B	that's why but it's
A	but that that's just like it's so like
A	animal rights extremism what the fuck? like there's like there are no there are no kids in school who are like that like just like cos that
B	yeah
A	that's kind of like a like knowing
B	outdated
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's outdated
A	yeah and like the I guess far right but like but like that's just a kind of like balanced out
B	yeah
A	so much better than any but like I
B	it's interesting actually cos in other countries in Europe they've you oh shit I didn't put that in my article so much research I just couldn't put everything in
A	yeah
B	just reminded me but in other countries within
B	yeah in other countries
A	are those like the footnotes?
B	yeah
A	various footnotes
B	in other countries in Europe they have got really similar models but in they have more of a far right problem so it actually the public perception is better cos they're not seen as
A	yeah
B	targeting people for the colour of their skin they're seen as
A	yeah
B	like as genuinely sort of against
A	yeah
B	different types of extremism so it's still kind of regressive in a way cos it's like you can't have these views and it doesn't matter
A	yeah
B	if you're violent or not but it is seen as being a bit more equal
A	yeah
B	like say in Germany where there is quite a big far right movement
A	yeah
B	or
A	that is interesting
B	it's not we don't have quite the same scale of far right movement
A	yeah
B	but also it's not it's just not on the political agenda
A	yeah that's interesting
B	so it's kind of seen
A	yeah
B	mm yeah it was super interesting but I just had lots of other like bitty bits of work I had a thing to do with
A	yeah
A	yeah weren't they the ones who like were really vague and like?
B	yeah
A	what was what was the thing?
B	I can't remember exactly what it was
A	there was like something
B	but I
A	yeah
B	really vague and then I didn't run the piece and it's like
A	yeah
B	oh it's too late now
A	yeah and they were like
B	and the all of that
A	asking for they were really like asking you for photographs
B	yeah
A	photographs
B	yeah
A	like
unknown_female	vegetable with pasta
A	ah thanks so much
B	er can we have a bit
A	thanks do you have any erm er like chilli sauce and soya sauce?
unknown_female	soya sauce?
B	yeah and and chilli
A	and chilli?
unknown_female	yes
A	thank you
B	er yeah they were a nightmare so this woman that got in touch with me a couple of months ago saying do you wanna do some work for us? and she's just cos she's worked for the Guardian and stuff
A	yeah
B	so I was
A	yeah
B	tomorrow? I was like it's very unlikely
A	yeah
A	mm
B	but erm there were just a few things that
A	that's it it's like a nice
B	yeah it was really interesting as well
A	like a nice job to do
B	oh yeah it was great
A	but like
B	yeah it was great just that's what was a bit annoying about it is that the piece was really interesting and like the it was really fun working on it but then all the stuff
A	yeah
B	cos like the woman who I interviewed had just said basically you should never give someone like
A	yeah
B	what you wrote and they can just it's bad and they're biased and
A	yeah
B	people always wanna change random stuff she'd said very
A	through her marketing department?
B	er the college have
A	oh right right right
B	a marketing department so like it would have taken erm
A	crazy is it like an academy?
B	no it's a further education college
A	oh okay oh sorry yeah
B	erm so it would have taken so that she was able to
A	yeah
B	I personally think fine like maybe it's not good practice to do that but if it's a case of someone like losing their job
A	yeah
B	not up for that erm anyway then I told the woman at
A	are they like they're like what are they?
B	it's like fuck off
A	yeah it's so annoying I dunno who but they were like
B	yeah
A	had this moment where everyone was like
B	it's like if you know anything about journalist
A	the new media
B	yeah she was like er she made it sound as if I'd done some like horrible faux pas it wasn't like well done for achieving the ridiculously impossible task I set you just she was like I think it's a very weird implication that because she's done you a
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't do that I said
A	yeah
B	very you know she was very reasonable she very specifically wanted to check about people's immigration statuses
A	yeah
B	about her sort of employment employment issues and like if if you're not happy with that and she was very reasonable
A	that's
A	like it's like
B	yeah it was so
A	someone's bent erm the rules
A	and just been like
B	just like I've also probably been a journalist for longer than she has
A	yeah
B	so I know I'm I mean I think we're about the same age
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	also like she's not a reporter she's her background's in
A	yeah
B	and I always let people
A	do you? yeah
B	like lawyers and teachers just check and you make it clear you say I'm not gonna
A	yeah
B	or changes to make you sound better
A	but surely that should be in the code of ethics though like
B	yeah
A	that's also like that's like the only ethical
B	thank you thanks can I get a fork please? er
A	that is good
B	yeah it is good yeah I dunno it just was yeah she just yeah like jumped up the like
A	yeah
B	it was really annoying though
A	that is really annoying
B	yeah cos just that I'd obviously I haven't been like oh yeah sure like why will you just check the article for me and tell me
A	yeah
B	if there's anything you don't like and I'll change it you know I do on stuff like that like I see why it's not good to let people approve it cos they always wanna change random stuff but but
A	mm so is that a general rule? you never send it to
B	yeah you're not supposed to
A	that's crazy
B	you're really not supposed to at all cos people often just wanna stuff to make themselves sound better about
A	mm
B	I do though when it's erm
A	and the stuff you're covering
B	yeah
A	and it's so important
B	if it's about a legal issue or immigration status
A	yeah
B	or a safety
A	a safety thing as well like I guess the thing is like surely that's the premise
B	yeah
A	where they have a lot of people being involved in it in the first place
B	yeah
A	like if you're talking about something which like you know like threaten like your life or
B	yeah
A	your family's lives like
B	yeah
A	of course you wanna be able to
B	yeah definitely yeah if it's like safety or
A	yeah
B	legality then erm that you would but then you can just be very specific
A	yeah
B	and you can just be very clear
A	and you can say no if they kick off
B	yeah
A	like they're not changing it themselves like
B	no
B	no I think most people are quite reasonable if you say I mean people will often be like oh can you just change this wording of this? to make themselves sound better but
A	and you're like mm nah
B	you can just ignore that
B	but it's just like often people will wanna change something to make it like longer and I dunno like sort of more intelligent wording or whatever
A	yeah
B	but not how they originally said it
A	oh quotations?
B	yeah erm
A	I see yeah that must be like
B	it's a bit so that's why it's not good to do it but I
A	yeah
B	but
A	that's really annoying
B	yeah it was
A	she sounds annoying
B	also
A	yeah
B	but at half nine when I go in it's like maybe if I just check to see then someone can come we're there till twelve it's like yeah it's all fine I explain that to the guy
A	oh no
B	like if you knew that was happening
A	yeah
B	surely you would check your email at like ten but she just didn't check an email I heard from the woman at like
A	you're like you guys are incompetent
B	but like so
A	that sounds that sounds so that it's like
A	over
B	so it's just
A	compensation
B	which is ridiculous
A	it was like they're like can't like yeah
B	and then he went he did manage to go later in the day but he like had to go to like a different class like not the people I interviewed which was fine
A	mm
B	but just er
A	I think it's so interesting where look at like
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	to be like a proper journalist blah blah blah
B	yeah
A	I think it's so like when you talked about like the Guardian as well before the Guardian features people
B	oh yeah
A	and like that American guy coming in and being like
B	yeah
A	and he was so fascinating like the culture
B	oh yeah
A	of like publications behind the scenes
B	yeah yeah it is really interesting
A	yeah
B	it is really interesting yeah by so
A	that's er that's
B	yeah yeah he's there isn't he?
A	yeah I think so
B	he's on the he's making videos though I think
A	mm
B	he's not erm they do some really good stuff anyway it was really great
A	yeah
B	about all that stuff cos it made it stressful and I was like
A	yeah
A	yeah how much did? sorry that's
B	that's alright
A	like such a rude question
B	no it's not
A	but I'm really so interested in
B	no no not at all it was like two hundred pounds
A	mm
B	and I did it mostly in a day so it's quite good
A	that's really good
B	just under
A	yeah
B	hundred and eighty
A	that's good
B	so
A	that's really good it's like
B	but it was very stressful
A	yeah
B	but erm yeah it was good
A	like
B	yeah it's just a lot more stressful I mean the time pressure was
A	yeah is it something you wanna do more of like that kind of like
B	erm
A	instantaneous?
B	yeah I quite liked it it was quite nice
A	mm
B	to haven't I used to do more stuff like that and I just haven't even kind of like she I mean the woman was erm like oh the piece was so great do you wanna go for a coffee? erm like talk about doing more I was like
A	you're like no
A	did you say yes?
B	no
A	mm are you gonna go so are you gonna go?
B	I guess so
A	I mean it'll be so
B	er
B	yeah
A	maybe you'll be
B	maybe she was really stressed or something maybe just like under a lot of time pressure
A	mm
B	but I got
A	I reckon you might be really good friends with her I think that's gonna where be the way this story ends
A	you'll go I love her
B	yeah
A	I just like inhaled a bit of chilli
B	oh no
B	painful it's pretty good this chilli stuff erm
A	oh my god this is just
B	is it? oh good I'm really glad it was worth the mission
A	good I'm like I think I'm gonna go back to work and be fine
B	I think erm
A	I'm just gonna it was like so quiet in the office this morning like this guy who works erm he runs a recording studio downstairs
B	yeah
A	and he's really nice he's erm he's called
B	oh yeah?
A	erm and like I kept really hoping like like this
B	oh no
A	it was like you know and I was like cos you know you just like
B	you want some company
A	need someone just to like be there?
B	on erm
A	I'm
B	you have?
A	mm
B	are you going to
A	mm
B	mm yeah I do feel a bit bad for missing it but
A	no it's so fine
B	I just feel really yeah yeah it was a last minute thing
A	you've got like
B	yeah
A	so he was saying he was like yeah we've got
A	this all-encompassing royal we
B	yeah
A	and we were like oh and
B	no
A	anything to do with your?
B	it's so funny
A	we we have got
B	that's amazing
A	it was really funny
B	the party is actually kind of a dinner as well but I hadn't realised
A	ah
B	cos I thought maybe after the dinner I might go to
A	oh
B	I was like oh I shouldn't not go to that
B	yeah she won't notice anyway once she's in
A	yes
B	when you're like
A	I definitely I think it's really important yeah cos it's like I think
B	I just thought I was sort of like it was one of those things when she first changed it I was like oh she cancelled so much
A	and you went to see her last night so fine
B	yeah fine
A	have you been to her house yet?
B	no I really wanna go and see it
A	mm
B	yeah I really wanna go have to invite myself round
A	it's like very proper
B	is it? sounds really nice
A	it's very proper I realised though like
B	I'll go round for a visit
A	I just like I don't earn anywhere near enough money to own a proper house yet
B	yeah
A	all my contributions like slowly work their way back into my bedroom
A	it's like
B	really?
A	so these cushions are lovely what's wrong with these snazzy bangly cushions?
B	bubbles
B	that's funny
A	yeah it's funny but you have to have like
B	I guess you can build up
A	yeah
B	getting nice stuff slowly though
A	yeah
B	that's what people do isn't it?
A	yeah I guess like you kind of like slow build yeah I think it's like something about like new houses which is like very unforgiving
B	yeah
A	I think it also makes me like quite neurotic like I clean much more at
B	really?
A	like and you like cos when it like I think if looks a bit scruffy and there's shit everywhere
B	yeah
A	you like lose
B	the fact that that
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean that types of things happens when you move in somewhere as well doesn't it? even if it's not yours
A	yeah
B	like you just
A	yeah
B	yeah we just got a cleaner
A	mm
B	it's like the best thing ever
A	amazing
B	yeah
A	so relaxing
B	totally decadent but it's really great
A	yeah
B	came for her first time today and I was like everything's so clean it was so nice and I
A	yeah
B	then eventually was like okay let's just not
B	like what a stupid thing to argue about
A	yeah
A	yes cos in principle I'm quite like anti
B	so am I actually
A	cleaners I think like I I don't
B	the
A	like I don't like what
B	well
A	I don't like is that I don't like the idea of like a society
B	yeah
A	whereby some people like they would say it's almost like
B	yeah
A	capitalists
B	yeah I agree
A	sort of servant culture
B	yeah
A	and and that's why I find that's what I don't like about it but in an individual case by case basis
B	but but I actually don't even think
A	people need jobs and like
B	yeah but I totally agree like the argument like oh you're helping the London economy it's well actually it would be better for like sort the structural system if
A	yeah
B	specifically you didn't do
A	yeah
B	do that but
A	mm
B	I definitely agree and I actually don't really think it's necessary if you live in like a shared house and everyone cleans
A	yeah
B	I don't think it's necessary at all
A	I don't think like people's
B	but in our current situation like
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and so so
A	no you've just gotta like further stress of it
B	yeah and so I'm also
A	like
B	quite stressed and busy
A	yeah
B	I don't wanna spend my spare evenings
A	yeah
B	cleaning and then
A	yeah
B	getting angry with my boyfriend about it
A	yeah
A	no it's miles better to I mean that's so true
B	and I also
A	erm
B	yeah and on principle er
A	I think it's just like people
A	live too but like it's that they end up like some people's lives are too busy to clear up after like
B	yeah I
A	and that's what it is and like and that's and like
B	oh I don't think it yeah
A	and
B	I don't think you're genuinely too busy to clean up after yourself though it's a choice isn't it?
A	mm
B	so
A	yeah
B	but I don't think people should be under any illusions about that
A	mm no that's true
B	there's definitely a choice if I was like
A	yeah
B	like clean the kitchen sink and stuff like that
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah and that's
A	yeah
B	what's so nice there
A	yeah
B	it's really nice but yeah I think
A	I think yeah it is I think it's like if you like cos I guess the other argument is that if you know you see it in terms of like a hierarchy of jobs
B	yeah
A	and there's just somebody paying for stuff and like in Spain I think I had a big argument with
B	yeah
A	like being a hotelier or like working in like
B	yeah
A	like what we
B	or higher status
B	yeah
A	like and like and I guess cos their economy is so fucked but there's no like there's no kind of oh or the associations I guess that are attached to it over here
B	yeah that's interesting
A	but I think but I just like I strongly believe that some jobs are better than other jobs
B	yeah
A	and like
B	but I think also like some
A	yeah
B	I dunno I don't think there's anything wrong with people taking pride in the work they do or like
A	mm
B	but I also I
A	yeah
B	where people have like
A	I've thought about
B	loads of servants
A	yeah I think about this when you said about your
B	yeah
A	like in your
B	yeah cos it's ridiculous
A	yeah
B	but then at the same time they're really good I mean
A	employment
B	but like the structure is fucked like the the fact that it's such a service economy is I think that's really bad but then at the same time those are really good desirable jobs for people to have
A	yeah
B	so like but I don't think it's good cos they don't have any downtime they you know they're there
A	is that what is is? like a
B	well they get like a day normally no it's not a whole week they get like a day off a week normally but most of them will save it up and go for a
A	mm
B	long trip to spend with their
A	yeah
B	wife and kids or be in the village or whatever mm
A	and it is strange isn't it? it's like
B	they're really desirable jobs and stuff
A	yeah
B	and for me it's odd cos I'm like well what they have a really different conception of what life is
A	yeah
B	and of what and like so
A	and like where you get your meaning from I guess
A	yeah
B	erm but
A	mm
B	but erm there's also to not have servants if you have the money to would be a bad thing
A	yeah
B	because you could be providing jobs
A	it's seen as like
A	mm
B	morality like you're not
A	it's really interesting
B	yeah it's really interesting
A	it's like that kind of like
B	yeah well yeah
A	until and until they're all
B	oh it's really is I mean it's it's pretty fucked
A	cos if you yeah
B	but
A	but it's like the futility of like that I think that's what it like er just like well that stuff just highlights like
B	yeah
A	the futility of like individual actions
B	yeah
A	and the bullshit of like erm sort of consumer
B	yeah
A	democracy
B	yeah
A	like it's just such a fucking ruse
B	yeah
A	like it was so annoying like
B	yeah
A	like vote with your purse like
B	yeah
A	and like all that kind of like whether it's like they're trained staff or like but you can't change the world by
B	yeah
A	your individual
B	yeah
A	and like
B	yeah
A	like I'm not changing anything like by like
B	yeah
A	you know exactly the same amount of meat is
B	yeah
A	eat meat or erm
B	yeah
A	is yeah is
B	yeah it's
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah cos you know that that it's er it's quite a circular argument isn't it? the
A	yeah
B	cos it's true like
A	oh that's yeah
B	nothing changes whether you do or don't but then if no one
A	yeah
B	if everyone thinks like that then nothing ever happens it's quite a difficult what do you think? this is a completely different topic but kind of related like about about so you know how the like there's such a terrible housing crisis erm but I was talking to
A	yeah
A	it does help people get by
B	yeah what do you think what do you think about that in your interview? cos I don't
A	I just
B	I don't know what I think about it
A	oh sorry can I keep the? thank you
B	I don't know what I think about it
A	I think I I mean I think they'll like they they feed
B	cos
A	and I know
B	it's is that possibly harmful I was like
A	yeah
B	isn't it just inadequate? he was like well it it
A	I think it's cos it feeds the same kind of like house as commodity model
B	yeah
A	the money you just get really poor quality homes
B	yeah
A	and the money goes like the
B	yeah
A	it's like
B	yeah
A	like cos they're the money that they buy into it allows those developers to sell their houses at that price
B	yeah
A	like I just think it's like I yeah I'm
B	yeah that's interesting that makes sense
A	I just think it's like you know it's like
B	yeah I'm really struggling with it so much I think
A	yeah
B	obviously I think it's a completely useless I mean
A	yeah
B	like policy in structural terms it's
A	yeah
B	obviously shit and doesn't it's like sort of looking like they're doing something without doing anything to
A	yeah
B	tackle the actual problem it's like treating the symptom
A	yeah
B	and not the cause
A	like they just
B	but then I didn't know if it was like
A	the housing crisis
B	I guess that like the money going to or like
A	and the thing is until you until you increase the stock of houses all that means is that those homes then just go straight back into the
B	the market
A	as soon as they're sold off like you're back to where you've started
B	yeah
A	they're just lost in the melee
B	yeah
A	and sold on at full price erm yeah I think like the starter homes now as well that's like another one
B	what's that?
A	so it's like you have to the starter so it's like Cameron's new pledge so
B	yeah
A	so instead of affordable housing targets they're gonna be building starter homes so in London the average price will be four hundred and fifty thousand pounds
B	oh
A	for a starter home
B	and what are they?
A	and that's getting rid of the affordable homes
B	oh
A	so affordable homes like you could get a starter
B	yeah
A	so it was like
B	still
B	yeah
A	but it was lower than that
B	yeah
A	and like he's just wiped that and it's all now starter homes really
B	and what they? are the new builds?
A	they're new builds so it's going to be part of like new build erm and the criteria for a new build new development it'll be you have to put in X number of starter homes
B	okay and you buy them that way?
A	mm
B	or you buy them in shared
A	I don't think you buy them in shared I think you there's like special starter home mortgages that you get but erm
B	yeah
A	like there was
B	is to build more houses
A	is to build more houses
B	yeah
A	and like the way to like there are set like the like yeah I told you about like the green belt like so if like the one if you wanted to do it if you wanted to do
B	well just there's a lot of land is not being built on yeah yeah
A	you you've got
B	I've read about this before
A	build the green belt legislation tomorrow you would bottom out the
B	yeah
A	the market with new homes which would then be
B	yeah
A	affordable and the problem is that it's artificially scarce
B	so
B	so that has to happen so no one else
A	yeah
B	can get any fucking houses
A	yeah it's like it's so it's so intergenerational robbery it's really annoying
B	it's insane it's
B	something like the average house gained ten percent in value from like the beginning of twenty fifteen to the end
A	yeah
B	it's like that was bonkers
A	and it would be a problem for someone like
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and just got this obscene mortgage for this thing and like
B	yeah
A	it's not like not in terms of just compromise but like
B	yeah she's spent such a lot for a house
A	from social housing and it was like
B	yeah
A	put money back into it
B	yeah
A	she would be absolutely fucked if the housing market
B	yeah would actually
A	bottomed out cos like that because like if you're building new builds then a fifties flat in a ex-council estate is gonna like no one's gonna want that compared to I still would cos I think it's
B	yeah
A	like much nicer the majority of people wouldn't so like it would just be like not only would it like decrease in value but the places that people afford would also
B	yeah that's true
A	not be desirable at all
B	yeah
A	erm
B	it's hard isn't it?
A	but
B	yeah you do it slowly
A	but like that's what it should be working towards cos like the thing is that like the green belt is there like partly as like our stupid view like idealised view of the
B	yeah
A	English countryside and partly cos of this weird like well not weird but like a post war policy of needing to keep our cultural land
B	yeah
A	the the security and it's so outdated
B	yeah
A	like like so much of that land is unproductive
B	there's a real paranoia about erm that once we start building on it then we're just gonna be like a horrible big urban sprawl
A	yeah
B	like I dunno like Moscow or
A	we already are
B	thirty per thirty percent of the UK is built on or something?
A	mm nothing
B	yeah
A	absolutely nothing erm lots of that land is not very it's not like great land like protect like the national parks but everything else would be kind of fair game
B	yeah
A	you'd have to get planning permission so like
B	but surely you could just make restrictions on what you can build on
A	yeah
B	like you don't have to just be like okay we've lifted it like do what you want
A	mm
B	you can replace it with legislation in the in different
A	well like planning applications like so you have to
B	yeah
A	have a
B	yeah
A	and guidelines and
B	yeah
A	but it's really
B	it's really bad isn't it?
A	it's so bad like there was like in the erm like start of the nineteenth century no
B	yeah
A	start of
B	yeah
A	there as erm like a big movement down from like the industrial towns and Essex erm and people were just buying these plots of like ex-industrial land
B	yes
A	erm called like the plotlands and they were building these kind of like ramshackle huts almost like
B	yeah
A	traveller communities
B	yeah
A	and like they're really incredible like but it's like
B	yeah
A	like Jaywick is a legacy of it and like Shoreham-on-Sea was one of them
B	yeah
A	and that is pretty much what this that legislation was a response to
B	oh really?
A	it was like people in the city were like all these poor people are moving down and building these like
B	yeah
A	ramshackle huts but they are so beautiful and interesting
B	really?
A	they're almost a bit like allotments cos like everybody had like big gardens cos you'd have like you know if if you were like just coming down from like any really
B	yeah
A	you could buy a decent plot and like build whatever you wanted on it so just really
B	that sounds great
A	incredible historical moment of like
B	yeah
A	self build
B	amazing
A	like self-styled communities it's like properly anarchist
B	yeah
A	erm
B	sounds
A	but it was like it's only it's land like and that's the big thing and like people don't there's this really erm in the UK like no one that so there's like think of the Land Registry so if you
B	yeah
A	wanna find out who owns something you can email the Land
B	really?
A	like no map
B	that's so interesting
A	and there there's this guy called Kevin Cahill who wrote this book and he was like and so he like er the last time it was done it was like in eighteen fifty-two or something
B	really?
A	it was like the Land Registry map where they like
B	why not?
A	aggregates all the information because it's political and there's it's like once you start to put it together and you actually I mean there's like percentages and stuff but until
B	yeah
A	you start to see like the MOD owns this this family of aristocrats own this like like ex MPs
B	someone should do that
A	grandad owns it there's there's this guy Kevin Cahill who wrote this amazing book called Who Owns Britain?
B	oh yeah yeah I remember when that came out
A	and it's so brilliant
B	I remember
A	it's so and it's really radical and he's like
B	a lot a lot of the yeah we
A	yeah
B	a couple of years ago
A	yeah it was a few years ago
B	yeah
A	but it's like such a great book and this Land
B	that's amazing it's so interesting
A	yeah
B	yeah it's really it makes me really depressed it's so shit
A	yeah
B	like both on a sort of like wider principle level
A	yeah
B	but also really on a personal level like the idea of like I keep thinking about
A	yeah
B	buying a flat and how great it would be
A	yeah
B	to have a flat but then you're like where would I be able to have that?
A	yeah
A	yeah it's so true
B	I keep talking to people who are like oh yeah I've I saw one of my old colleagues the other day and she was saying another woman we used to work with who I used to work with who's quite senior and she and her husband were buying and they started off looking in like
A	yeah
B	and how long it takes and how expensive it is you think
A	well
B	yeah
A	she's like I wouldn't do it again
B	really? yeah that was full on wasn't it?
A	yeah
B	that was well the thing is to me is like even if you could buy something just the principle of like how much above the odds you pay for this stuff
A	it's crazy so crazy like yeah
B	the way this
A	it's like I think it's really
B	it feels yeah
A	yeah go on
B	no I was just gonna say it's
A	yeah
B	but it increasingly does like
A	that's so depressing
B	and when my friend went up last year and that and he got into a rented house was saying like I stay here for a long time cos
A	yeah
B	it's run er you know it's managed by a letting agency
A	yeah
B	I have no personal relationships with the landlord so the rent
A	yeah
B	is so expensive once it had gone up they've got no interest in like at least a a private landlord
A	yeah
B	who you know might have an interest in keeping the same people for
A	yeah
B	you know it's less hassle for them or whatever like those agents they just get the keys if you need them like these new people come in and they
A	yeah
B	cos they've got no interest in it and he goes like every year it just seems to be like more and more up you know
A	up up up yeah
B	what will it be in a few years? like what an average of a grand a month for rent or something?
A	yeah it's crazy
B	it's completely ridiculous
A	it's totally crazy but that's really interesting you saying that to me
B	yeah
A	cos I often like you get caught up in the like like like abstraction of it as an issue
B	yeah
A	but like when you put it like that that is that is really that is
B	yeah
A	what it is it's like you know
B	yeah
A	you might and the
B	yeah
A	one if we can all just go and move to Edinburgh
B	yeah
A	which is actually like
B	or anywhere
A	in the back of my mind like
B	yeah
A	a backup option like just fuck it like
B	move to Edinburgh
A	like or moving up
A	like mass move out
B	yeah
A	like I think there there would be
B	or anywhere else
A	just anywhere else
B	yeah
A	er so no it's not and then
B	yeah er I know this friend who once move up to Manchester they bought a house
A	oh yeah?
B	and it's like erm it's like a family home it's like a three bed they're a couple and it's like a three bed house with garden like amazing just done the kitchen living room and dining room it's like really really nice like beautiful house and it was like I can't remember how much or it was less than three hundred and fifty thousand
A	oh god
B	and it's in a really nice bit of Manchester
A	that is crazy isn't it?
B	yeah
B	to people buying like but like nice places like get
A	yeah
B	a council flats with two bedrooms
A	yeah yeah
B	for that
A	yeah it's crazy
A	it's really crazy but I do like the thing is like
B	well actually my brother's house he just bought in
A	yeah er sorry can we get the bill please?
B	yeah
A	thank you
B	so a two-bed maisonette in
A	yeah
B	so a really good location but like really tiny
A	yeah
B	and they bought a really nice three bed house in
A	really?
B	and he said it had the same market value as the
A	that is so crazy
B	isn't it? and it's like a nice big
A	it's it's like yeah I dunno like even like with those distances I just think
B	but anyway it is crazy
A	yeah London is like I think
B	no
A	but there might I just think you have to start thinking about it different like you have to think about like it's one of the things like it's like making you can invest in London being much more multimodal
B	yeah
A	so like at the moment in
B	yeah
A	since I lived there for work even if you live out in like
B	yeah
A	but like if you properly invested in like and I
B	yeah
A	like Stratford or the Olympic Park
B	yeah
A	was like a
B	yeah
A	and now it's like this
B	yeah
A	poor imagination for how to do it but the like if you can start like
B	doing that
A	distributing it
B	yeah it makes sense
A	and like creating like and you don't want like
A	endless sprawl
B	yeah
A	but like there's like sprawl already like in south London there is so much low density semi-detached housing
B	yeah
A	like if you just
B	yeah yeah
A	like
B	yeah
A	like if you were being imaginative about it or you'd relax planning permission so the developers could buy it and then
B	yeah
A	like you know you'd get these like
B	yeah
A	blocks within
B	yeah it could be better couldn't it?
A	we could be so much more imaginative but like
B	yeah
A	it's just interests
B	yeah
A	it's just it's like it's massively about interests
B	yeah it's really
A	and more so than anything there was this guy Peter ReId who used to be like the director of planning for the GLA and he he said and really started
unknown_female	half and half?
B	yeah thank you is that alright?
A	and he was like yeah perfect he was like it used to be about property
B	yeah
A	and that it used to be about like financial assets and now it's about property it's like
B	yeah
A	that's the seat of power
B	yeah that's really interesting it is isn't it? yeah it's just so erm
