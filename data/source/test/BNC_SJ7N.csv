D	them in water

C	oh yeah
D	it's trying to grow
C	nice what kind of curry are we having? do you know?
D	probably a Thai
C	oh cool
D	but er er that depends on erm I know it's gonna be a curry
C	cool what kind of Thai? just like a green? er
C	do you ever do a massaman? or?
D	no I've never cos er I I erm
D	no no
C	that's fair enough
D	oh
C	how was your day?
D	busy
C	yeah?
D	quick yeah it's gone reasonably quick
C	cool
D	did you did your mum ring you? or you or did you get through to her?
C	she messaged me she emailed me in the end
D	oh right
C	I wasn't gonna ring her cos she told me before that it costs to ring abroad
D	okay
C	so I'm not gonna do that
D	so
C	yeah she just messaged me
D	I didn't think there was it wasn't too much time had passed you know thinking there was an issue of like so they probably were tired when they got there and crashed out
C	yeah I just began to wonder when they left on Monday and it's now Thursday I just thought
D	yeah
C	you'd think they should be there
D	yeah
C	but they did leave late on Monday and travelled all day
D	I was gonna say if they got there in twenty hours they were lucky
C	yeah I looked it up and it was about twenty hours not long
D	mm
C	twenty-one from here
D	mm as I say it'd be quicker if you take the toll roads but you obviously you've gotta pay for that
C	mm I'm pretty sure
D	er no
C	unless he just meant seven to the border or something I don't know
D	no it's er it's er how you you couldn't drive up to the north of
C	no
D	if you think it takes five hours just to get down to Devon
C	mm
D	it's not in there
C	where is it?
D	could you pass me the black
C	she's shopping for for the curry?
D	no
C	just in general?
D	it's just a food shop probably
C	oh cool
D	she's obviously got herself down there
C	are we picking her up?
D	yes
C	cool is there space?
D	oh here he comes
D	can you check my bag's not in the back is it?
C	no I don't think so
D	yes it is a little bit nicer are you alright
A	alright
D	are you alright?
C	did you lock the back door?
A	yeah
C	do you wanna give it a double check?
A	it's definitely locked
D	especially with all these robbers around
C	yeah we've had a letter through the post
D	yeah I saw it on the side
C	yeah
D	yeah it's locked
C	cool
D	I take it the cats have been noshed?
A	yeah it's all good
D	you've got a new cat I hear
A	oh not new we've had it for like a year
D	oh you didn't tell me that
C	new for new for me
D	er you didn't tell me that
C	oh the one that got ran over came back to life and
D	you still got you got you got Stumpy the three-legged cat
D	the tripod or whatever it's called?
A	we've still got the tripod and the other one
A	and then er we've got a black long-haired cat
D	oh what? a Persian?
A	I don't know whether it's a Persian possibly
D	oh I mean I remember Tandy I don't know if
C	oh yeah like you said
A	yeah I do vaguely
C	looked just like
D	I
C	with a bit of brown on him though
D	I run poor old Tandy over just before we were going on holiday
C	yeah
C	that was terrible
D	I know it cost quite a lot
C	it cost quite a bit and then he turned out he had lung cancer didn't he? or something?
D	no
C	was that just to save money at that point?
D	no
C	cos obviously you'd spent a bomb on him
D	I'd spent a lot of money
C	but was he
D	no I think they just the vet decided the vet cos he was fitting
C	oh
D	seizures the vet thought it was the best course of action was to plus er they do get to be very expensive I mean Simba erm was was diabetic type 1
D	and er to keep him alive would've meant erm an injection every day plus a visit to the vets every three weeks and that would've cost an absolute fortune and would've tied you to the house because you it's one thing for you to do a favour for a friend or even a relative to say can you feed my cat? pop round? but can you feed my cat and give it an injection? and
C	and take it to the vet
D	and if you give it an overdose this is what you need to do to to counteract the overdose so er erm having to inject a cat that's not willing to be injected is it's not an easy thing
C	mm
D	so it was too much it was gonna cost about two hundred pound a month to keep him alive it was too much money
A	yeah
C	it's not worth it
D	well if you had a stupid amount of money and you had someone who could keep attending then you'd pay it but if you yeah because of the er the er affiliation but erm we didn't have the time you know to be constantly and you also he had he was hypoallergenic so he had to have a special diet he was eating human food really so it was a bit
D	you know I mean
C	I remember you serving up him up rice and fish or something
D	he he wasn't you know he er he er he
D	he wasn't young so erm if he was young you may've grinned and beared it a bit more
C	how often do you see
A	erm maybe an average of like once a month
C	not too often
D	that's quite often he came up and see you then?
A	yeah he was here today
D	is he still on a bike? or car?
A	a car
C	we went out to Nando's didn't we? but there was a bit of a problem
D	what?
A	yeah
A	someone had had er an accident or something there was an ambulance just outside
D	oh right
A	so they weren't letting anyone else in
C	no they wouldn't let us in
D	so you had to go to Mcdonald's or something? plan B?
A	no we went to some
C	grill place
D	mm
A	erm just down an alleyway round the back near the the museum behind the er well next to the er the
D	mm
C	next to the
D	when did er erm
A	oh a couple of years ago now
D	mm that's something you lads should put your mind to once you've got your universities behind you is get yourself a driving licence even if you don't drive it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it
A	yeah I suppose
D	it's good for jobs cos a lot of the jobs'll say can you drive?
C	yeah I might pass my test at some point but
D	I mean even er you know you could get er pass it abroad you you
C	I'm not gonna be a very good driver am I? if I never drive
D	well
C	yeah
D	for six months can't see you ever being longer than six months here
D	well apart from yeah apart from now
C	can you ever see me being here and being able to afford a car?
D	er well
D	that depends what job you get how much you're paid and how long you stick at it
C	so I mean it's possible but I'm not sure
D	cars aren't that expensive to run you can get a car er you don't have to spend lots and lots of money I mean I spent ten grand on this erm I could've got a cheaper car but my work said that I needed to have a car that was
C	no I mean once you start adding on you know road tax
D	yeah
C	and fuel and
D	oh yeah
C	if it breaks down
D	yeah
C	insurance
D	I mean I get a
C	that's cool
D	tax free up to erm ten thousand miles and then after that er this is per year then after that it drops to twenty-five P a mile
A	well I just didn't have the need
C	what did you do with the lessons?
A	well I I had a couple of lessons and I
D	yeah I gave him five hundred quid towards the thing and then he stopped
C	did he get that five hundred quid?
D	I don't know I guess he did
C	where's my five hundred quid just being handed around?
A	what five hundred quid?
D	for when you were when you were twenty-one I paid five hundred towards your driving
A	did you?
D	yeah remember?
A	oh right
D	your mum I think may have paid something I know I wrote you a cheque
C	what happened to that then?
D	well he didn't pass
A	I don't remember that cheque
D	no but you remember the lessons it was with Click I think Clickdrive or something I did take some kind of interest since I'd invested in it it was either two fifty or five hundred I think it might have been two fifty I paid with the promise of another two fifty if you carried on you didn't carry on so I didn't carry didn't carry on or I paid five hundred with the er an offer of another five hundred I can't remember how much driving
C	mm
D	er they were only about three pound a lesson when I was learning
C	not worth asking mum she claims that she paid my first year's tuition fees which is a load of crap
D	well in
C	she tried to change history and tell me that that's what happened last time I was home I said I don't think so
D	no no that's er no you don't know
C	yeah I said I definitely er
C	I said I think you bought me a laptop
D	yeah
C	but that was it
D	tuition fees that
C	no definitely
D	well
C	well I know she didn't I've got the forms saying that I was given the grant for it
D	yes
C	which it gets automatically paid into
D	yes
C	I don't see that money so
D	no
C	why would I have the fees? why would I owe the student loans for it if she paid it?
D	no no I dunno why she got that in her head erm did she accept your explanation?
C	no we got into a bit of an argument over it
C	she's pretty convinced she did and I'm completely convinced she didn't
D	oh no well I
C	yeah I think I got a laptop with that
D	but she didn't er
C	and I'm pretty sure she'd have asked you for half of it wouldn't she? I don't think she'd have just given me a grand or something she'd have said your dad'll pay
D	she would she would've treated you equally she wouldn't like have paid a year of your tuition and said to
C	I mean a year's tuition is a little different now than it
D	it's a lot of money
A	it was before
D	yes
C	and I'm sure
D	no no so no she wouldn't have paid cos like you said things like that well you
C	are you ready to play Battlestar then?
D	yes
A	that'll be cool
C	do you wanna help me set it up
A	yeah sure
C	are we playing it in the lounge?
D	er
C	it might be more comfortable
D	yes in the lounge
C	yeah
D	in the lounge
C	erm is it just the four of us?
D	no there'll just be the four of us
C	it takes a good few hours to play
D	oh yeah
C	so we probably want
D	well we'll play up to a certain time and then whoever's in front wins are you with me?
C	game doesn't quite work like that but we can cut it earlier
D	well you can continue it on the Monday or whatever
C	yeah
D	er we'll just put it aside and
C	we'll have to leave it all set up
D	yeah it's not a big board is it? so it's not like it's huge
C	not particularly large there's quite a few pieces on it
D	yeah
C	but I think we could remember roughly
D	yeah I mean
C	but provided we just start it pretty soon after dinner we should get it done
D	yeah
C	if we play from like seven till ten or something
D	I'll crack on and start cooking dinner erm as soon as we get back and we've cleared the shopping up and I've got changed
C	yeah
D	what you should do is er you set the game up so that it's ready for after you know cos obviously after tea we've gotta do the washing up and stuff like that
C	yeah will do
D	then after all that we can we'll make a start
C	I reckon we can
D	no not
C	don't think? two and a half hours?
D	unless there's a lot of
C	well I said
C	no that's what I meant start at seven
D	oh right
C	I'm sure we can eat and cook
D	oh you mean done by I thought you meant the game's over by seven
C	no no no done cooking done eating
D	oh yeah yeah yeah sure no I thought you meant
C	game'll take three hours and with you newbs I'm pretty sure even longer
D	did you manage to avoid er getting into an argument while she was back?
C	me?
D	yeah
C	I did
D	what? you're supposed to be her best friend
A	I know
D	what were you arguing about? not the rent again?
C	thought I was the good child
D	what the hell were you arguing about now?
A	oh it's nothing important
D	just the tuition fees why is it you paid
A	no
D	and you're and you're not paying my
C	have you had any more er?
D	oh you don't love me as much
C	I didn't even know you had that conversation with her
C	which one? about you?
A	no
C	or with mum?
A	they had a conversation about me
C	oh she told me that erm she was a bit upset from your conversation the other day
A	oh yeah yeah no I meant you er your conversation with her about tuition
C	oh right that was last time I was home she was trying to convince me that she paid my first year's tuitions fees
A	what?
C	and I was trying to convince her no you didn't
D	no with the greatest respect
C	she couldn't prove that she did
D	well no
C	and I could prove that she didn't
D	she yes yeah
A	I mean she could've given you
C	yeah I don't think she did
C	regardless
D	but you would er
C	the the whole reason that I took a year off
D	yeah
C	before uni was to save up
D	yes yes
C	if mum would've
D	yes
C	I deferred I didn't
D	yes
C	I didn't apply at the end of my year off
D	no
C	I'd already got into university the year before I deferred
D	yes another way
C	I only didn't go cos I didn't have enough money if mum would've turned around and said I'll pay for your
D	yes
C	your first year I would've gone
D	er another way that you would know that
C	mm
D	it would've been a cheque and you'd have er a proof of that in your account
C	anyway it doesn't matter it was just something that we er
D	well it does to
A	never mind I'm not greedy
D	right who's going? I'm going
C	I don't think mum's got the money
D	probably hasn't I know I haven't got the money any more
C	definitely hasn't
D	cos er we've lost
D	well yeah we'll have to all be tapping him up for a loan
C	definitely
D	cos erm
C	god
D	and erm
C	pension will be five hundred pound a year?
D	yeah and er sick pay erm er her sick pay and her pension comes a distant to
C	why is her pension so low?
D	er because A she hasn't been in it that much and it's not that that good a pension erm
C	is this a private pension?
D	er well no it's er it's a company pension
C	what's her like state pension?
D	sorry? that's the state she's got she's gonna get about five hundred pounds a year
C	that's how much the state thinks you need to live on?
D	yeah although although she'll well there's two other small pensions cos the she wasn't a final salary which is a good one this is the one I'm
C	is it worth paying National Insurance for a pension? cos I'm like a few years out they're telling me that I owe them
D	yeah well er you
C	years of National Insurance and I have to pay thirty years to be able to claim
D	yes you need about thirty years to qualify which means the retirement for you isn't gonna be until you're about seventy anyway
C	so is it worth paying in? or is it just worth
D	well
C	making my own pension
D	well
C	and saving my own money and just ignore paying into National Insurance?
D	this all depends if you're going to live in the UK you're going to get a job and you're gonna pay National Insurance if you like it or not
C	regardless
D	but if you're living abroad and you're not intending to come back here then you will won't be entitled to a pension if I move abroad my pension will go abroad to wherever I am cos I've earned it I'm I'm more I'm paid up because er I I've kicked in if you don't contribute then you won't get a pension you won't be entitled
C	but I mean five hundred pound a year doesn't really seem worth it
D	no er but that's not her state pension that's her private pension
C	that's what I was asking you I said er was it a private pension or was it a state pension
D	no oh it's the oh sorry it's the private pension not the state
C	how much should she get from the state?
D	the state will be something like about a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty pound a week
C	not too bad
D	no on top of your private pension erm like I said your mum should be okay erm
C	no it seems a bit like a con to me
D	cos
C	just gonna get older and older before we can even have one and then you probably end up living for about four years on your pension and then you die so you claim out about twenty grand out of the hundred and twenty grand that you put in
D	well the er the reason they're putting er the argument I don't necessarily believe it is that people will live longer
C	don't seem to be people seem to be dying left right and centre
D	er no well they no they don't they don't seem to be at all erm the the er the one at least one in every three people born now will live till above er over a hundred that I don't
C	that's absolute bullshit
D	that I don't believe at all
C	I haven't believe it either to say
D	no
C	something like the you know the er average person lives to eighty years and then you think well what about all the people that die before they even get to sixty?
D	yes
C	so are they just not counted in this statistic?
D	well
C	is this statistic just the the average person that lives beyond sixty
D	yeah
C	gets to eighty?
D	if you look at if the if the it used to be
C	I don't believe it either
D	was your er your life that's seventy
C	well it's in their favour to tell us that so that we keep paying into it
D	well
C	cos there's all this massive dependent
D	there is the the problem is is that I don't think people will live the length that they're talking but a lot the within about fifteen years the
C	pensions
D	you need one
D	so there's no point I might as well have the three hundred and thirty-three pounds now so I did but once you start kicking into a pension and you get to a certain age you start thinking the wisdom of having one I can't congratulate myself erm for er having one because I had no choice if when I'd started the work er with the local authority at twenty-eight if they'd have said to me we can you can have a pension or we'll or er and we won't take six percent of your salary or we take six percent of your salary and you'll have a pension I'd've said I'll er keep the six percent and that would've been a a bad move
C	yeah
D	cos now it
C	but what's annoying for me is that I've been paying it in for the last four or five years and I've paid in about five thousand pounds and it's just disappeared
D	mm but not but not not to this not to this erm society
C	not to anything it's just gone
D	yeah
C	it's just been eaten
D	to Koreans you might have a Korean pension cos all you've gotta do is turn up for er you know
C	I er did I not tell you how the pensions work over there?
D	probably bad there I should imagine
C	every so there's only about five six different nations that work as teachers in Korea you have to be from
D	yeah
C	native English-speaking country England is the only one that has to pay into the pension but doesn't get it back
D	oh right
C	every other country pays in gets it doubled and then when they leave they get it back
D	right so
C	so they owe me about six thousand pounds and they owe
D	yes
C	because of their pension
D	mm
C	South Africans don't have to pay in but they don't they can't claim it back but they don't have to pay in
D	right
C	so they're exempt but I've been paying in every month
D	yes
C	for the four years that I've worked there
D	well er that that seems
C	it's been doubled and I don't get it
D	that seems that seems wrong
C	it's only British people that's it that's the only people
D	if you contribute by
C	it's a reciprocal law apparently we don't do the same to Koreans that come and work in England
D	right
C	we don't let them get a refund on what they pay into National Insurance but it's pointless
D	right well if it's an
C	but it's bullshit though
D	yeah but the law isn't always right
C	it's a lot of money I could really do with an extra six thousand pounds
D	yes er yes it is yeah of course
D	yeah
C	and withdrawing about twelve grand in between us
D	yes
C	it's just annoying that I've paying into pension that money's gone
D	yes
C	and yet British you know National Insurance are contacting me
D	yes
C	and asking for pension here
D	well you er
C	er yeah I mean they told me it's voluntary I don't have to pay it but I guess I'm just at the point now where I'm like should I pay it?
D	yeah erm this will focus your mind that you know if you stay here you either have will have to contribute for thirty years to get something or you don't factor in that pension and you get a pension by another way by buying a house and then buying a second house that you will then rent out as your source of income
C	mm
D	there's always means and ways as I said private pension I wouldn't apart company ones now are like private pensions and you can opt out but I would imagine if you opt out you won't get any more than the state pension further down the road if er cos they give you pension credit now er which I think is what's? that's a bit absurd er people are paying into a pension and people who aren't paying in are getting pension credit but I would imagine that that'll come to a
C	didn't take it do you have anything to comment
A	erm I'm a bit young to start thinking about it but I suppose I'm twenty-four so
D	yeah he's er still got a few more years
D	at some time you have to think about it you
A	I don't really see the point
D	you don't trust me your
C	why do you think it's pointless
A	well I see it as giving money away willingly for someone else to invest and you may or may not get it back I mean I might as well save that money
C	it's a bit of a gamble isn't it?
A	yeah
D	that is the trouble
A	invest it myself
D	that er that is the problem with a with a private pension er yeah with mine because mine's a final salary er I can work out almost to the pound how much I'll get every month
C	and it's completely safe?
D	I put it's it's copper-
C	yeah
D	apart from that it it's copper-lined yeah er I wouldn't transfer it into a tin pot pale comparison er pension it's not the best pension out there there are better pensions but it's a bloody good one compared to private
A	if I had the option of paying into a pension now in fact I did in my job
D	yeah
A	and I didn't want to
D	oh
C	you opted out?
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A prefer to pay it part by part	Neutral
C	do you remember how much that was gonna be?
A	oh a couple of percent
D	you know it's erm something er that I would consider by thirty you don't really need need
A	thirty yeah
D	thirty for you is not that far away
C	no
D	for him it's still he's still closer he's still closer to twenty than thirty you're clearly not and in a few weeks' time I will be closer to sixty than fifty what a what a horrifying thought
[ANNOTATION]	Person D think years are going so fast	Entailment
C	jesus
D	yes
C	how does it work then? how does a private pension work? I give em the money
D	you buy an
C	and then
D	you buy an annuity
C	they add more money to it because they use the money to invest
D	they
C	they're actually gambling on your savings for your future?
D	yeah yes exactly yeah they're not losing erm erm
D	and erm so they can't give you a figure apart from er a final settlement figure as to a projection because they don't know what the stock
C	yeah I guess come thirty I'm gonna have to start thinking about that
D	well you're gonna have to start thinking about a lot of things to be fair erm
[ANNOTATION]	Person D think that if you want to be fair you have to count all the situations	Entailment
D	you know erm er you you look at your life and you try and map it
C	trial and error
D	experience experience
C	error error error trial
C	mm
D	I didn't have a plan I er I never expected where I turned up er ended up and er I can't congratulate myself I can't berate myself either it's all just happenstance
D	that's what happened
C	from your background you've done pretty well
D	I've done better than my old man that's for sure but it was never a race between me and him
[ANNOTATION]	Person D think that he might be better than when he gets old	Neutral
D	yeah yeah so yeah er it was never a race me and him
C	the race now is between
[ANNOTATION]	Person C said that they have comparison in between	Entailment
D	it's between you and yourself in the end
C	and
D	one of you will be blessed with money maybe one of you won't you
A	death by textbook
C	yeah
A	there's no money in my field
C	we're nearly home
[ANNOTATION]	Person C said that they can bring bring money from home cause they are near it	Entailment
D	yep oh good thinking I've gotta go to Asda
C	yeah
D	I'm er getting in there and when I'm sat there I'll say I wonder when
C	how far is Asda from here?
D	not far you've been there we walked there don't you remember?
C	yeah I've been
D	we walked in the snow
C	if there was another Asda
C	which one's the cheaper of the supermarkets? Tesco? Sainsbury's? Asda?
D	Asda's
C	is Sainsbury's the most expensive?
D	no Waitrose
A	but between Sainsbury's and Tesco's?
C	yeah
D	oh but Sainsbury's is much of a muchness
A	really?
D	yeah
C	what does that mean? same same?
A	same same but different
C	yeah
C	hello
A	huh?
C	you do
A	what do I do?
C	massage
C	can I sell you a massage?
D	yeah you had a few of those didn't you?
A	I did
D	that's where all the money went
C	I listened to our recordings from yesterday that was good we got a good few hours
D	yes
C	your voice did sound a little high
D	mine?
C	yeah
D	er
C	you said you were concerned that it was kinda high
D	not concerned but I not er not concerned
C	doesn't sound it to me but when I listened back to it it did
D	it I my voice is sometimes deep
C	surprised
C	according to a a book I read interestingly most men speak at a lower decibel than they actually should do that their vocal chords
D	yeah
C	should be have their voices a little bit higher than they are
D	mm
C	women tend to speak at their correct level
D	mm
C	but apparently men tend to speak a little bit deeper
D	right
C	than they er actually should do by how their bodies are designed
A	yeah
C	so we kind of purposefully put on a
C	I don't think we do it consciously
D	no
C	but men put on a slightly deeper voice
D	a deeper voice
A	it wouldn't surprise me
C	yeah
D	if I'm tired my voice
C	croakier and more
A	oh yeah
C	I thought we just went past Asda didn't we?
D	we have we're going into the back
C	ah
A	yeah
C	do I need to clear a seat or something?
D	no
C	shall I sit in the middle then? and
