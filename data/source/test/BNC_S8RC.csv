B	no no not typically no
A	you have to take your own bags or they give you paper bags or
B	or sometimes
A	you make a box out of stuff and
B	the best thing was that you bought one at the supermarket and it was a big carrier bag but it doubled up as your bin liner
D	oh
A	yeah
B	so you were buying your
A	yeah instead of like
B	that's how they pay for it you'll buy the
B	you're not allowed you weren't allowed you weren't supposed to put your rubbish out in generic bags you had to use these government bought

B	oh you were doing it when you were at work?
D	I was doing it while I was at the place
B	oh right yeah
B	yeah
D	and I know I got distracted and I don't think I went back and finished it
A	oh no
D	the the address of
A	is this like a criminal records check?
D	yeah
B	oh
D	I only had one done in April

B	it's twenty isn't it and that's a basic disclosure
A	did you have to have an advanced disclosure?
B	she has yeah it's enhanced
A	yeah
D	but I er I mean cos it was more over three months I had to have it done again
A	yeah it's ridiculous isn't it
B	it is ridiculous
A	we have that problem every time we go abroad they tell us we need all this documents and it has to be fresh like we have to have a
B	no it's
A	the transcripts from our bachelor's degree
D	oh
A	we have to have them directly send from the uni
B	no they're wood it's wooden inside over there I think
A	to wherever we're going next and then we have to renew it six months on but your degree doesn't go out there so I think it
D	it is innit
C	yeah
D	all the time it's about making money
B	don't touch don't don't put the
C	no well it ain't got the right pegs in it either has it?
B	no it's old it's an
A	yeah my dad lost the pegs so this thing's a bit wobbly so we just kind of jammed these things in and
B	it's functional
A	it works I've got another desk coming up a small one for studying
B	yeah
A	what else? a little bookshelf
B	a little book er actually your mum's bringing the she said she's taking a part of it
A	she said they are I told her that she they shouldn't but she just did it any anyway
B	we'll get a
D	I didn't know if you wanted that little wicker basket to sit on top of the wicker
B	thing to put bits on yeah that would be really good
A	I thought another place below the bay windows might look quite nice with the thing although if the bed's gonna go there
B	with the basket?
A	yeah
B	yeah the thing is once we get a bed frame our bed won't fit where it is at the moment
D	oh
B	so we'll have to change everything around then anyway
A	have to rearrange
D	yeah theirs theirs erm wasn't there it was
B	no no it's big enough to fit the mattress perfectly but
C	but long ways
D	yeah
B	it won't fit the frame yeah have to go long ways
C	yeah you get your cable for the curtains
B	no no this'll never go high enough
A	well I put that well it's been working fine with that thing up there
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	oh
B	and that helps it doesn't look
A	no it looks a bit weird
B	but
A	so we've got the main curtain on and I've bunched it together and then I attached another curtain with four hooks this side and four hooks that side so it's kind of double curtains and
C	yeah you've gotta put it out
A	it works but it's just looks a bit
A	but shoddy but we're students so
B	yeah so it doesn't matter
A	no
D	well I mean
B	is is the rule a tea bag per person for the teapot for a teapot?
D	one bag per person?
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	erm I mean the big ones that were here before weren't students and look how their curtains were
A	well yeah
B	it was all hanging off weren't they?
A	it looked terrible yeah it did
C	and yeah it it was
B	but they were the same curtains as the
D	oh were they?
A	yeah
B	yeah they were in the photos
A	they just didn't look after them I guess
D	oh
B	so I think the landlord probably took the stripped them once that person just you know didn't take care of them for them
D	unless they took them with them
C	yeah
A	do you get your windows cleaned at your place?
C	mm
A	how much does it cost?
B	oh do you?
D	yeah
B	how much is your window cleaner?
D	ten pound
C	ten
A	just ten quid?
B	oh it's ten pounds?
D	for the whole house
B	but ours is only one floor it's only two it's only one set
A	it's gonna be pretty how do they get round the back?
B	don't worry about the back windows really
D	just have your front ones cleaned
C	well
A	yeah problem is we it's our responsibility to
B	yeah but they
A	I mean I think if we left them they'd be worse come this time next year than they were when we arrived
C	yeah
A	so I think they
C	did you tell them about it?
A	yeah I told them I took photos of everything and I think if we just get them cleaned once
C	mm
A	then now then by the time we leave they'll look about the same as they do now
C	yeah yeah yeah
D	they probably won't about that I don't think they've been done
A	no for years
D	yeah
A	yeah ten quid's pretty good
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah it's what we
C	he ain't been for a while has he?
D	no we only ever has done it once every three months
C	yeah
A	do you pay like a yearly subscription?
D	no
C	no
A	or do you just pay as you go?
D	no we pay when he comes
A	yeah
D	but he is about due again I think
C	yeah
A	might have to do that then all feels a bit adult doesn't it?
B	I know
D	looking for a window cleaner
A	getting your windows cleaned yeah
A	I'd get out there myself if I had a ladder for something yeah
D	well your little little table
B	yeah with the sarong on it
B	holding on to the table cloth
A	that'll do
D	yeah
A	did we wanna bring a table over?
B	I was gonna say we maybe want a bigger table out yeah
A	do you prefer that?
B	if you wanna eat some scones
A	yeah
D	well you don't need
C	we can eat here
B	no it's alright we've got some scones that we wanna eat so
A	I mean there's enough for I can sit on the floor here so there's enough room for anyway there's enough room
C	no I'll eat
B	no I don't know
B	we like to do things proper in our house
B	yeah I know
C	they won't last that long will they?
A	they didn't come out very well unfortunately
D	scones scons what do you say?
A	I say scons yeah you say scones
D	I say scones yeah
B	so I say scones
A	I never know which scones sounds better it sounds more posh
A	than scons
B	does it? I think scons sounds sounds more posh
A	were are these scons it's gone over there?
D	I I think it is a scon actually
B	or scone
D	more than a scone but
A	it's both isn't it I'm sure
D	yeah
A	bread bap bun
C	yeah
A	all the names there are
A	and we tried to make them this morning they didn't come out so well through did they?
B	no they're like maybe little rock cakes

A	yeah
D	oh they look alright
B	no not
A	they're just not very high
B	not quite big are they
A	they're fluffy
B	they're like if you combined two together you have almost a scone
A	yeah I'm not convinced you can cut them in half these ones normally you cut it in half don't you
B	no they come out slightly there's not enough room
A	I think we might need a slightly bigger table
D	okay alright
A	I think if we get the tea on there and the clotted cream and the jam

B	ah
D	you cook it with
B	that's cheating isn't it or
D	no
B	is that the only way to do it?
A	that's how you do it
A	didn't look it up just boiled up some strawberries and
A	didn't taste very good
B	put them in the saucepan with a bit of water

B	sort of you know
A	the street I grew up on had loads of erm it was built on an old orchid and there were loads of Victoria plum trees in people's back garden so like everyone would sell them out on the streets or er make jam into them and all that kind of stuff
D	mm
A	I was too young to I never learned how to do it but
D	plum jam is another good one
B	yeah
A	yeah I never liked it at the time

D	we used to have sugar with our strawberries didn't we
B	yeah yeah that's what I'm saying that's what I'm talking about
A	yeah
D	mm
B	I'm sure if
A	I would have gone for it then I'm sure
B	mm maybe
D	that's because

D	so she doesn't eat it
B	she can't she must be doing quite a lot of harm to herself
A	I mean is diverticulitis something to be worried about? my dad really hasn't gone into it in any detail
D	well I think if you watch your diet you you can keep it under control
B	did you eat it all?
D	but she has to
C	sorry darling
B	for a moment I saw it I thought where did it go?
A	all in one
B	mm
D	mm
B	sorry
A	but
A	oh my gosh
B	mm they can be really serious
D	she's always on antibiotics to try and control it
A	I think my dad keeps these things kind of quiet so I don't really know
D	mm
B	yeah no I'm sure it's she doesn't do herself any favours
D	I mean
B	she's been a heavy smoker for her whole life and things like that which does your dad doesn't do
A	dad's on antidepressants at the minute that's not good
C	well
B	yeah yeah yeah my so you know I'll show you or you can figure that one out it's quite clear there's two of these the one that's all gold is the front door and this door will stay open anyway
D	I think
A	mm
D	most of them the amount of my friends that are on antidepressants
A	well sign them up to it yeah
D	and they're fine but once they get on them they can't get off them
A	no my dad's struggling to get off that
B	what the antidepressants well how much was that there now have you are still on your first cup?
D	I am but you can top it up
B	yeah
A	yes I will have a glass of beer

D	I mean she's erm
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah have they not had to do that then though?
D	not yet no
B	because they do
A	so it can be quite serious then no?
D	mm
B	yeah if you're meant to take better care of yourself
A	my dad kind of keeps that kind of stuff quiet
B	I think there's lots of levels of it do you have any in the home mum that are bit more I dunno mild?
D	well we yeah we do have them in the home
A	yeah
D	well er you can eat bread but mm you're better off eating brown bread
A	yeah
D	and you shouldn't eat too much
A	cheers
D	but yeah you can eat some bread
A	I guess
B	yeah probably isn't
A	probably doesn't talk about himself no
B	although she's got I mean is it still just time with
A	what do you mean?
B	like have they just bought her more time or has it gone back into
A	well she's got six months until she has to get reassessed
B	oh right
A	she's had like eight chemotherapy treatments and god knows how many other treatments and for the first time now she's got as six month breather
B	mm
A	I mean it's aged her by about ten or fifteen years
B	mm
A	mm to say that my mum's three best friends one is already dead from it
B	it's a real I feel like it's really increased amongst
A	her mum died of it
B	it has in younger women
D	it has
B	oh it's due to our lifestyle changing yeah yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	as well that's why I'm worried about my generation
D	yeah but if you
B	we started smoking and drinking earlier than yours did didn't we or about the same
D	yeah but if you I mean you
B	counteract it
D	mm
B	yeah
D	I mean you've stopped smoking haven't you
B	yeah
D	and if you reduce alcohol intake
B	yeah by as you get older
D	but as I was drinking my wine last night
A	yeah
D	to a right old age
B	anyway yeah
A	that's what I feel about smoking I'm like oh
A	if I enjoy it so I could live until I'm you know seventy-five and not smoke or live until I'm seventy and smoke
B	yeah
D	well you want to live a bit longer than seventy-five
A	well it's just in my family
B	well I don't know he doesn't
A	if I get to fifty or sixty I'll be pretty pleased
D	well you say that now wait till you get to that age
A	I know I know
B	I know wait till you're my dad's age and then you'll be
A	it's just you know my mum's mum and dad died before they were seventy same for my mum's my dad's mum and dad died before their
B	oh sorry
A	I mean of course I hope so
B	granddad was
A	people do I look around and there's people you know eighties nineties there's plenty of people
B	granddad was a bit like that wasn't he? he had it in his head that he
D	well it wasn't sudden he had erm cancer
B	oh right oh okay
D	he had er prostate cancer
B	oh
D	and he died at sixty
B	so granddad was just
D	my dad was yeah convinced he would erm die at the same age
A	mm
D	I mean he was seventy-three
B	yeah he wasn't
D	he wasn't old
B	no he started suffering quite a few years before that as well that's the only crappy thing about cancer isn't it really is that you've got to suffer for it
A	you suffer
B	you can suffer for quite a while with it
D	well dad's granddad's wasn't cancer
B	oh granddad's wasn't cancer no
D	it was asbestosis
B	yeah
A	well if I follow my original prediction I've only got six years
B	yeah you said thirty-five didn't you
A	yeah
B	when I first met
A	years ago I had this feeling that twenty-twenty was gonna be my final year and er now that's drawing closer
A	hopefully not
B	yeah it seemed a bit further away when you were nineteen didn't it?
A	twenty-twenty I guess I had this premonition when I was younger I dreamt about it quite a bit
B	oh yeah I know yeah I remember you coming to uni and saying
A	yeah
B	I know I'm dying at thirty-five I've had a premonition
A	it's gonna involve a plane
B	but you don't
A	and it'll be in the year twenty-twenty
B	yeah no wonder I'm scared of flying yeah I care about
D	well don't don't fly in twenty-twenty then
A	no
B	yeah
D	for god's sake just don't get on the plane
A	I'll try
B	you say that but what if we're in Africa and we need to get to England?
A	what if you don't have to be on a plane and a plane just crashes into your house or something?
A	it can easily gonna happen
B	Final Destination
A	there's no way of avoiding it
B	have you seen Final Destination?
A	no I know what it's about
B	that's what happens people get off the plane
D	and the one the ones that survive
B	destiny chases them and hunts them down
D	have you never seen any of them?
A	no no no
B	no
A	never seen them
D	yeah it's weird that
A	but I've heard of it
D	you know with you having this it's so similar
D	to what you were talking about
A	to the story yeah
A	hopefully not
D	oh
B	do you want this mum?
D	no
B	no I couldn't manage that other half dad ate mine
A	go on you'll be happy if you save that
B	yeah I know I will
A	get all excited
B	wake up tomorrow I've got a cake
A	they seem so small they're really short
B	they tasted good though
D	they did taste good
A	they need to be about that tall though didn't they?
D	yeah but they they tasted like a scone
B	a scone so it's fine
A	mm do you normally buy self-raising flour or bake it?
B	yeah we used plain and then added extra baking powder which we saw you can do online but is that the
D	mm
A	so that might be why it didn't rise so much
D	mm
B	is self-raising like key?
A	in Korea we can't get self-raising so we've had to be mixing baking powder with normal flour so I did that here but er it didn't rise really
B	they're good to eat fresh scones anyway aren't they?
D	mm
A	yeah you don't want it to be get too old
B	it might be a bit crumbier tomorrow
A	nobody wanted some cake then?
D	no
B	not on top of that no I don't know why you just did that for decoration didn't you?
A	yeah
B	wanted to use the Christmas bake
D	these are pretty oh yeah with that
B	it looks Christmassy doesn't it?
A	are they from
B	there's only we've only got one of them no they're from you
A	oh are they?
B	yeah
A	I really don't remember any more
B	I know
D	what stuff who come from what what
A	who who brought what yeah when
B	I got the violin
D	yeah
A	yes
B	a didgeridoo
A	you're gonna be a bit pro by the end of the year on there
B	we've got oh no we cleared the big one away cos we keep having our windows open cos the weather's been quite pleasant
D	ish
B	more or less yeah like in this whole side the sun stays on the side this side of the building the entire day it doesn't go anywhere I don't really understand
A	yeah
B	it just moves around but because we had them our windows open a lot we keep getting loads of spiders come in
D	oh do you?
B	and
A	mm
B	did a bit of a swoop yesterday cos we get
A	probably about four or five
B	there was there was a bit of a bigger one that kept coming down here
D	oh
B	while we were studying but you can see
A	there's a there's a couple up above the
B	there was quite a big one in the kitchen last night and don't we don't mind them and we're like let them be but we thought well seeing as
A	does she not like spiders?
B	no but I don't know if it's like seen as messy having spiders in your house or dirty or anything
B	I don't know
A	probably
B	so I got
D	how was
B	good yeah we had a really nice day her and
A	she's got a bit
B	and we chatted for yeah she's put on a bit of weight
D	oh has she?
B	but
D	no she's never been petite has she?
B	petite no her frame
A	I
B	but she was she's put on yeah since I mean you haven't seen her for a good few years and she's definitely she's filled out quite a bit more
A	biggest I've seen her
B	she's on the implant this year actually she says she's going to get it removed though cos she's not getting along with it and that might have boosted her weight quite a bit
D	have you done anything about yours yet?
B	no I was gonna
A	keep nagging
B	I mean it's not doing me any harm I've looked into that that far I mean some some people claim that it lasts four years and not three years which I think probably it might do
D	it does
B	but I mean we're not taking that risk
D	it probably gets weaker
B	yeah as it goes along
D	on the fourth
B	fourth year
D	yeah
B	and some of them run out I realised in Korea after two and a half years but that's if your doctor tells you this in advance and if you're obese so I guess if you're extra fat
A	a beast
B	a beast yeah
A	if you're a beast
B	not a beast but obese
D	obese
B	erm I guess it flushes it out it uses it up quicker or something so
A	yeah we did that
B	so that's something but I haven't actually made any phone calls
C	it's really warm out in there
A	yeah it's nice
B	I know it's nice
D	that didn't take you long
C	it's only at the top innit
B	mm it's convenient isn't it?
D	yeah
B	it does mean though every time I come back from anywhere I'm reminded of dad and his just corals every time I turn into the road
A	what did you put down then
C	same what I did before I done before

D	oh my god
A	so I don't that's like eighty books
B	I guess you're not meant to read the whole thing but
A	over the next like three months or something
B	it's a lot of reading
D	oh it's crazy
B	we've gotta do so much
A	and we're having we've already decided now
B	gonna be so busy
A	I'm we're reading four different books at once so we can read a book from each module
B	yeah
A	so you've gotta be good at like getting in and out of four books
D	yeah
A	kind of like do an hour and a half with this book and then an hour and half with this book
D	yeah and and not
A	confuse them
D	fusing them together yeah
A	yeah and actually trying to take in what they're saying
D	yeah that's a lot
A	we're doing different modules though aren't we?
B	there's no end to this yeah we are so that's good we've got to do one together on a Monday but er and I've got to take a language class which annoyingly means that once a week I have to stay until eight thirty

A	the
B	that's not a lot and it really

A	I don't want you cycling in the dark
C	not then no
B	I'm not going to
A	it's too far
B	it isn't that we'll see
A	it's far enough it's a quite a big road
B	got my reflective gear
C	yeah you're all suited and booted
B	we need to go out into the I was going to look into that actually the
A	mm
B	I haven't
C	yeah but we're going to town
B	yeah
A	yeah cool
B	we'll go round the lanes and the high street
D	mm mm
C	yeah all the all the erm
A	you after some like second hand shops or
B	little bit
A	yeah
C	diamonds and all of that there
D	there's a shoe there's a big one up one of the roads isn't there a bit second hand one
C	yeah oh
B	do you remember where it is in relation to the mosque not the mosque the
A	the mosque
C	well the parking where we normally park
D	yeah
C	and we go down some steps where all the shops are
D	yeah we do sort of know from where the
C	yeah
B	only cos we only when we were with
A	they were Korean yeah
B	one of the girls lived in
A	yeah a tiny little place in
B	couldn't believe it erm but that was right round the
A	it's nice around there
B	we were gonna go we were gonna aim for that area and go kind of
C	if I go along by the river
B	I think
C	or by the sea
B	yeah
C	and I'll know where roughly
B	I think the
A	yeah are we walking in or driving in?
B	if you move this way from the
C	driving
A	driving in
B	then everything's on that side I think
D	mm
C	not don't wanna walk down there
A	no not for
B	oh and walk back no?
C	and walk back
B	no
A	well it's not a lot I mean it's about ten fifteen minutes away but
C	yeah
A	with your leg as well maybe
C	yeah
A	now you've got that badge as well you can park anywhere
B	there are an awful lot of hills here aren't there?
D	mm
B	I didn't realise or anything but it says visiting
A	just back yeah
B	cos you follow along but everything else that we've since we've been here is
A	basically there is the sea and then it goes up
C	and then it's up when I did it
B	up yeah and then it comes down to the station the other side so either way we come from our apartment flat we come back up
A	we're on a little hill
B	that's good exercise
C	I was pushing her mother around here once weren't I?
B	yeah I know
B	that's when you dropped me off isn't it?
C	that was
B	yeah
C	thinking oh no look at that
C	then let her go
B	want any more tea?
D	no I think I've had two before I come out
C	yeah
B	oh yeah you did yeah that's alright
C	otherwise she'll be out I need the loo I need the loo
D	I need the wee all the time if I drink too much
B	I mean there's no rush
A	definitely
B	wait a minute anyway yeah
D	I think I might give
B	well
C	do it now
D	well if she hasn't sent that form off yet
B	oh god what about the
C	do it now and then we can have a
D	CRB check
C	and then we can have a have a mosey out
B	all in the sun aren't they
D	I did try her before we left
B	I don't know if I need a t-shirt on or
D	but she doesn't start until
A	we just get five more minutes we've got an hour
D	oh okay yeah that's fine
C	oh was that thing on?
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	almost
B	got
D	I'll
D	but I of course I haven't seen it I'll be seeing them Wednesday
B	that's fine that's fine
D	so I'll get them to do it Wednesday and then I'll put them in the post
B	yeah
A	mm
B	if that's okay and then that way if anything I have got of them already or anything in the future it's just covered
A	covered
B	but I definitely have at least a half an hour an hour of with
D	oh
B	the one with
D	have you listened to it?
B	I listened to it a little bit but I need to listen to it again
A	train should be clear enough shouldn't it?
B	yeah it's just as erm at one point I think the first one might be alright but the second one at one point we get surrounded by eastern Europeans
B	and there's not English anymore so I don't know if you can I don't know if it counts when you
A	well we'll have a listen
A	said if we get five more minutes we've got an hour and then we can just turn it off
A	to force the conversation for five more minutes
B	we er what's really nice is that cos
B	going out eating and drinking
A	we did about two and a half hours of recording
B	we can afford to host people as long as that hosting money comes from the people
B	you pay for your own host
A	just keep speaking
B	so that's fine
A	it's a strange job isn't it?
D	it is a strange job yeah
A	yeah
B	it'll work out well as long as we can keep ourselves cos we don't we have some savings so we just need that little bit more to keep us topped
D	mm just just to keep you topped up
B	so we don't have to be cos if we go down the route of getting a
A	it's a lot of time applying for jobs going to interviews
D	oh yeah
C	yeah
B	cos it's hard to get just the right amount of hours they'll probably make you do more or less than
D	mm
C	we've got mum's putting your things on eBay this week anyway
B	oh what those watches? those er they're not mine
A	we've got enough savings for erm to live haven't we?
[ANNOTATION]	The watches that mum is selling were from their cousin.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	it's just any money we earn is money that we can do stuff with like visit family visit friends
B	how does your erm how does your electricity work? do they read your meter every month or do they estimate it?
C	they estimate it don't they?
D	yeah it's estimated and they read it once a year but I do it all online now
B	yeah
D	so I send them a meter reading
B	and you send them your reading
[ANNOTATION]	People come to read D's electricity every month.	Contradiction
D	so they're estimated ones they've got
C	and our water would be all we can't say what that
B	yeah yeah yeah so that I know yeah
C	so yeah that's
A	how much do you pay on water obviously for
D	well we
B	yeah don't
B	I'll tell you later
B	doesn't matter
A	yeah okay
[ANNOTATION]	They need to put all their money into their jobs at the moment, no visiting friends.	Contradiction
B	but what's typical nowadays what's average?
D	what for well it does seem to vary
B	from household to household
D	yeah yeah
B	well my water out of everything is going to be the shocker I mean we don't use a lot of water
A	well yeah we've been told our
[ANNOTATION]	D believes that the amount you pay for water changes depending on the home.	Entailment
C	with the water or what
B	but that's just a general estimate for this type of property
D	are you are you water metered here? are you in a water meter?
A	is that where you like
B	I don't know
A	put a card in and
D	no no the water is metered as you use the
[ANNOTATION]	To use a water meter you do not require a card.	Entailment
C	out there
A	I mean I guess we might be er there are so many meters out there
B	I'll have to show you a couple of them on the way downstairs
A	that I just don't know
B	yeah
A	there's like twelve different
D	it's like it's in the ground the water meter
B	oh is it?
A	oh so twelve different meters
B	because how would they know we're in four different flats five flats
C	so you must have a meter each
A	yeah there are a lot
B	so how do they know which are ours?
A	there are lot of meters down there
D	well that's that's if it's metered it might not be metered
C	yeah it might not be metered
B	but if it's not metered then
A	thing is we've contacted the electricity that's fine we've got the internet the water company
B	the water company we were on we used our credit on hold to them
A	I was on hold for like half an hour credit run out had to stop
B	no nothing and because they have those recorded messages it it on Skype that
D	oh
B	because someone's picked up the phone
A	so even though you're on hold it's costing
B	it was like half the
A	it cost us about two pound fifty and and
B	we literally waited I think about twenty-five minutes and nobody answered so we were like
A	so I've contacted them via the internet I like signed up but they they were meant to send me out something but I haven't received them yet
B	I'm sure when they want our money they'll contact us
C	don't the agency know where your water thing is then?
A	no they don't seem to do anything really
B	no they're not very useful for things like that we phoned up
A	they gave us a telephone number they said here's a telephone number ring it up and you can find out who your electricity is and you can find out who your water is
D	mm
A	but
B	and they did actually the er company that came and did the inventory for this flat and then we had that external company come and measure up everything
D	mm
B	they had taken pictures of our meter
A	but only the electricity
B	and logged it but only the electricity not the water
A	they didn't take a picture of any any other meter
B	well what confused us is there were four pictures for our electricity and we were like why we don't have four meters do we? but we have some complex
A	we have four tariffs
B	tariff system
D	oh god
A	so like
B	so there's like a
A	it's more expensive at the weekend and cheaper at night and something else
D	oh
B	yeah we have like these four tariffs or complex meter tariff thing
D	oh
B	cos all of our everything is electric
D	yeah
A	so we have to give four readings for the
B	and it's different prices according to the time of the day and stuff
A	I don't know don't really understand
B	so yeah when it comes to reading our own meter we're not going to be able to do it cos we'd have got four down there that we have to do
C	con innit
B	yeah
C	bloody rip-off
D	but
B	he had erm two hundred and something bill at one point
D	yeah
B	didn't he?
C	yeah
D	because there was only one water meter for and there's two flats
A	that's what I'm worried about
B	yeah I don't wanna pay for anyone else's water
D	so I don't know I still don't know how they're sorting
B	cos we erm
A	we're fairly frugal
B	we're pretty frugal and we take really quick showers and stuff
A	we don't run a bath or anything like that
B	I don't wanna be paying for
A	but if I'm paying so that they can have a bath every day it's
B	yeah yeah
D	mm
A	it seems a bit
D	you shouldn't be though
A	mm
D	you shouldn't
B	no
A	it should be separated per flat
D	it should be separate per flat
C	yeah you'd better find out about that
B	yeah well but obviously when there's
C	I know
A	first time in a while
B	wow lucky I'm sat down

B	oh he just needs to don't don't let him don't let him quit don't let him quit now
A	I mean it's two grand a month
B	he's never gonna get employed through
C	yeah
B	anything else ever
D	well I know
B	you can't let him quit this job
D	no
A	it's pretty good money as well
B	that's the sort of thing you can
D	yeah
B	you can learn bits and bobs of the trade on the job
D	yeah
A	he's on about twenty-four grand a year
B	yeah it's good
C	yeah
B	it's a good that's what
C	oh and
B	it's just jumped up on doubled our wages yeah
A	yeah I know
D	I mean he'll he'll easily be able to afford that his rent on what he's earning
B	yeah
D	so
B	and he was talking to me about getting
A	if he's got a job he's got a much higher chance
B	if you yeah
C	yeah
B	if he can hold down a job for a couple of years
A	stable job
B	might actually sort himself out
A	does he like spending money though?
B	who
A	yeah
B	I don't know what's he been like on his wages?
C	well on himself
B	yeah I guess
A	cos you need a
D	well he only
A	you need a desire to work don't you and I guess for most people they like to spend or they like to save but
B	yeah I suppose
D	well he er he's been
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	used to making do for so long
C	yeah
D	borrows off us
A	well he can pay it all back now can't he if he's getting two grand a month
C	well he's god knows what he owes
B	oh he only started on Friday god
C	he owes your mother a hundreds on the quiet hundreds
D	well he borrows every all the time and then he pays back some
C	wanna wash up before we go out?
D	I never get everything back
A	no
B	no I'll just rinse them
D	so you get your
A	just drips
D	cos he gets his erm JSA every fortnight well by the time it's due most of it's he owes out
A	yeah
D	so it's just a continuous cycle
A	gone yeah
D	of him borrowing and paying and borrowing
B	so when
A	that's no good
D	no
A	we wanted to sign up well I
D	neither are mine
A	to get it done in England but they made a new rule now where you have to have been in England for three months before you can sign up it's a new law
D	oh really?
A	yeah so I couldn't just come back and sign up I have to live here for three years and then sign up
D	oh
C	yeah
B	so you can store stuff
A	I guess a bit cheeky last time I came home and signed up for a month and then left
D	yeah
A	so
D	yeah but why not when you've got
A	the benefit system's there
D	yeah
A	you know you might as well use it it's not like the rest of our family and friends aren't all contributing and paying taxes
D	exactly
A	and if your family and friends can't support one person who's not do you
D	mm
A	for what and at the end of the day I mean some people have kind of said to us you know we've been living abroad we haven't been paying taxes in England all this kind of stuff but we paid taxes in the country we've been in
D	mm
A	and now pretty much all of our savings for two years are being spent in England which means they're being taxed and we're paying VAT
D	mm
A	and I've just handed over six grand to tuition fees and
D	mm
A	so really what that money we earn is just being taxed in Korea and being taxed in England
D	yeah
A	I don't find that argument I feel like we do pay our taxes here
D	oh yeah so so do I think
A	we just don't earn very much
C	oh it's twelve o'clock
A	yeah shall we make a move?
B	yeah you're gonna call someone aren't you mum?
D	yeah I'm gonna phone
B	phone
