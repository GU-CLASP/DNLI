D	oh
A	well there you go
B	mm
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	but now
A	do you?
B	oh
A	oh wow
B	yeah
C	you'll be alright
B	exciting isn't it?
D	Smurf he's only four
A	they've gotta sell him?
D	yeah it's like her job
A	what? buying and selling? is it?
B	oh right
A	weren't she importing them from Ireland or something?
D	yeah she got Smurf from Wales
B	oh
D	and he's only four so like he's quite young but he's like better behaved that Cruiser who's like eight
A	yeah
D	Cruiser bit me
A	whereabouts?
D	on my leg and he wouldn't let go and he was like this and I'm like ah
B	oh
D	he's really mean
C	he was after your treats
D	it was at a show I didn't have any treats
C	cos he doesn't get ridden very often does he?
D	he gets ridden by all the little children and like
A	I watched a programme about erm saddles the other day
D	yeah
A	and an English saddle is worth a fortune in America
B	mm
A	paid a lot of money for it
C	mm
B	is that cos it's well made?
A	because it's well made and it's
B	mm
A	beautifully made and
C	I think it all depends on what the
B	mm
C	cos American saddles in this country are mega expensive
A	yeah
C	American styles saddles
A	yeah well the
C	round about two thousand plus
A	yeah
D	saddles are so expensive
A	I wonder if er
B	mm
B	well I guess she does have
C	but er I mean if I I mean if I was to ever ride again I'd have a an American saddle
A	really?
C	mm
B	yeah?
C	cos of just the way you sit in it
A	yeah
B	mm
D	I think you should go on Jasper
A	yeah you've got the upright on an English one ain't you? more upright than on a
D	an American one you're upright on a an English one you're upright but your legs are more of a at an angle
A	oh right
D	you like your stirrups long don't you?
C	I like my
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	I can't ride low I have to them short
B	mm
C	it helps you and then you you've just gotta have it like one hole up on the stirrup length and so you that you can actually drop
A	yeah
B	mm
C	but the American saddle's got a piece at the back and it and it spreads the weight across the horse
A	oh right I see yeah
C	so it doesn't matter what size person you are
B	oh
C	you can get away with riding the horse because at the end of the day out when they're out in the
A	yeah
C	you know when you think about er the riding schools they're only you know they have somebody on for twenty-five minutes then they have a break
D	twenty-five minutes?
C	well some riding schools are thirty minute lessons aren't they?
B	mm yeah
C	and some are forty-five but you're only really on for forty minutes
B	yeah
C	getting on and off
A	mm
B	mm
C	yeah you only get thirty minute or forty-five minute lesson
D	you do with
C	yeah
A	so she
D	no she erm I remember like
B	oh
A	mum had to wait for her with you?
D	no I just poo pick

B	mm
B	yeah
D	well I can't drive
A	of course you can't
B	no
A	well you can you can drive people mad for talking
D	yeah
C	you've gotta get there at the end of the day haven't you so

A	whisky
D	a vital principle within living things
A	oh right
B	ah
C	wow on that note
D	supernatural
B	yeah it's getting deep the conversation now
C	on that note
D	believe or beyond anything that's natural
C	what supernatural?
D	yeah
C	did you hear about
A	do they?
C	they reckon some research they've done research saying there is no such thing as ghosts it is your brain
A	out of your body
C	it's your brain having a moment and it's actually you
A	oh right
C	because
D	see that's why you've gotta turn it off it's because of
C	there maybe there is maybe there is a ghost erm
C	erm it was something along the lines of your brain gets confused so it sees things but it's actually seeing you
A	oh right
C	in that place beforehand
A	so how to premonitions work then?
B	but not someone else's ghost it was you?
C	no it's actually
D	no it is you
C	it's actually you
B	mm
D	but it doesn't look like you it's like someone else
C	because because your brain just
A	changes it about
C	confuses it and everything
B	mm
C	which is interesting
A	that's because
C	yeah
A	we actually see things upside down
D	so you
A	I don't know how it would work when you stand on your head though
B	hard to imagine innit?
A	it is hard
C	it is hard isn't it when you think of it
A	yeah
D	I hate when like my RS teacher he asks really weird questions what really makes you think and it really freaks me out sometimes
A	you don't like philosophy?
D	it freaks me out like
A	well some people think
B	wow
A	that we
D	mm
A	and you there would think totally different like the bad you
D	mm
A	and that's what they call the parallel universe so you've got you've got a you that want that is really what you
D	yeah
C	so when you're being bad you're being good in the other parallel universe
A	that's right yes
C	and when you're being good here you're bad in the other so you're always good
A	yeah
B	oh
C	right then on that note
A	that was very deep
B	yeah yes
C	we're always good
B	very good
A	yeah
