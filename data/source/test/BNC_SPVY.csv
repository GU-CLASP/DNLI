B	right
A	oh well I don't usually watch that BBC programme but
B	what programme?
A	um
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so
B	well they give people the chance to sell their products
A	yeah yeah
B	but in a conversational way kind of way so it gets round the er advertising law
A	which is what all chat shows do but they do it in kind of a newsy kind of way
B	yeah but
A	Cos they slip in the news
B	yeah
A	at the
B	there's a word for it isn't there
A	I don't know
B	anyway
A	but um yeah this um this guy with cerebral palsy was on there
B	yeah
A	and bless him
B	so it doesn't sound like Stephen Hawkin
B	oh okay
A	yeah
A	the poshness makes it a bit funnier
B	mm
A	his whole thing
B	yeah
A	and he um he he presses his jokes to and it reads off the jokes and he kind of does a few actions to go with it
A	and about and so he does a lot of jokes
B	ha
A	yeah
B	oh okay
A	yeah I think it's really nice
B	oh right
A	and
B	what his material was good? Or it was like a gimmick?
A	yeah I think so
B	oh that's good
A	yeah
A	so Ah I think it's really sweet that
B	yeah
A	yeah somebody can achieve something like that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's pretty impressive really isn't it
A	yeah
B	I remember there was a study done on er accents and humour
A	yeah
B	I think they found like the South-East like RP accent was the least funniest
A	mm
B	and they told the same joke in like different accents
A	oh I didn't know that
B	to like a group of people
A	yeah
B	I think it was the Brummie accent that came out top
A	yeah
B	and then
A	well the Northern Northern accents
B	yeah Jordie accent
A	or Irish
B	or Liverpudlian
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah well with him cos it's in a cos you don't expect him to have that kind of voice so it kind of works
B	oh
A	oh he must go past the same time every day
B	oh
A	that's a good experiment actually
B	yeah cos I I hate my accent
A	joke
B	I hate it
A	but we've kind of developed our accents
A	oh
B	that's a peacock
A	well you don't see many peacocks do you
B	no
A	look there it is look
B	is that the female?
A	they've got a nice little little
B	yeah it's nice isn't it
A	thing there
B	ha
A	yeah that's a good experiment
B	yeah
A	if I could remember jokes I'd be able to tell you one of his jokes by I er
A	ah
B	no I'm the same
A	one out of the whole lot
B	nope
A	I can't believe you didn't see him on the TV today
B	well I didn't get up till about well half nine
A	oh mum cooked some good food today
B	yeah
A	I was stuffed
A	like ha oh
B	they were good they were
A	yeah
B	I don't know what happened to the crumpets though
A	oh
B	they were too thick weren't they
A	well I I don't think she cooked them for long enough or she cooked them too high temperature or something like that
B	yeah
A	I think she should have grilled them
B	she fried them?
A	yeah well it gave I don't know it gave her a choice of what to do
B	yeah
A	I I I um I know nothing about making crumpets so
B	no I'd never thought about making crumpets
A	they're they look really hard don't they?
B	yeah
A	well they they obviously are cos mum usually gets most of her cooking right
B	yeah
A	but first try for everything
B	ha
A	but now that they've failed I don't think she's gonna want to cook any more
B	ha
A	she's the crumble expert instead
B	ha
A	ah
B	yeah did you know it's Friday the thirteenth today?
A	yeah I know cos it no cos
B	yeah
A	she was really worried cos she's really superstitious
B	yeah
A	of Friday the thirteenth? Thirteenth?
B	yeah
A	um
B	like there was one like saying Jesus was crucified on the
A	oh
B	Jesus was crucified on the Friday the thirteenth
A	really?
B	I don't know how they would know that
A	yeah yeah
B	you know it all sounds like a load of bollocks to me
A	um what did I think? I though it was something to do with the witches witch craze
B	yeah
A	something to do with the witches
B	I dunno
A	no I have read stories about it but I can't remember them
B	yeah exactly but it each story is different isn't it
A	mm
B	so
A	I was just thinking about
B	yeah
A	number seven was their favourite favourite number in the world
B	yeah it's number sixteen now
A	I used to always tell that
A	and they'd go ah I don't know
B	no I
A	er it might be my lucky number
B	no I always used to er when I was doing that TV news project I made
A	oh yeah and they had Seven News channel
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and I I kept like the government channel like on the flip
A	yeah
B	like on purpose cos every time I put it up er they just listening to the gasps in the class go oh teacher no
B	ah it's funny
A	no
B	it looked like the road between Hanoi and Hai Phong
A	yeah
B	ha
A	yeah
B	and the ticket inspector jumped on the front of the bus like so his like feet were on the bumpers
A	oh no
B	and the driver didn't stop
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has never been in Vietnam	Contradiction
A	oh no
B	and he went hurtling down the highway for like thirty minutes
B	with this  with this  traffic warden just stuck on the front of it
A	ah
B	before he stopped and got chased by all the the locals
A	oh God
A	oh God
B	yeah they're funny
A	do you think afterwards they were oh actually well done it was quite funny when we reflect upon it
A	like they used to with their
B	yeah
A	patting each other on the back
B	yeah
A	but that was a really good scam
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b did not get scammed	Contradiction
B	yeah but it what surprised me the most
A	ah
B	like they
A	yeah
B	like automatically
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has travelled to south-east asia	Neutral
A	well they would do because they have to
B	yeah because they show
A	they have to
B	they have to show have to demonstrate it that they're on the police's side
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b was not surprised wahtsoever	Contradiction
B	even though they're not deep down
A	oh but yeah but they wouldn't want somebody on the back front of a bus
B	yeah
A	that's just too dangerous
B	no
A	that's yeah that's
B	what else did I see?
A	oh I missed that one
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a thinks being in the front of the bus might be dangerous	Entailment
B	there was a er a woman in Bolton who er who got dumped over Facebook by her boyfriend
A	yeah
B	and so she ah she drove her car into the bowling alley that he worked in
A	into the bowling alley?
B	yeah
A	like through the wall?
B	yeah and they
A	oh no
B	and she went flying like literally
A	idiot
B	like really fast straight through the front door and smashed it all up
A	idiot
B	into the the kiosk bit where they give out the shoes and stuff
A	ha
B	she could have done yeah
A	what?
B	yeah
A	that's oh God some people
B	psychopath
A	mind you the Vietnamese driver is just as bad
A	but some people they're just crazy
B	ah yeah
B	it's weird isn't it when you get so upset by something that you don't
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	you don't think of any consequences
B	no
A	and just like
B	you just completely lose it don't you
A	mm
B	I don't think I've ever got to that kind of mentality
A	no
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	I think everyone can get er angry
A	I think I've only been really angry like fuming bright red steam out the ears about three times in my life I think
B	yeah
A	I can't even remember the situations
A	yeah and I had a fight with him
B	mm
A	the build up but there was
B	it is the build up yeah
A	like obviously like it builds builds builds builds builds
B	yeah
A	things get said
B	you just erupt
A	yeah yeah
B	huh
A	but it seems so petty but it's just something that tips you over the edge innit
B	yeah
A	but yeah I don't think it's happened to me much
B	ha
A	oh when I used to drive in the city
A	ooh oh
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's one of those channels you never watch
A	or what is it?
B	I don't know
A	I think it's news
B	but they're promoting it in this village in Belgium
A	what?
B	yeah
A	oh one of those
B	and put it back on the the thing put it in the ambulance
A	oh ah ah
B	and then these two cars came round and it was these guys all dressed in black and they er started having a shoot off with the police
A	what?
A	like with a real gun?
B	well not real guns but it looked real
A	God
B	and then they had like fake injuries as well and fake blood and stuff
A	huh
A	oh my God
B	after the police had disappeared this American football team ran out of nowhere
A	yeah but ah er
B	no no I saw it
A	the whole advert that is the film
B	no it's in the kind of same style as the er that mobile phone that
A	yeah but the whole thing was an advert? Or that actually happened to somebody stood there and pressed a button and it happened to him really?
B	no someone
A	he wasn't an actor?
B	no
A	really? Oh God I'd freak
A	oh that would freak me out so much
B	yeah
A	but it's not he cos he pressed the button so he he might register this is all happening because of this
B	yeah yeah
A	but everybody else who's around there just shopping they wouldn't have a clue what it was about
B	yeah
A	yeah but I
B	ha
A	I dunno
B	yeah
A	yeah pretty clever
B	and another story I saw about university
A	where? Where?
B	I dunno it's one of the ones in London
A	right
B	in certain parts
A	right
B	well
A	you don't have to go in the bar
B	yeah
A	they wouldn't sell beer in the coffee shop would they?
B	I dunno
A	oh
B	I dunno it's one of those
A	I don't know about that
B	yeah
A	like over the top crazy
B	I suppose it's okay if there isn't an area like a social area you can go where they don't serve alcohol
A	yeah that's all they need
B	then that's fair enough
A	well yeah they just need a coffee shop that doesn't sell it so
B	yeah
A	but well maybe maybe that was maybe the universities are going over the top
B	I don't know
A	are they selling it in like vending machines
B	no you can't do that here
A	I've seen it in a hotel
B	that wasn't in England
A	oh
B	I don't know
A	that was that no it wasn't
B	I think Korea that had
A	no somewhere recently
B	I remember they
A	yeah that was Korea
B	ah
A	ha
B	well no that's it
A	even though it is  it is  in a bad state at the moment
B	I know
A	it er it that something needs to be done
B	yeah
A	like
B	and have you noticed how those boxes of beer have got a lot smaller as well
A	yeah
B	ah they're gonna end up having those really tiny cans the size of Red Bull
A	yeah yeah
B	selling beer like that
A	well no
B	well parts of Asia
A	mm
B	hmm
A	yeah it is difficult that one
B	mm
A	you don't wanna lose the culture but you've gotta do something about it
B	yeah
A	if they don't wanna be surrounded by it
B	well it's just university in England you associate the the Student's Union
A	yeah
B	with getting drunk really
A	yeah
B	Don't you
A	yeah when mum was at uni  when mum was at uni  you see cos when she was at uni she used to get everything for free yeah
B	yeah
A	she got her  she got her  sheets washed for free
A	she got like they got their dinners for free
B	yeah
A	it was crazy
B	yeah
A	but they used to do it used to volunteer in there to get your drinks free
B	hmm mm
A	and drinking over their wage
B	mm
A	over what a wage would be
B	yeah
A	I dunno
B	hmm
A	shame it's not like the old days though like when they were all at uni
A	they'll give you some sheets
A	I wish it was
A	I didn't get one single meal
B	yeah
A	and so
B	it's disgusting isn't it
A	they were like how can that possibly be that
A	no not really because they'd never experienced that kind of thing before
B	well you get a tiny box room
A	but it's not cheap rent at all is it
B	no
A	you pay actually I mean it's a ridiculous amount
B	no
A	if you pay for those tiny little rooms
B	the way they re-marketed it was er oh it's the best way to meet people in your first year
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and then they go off to live with their
B	yeah
A	group of people later
B	yeah well I moved in with people doing their masters
A	oh yeah that was
B	it was pretty awful
A	that wasn't good for you was it
B	so I had to join a couple of clubs to meet people
A	oh that's good
B	but it wasn't easy
A	it made you
B	that's how I met
A	yeah
B	so I guess
A	well that that made you get out and about
B	yeah but you know
A	but yeah it's not
B	I didn't have anyone to go to er didn't have anyone to go to the night clubs with
A	the bar with cos
B	do you know what I mean it was  it was  difficult
A	shall we go down that way?
B	okay
A	mm
B	started making friends
A	then you lived with me
B	mm
A	and we lived with twelve blokes and me
B	yeah
A	that was a bit I was a bit gutted at the time
B	mm
A	but I I just had didn't have any female bonds
B	mm
A	mm
B	Cos I remember trying to sell it to you
A	oh yeah
A	mm
B	mm
A	but I enjoyed it
B	mm
A	I mean when the girls moved in the next year I didn't really get on with any of them anyway
B	no
A	er Lou wasn't a girly girl
B	yeah I suppose yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I don't know live with a couple of good girl friends or
B	mm
A	I never
B	yeah you didn't miss much
A	ah I bet you didn't think that at the time
B	well I just got drunk
B	and tried to pull
A	ah
B	yeah
A	everybody puts erm too much pressure on themselves
B	yeah it was the time when you know it was really popular
A	where did you go again? Ibiza?
B	no
A	no
B	I went to Tenerife and
A	mm that's right
B	Benidorm
A	mm
B	and it was the time when all those shows were on TV about the club reps and everything
B	it just wasn't like that
A	and with holidays like that you've just got you've got to drag yourself out in the daytime to sit on the beach haven't you
B	and then feeling sick the next day
A	Cos otherwise you just  you just  flake out and just
B	yeah but when you're not drinking enough water and
A	mm
B	it's too hot
A	mm
B	you know I didn't see any culture or speak to anyone local
A	mm
B	and see anything
B	full of dick heads
A	mm
B	apart from maybe catching Chlamydia or something
A	mm
B	well I dunno really
B	where are these cars coming from?
A	but it does make a erm I think it would make a er a nice group holiday if you got  if you got  the right kind of people all together
B	yeah
A	in like a little cabin and
B	well
A	or one of those cottage holidays we always talked about doing when we lived down in Plymouth
B	yeah
A	remember we said oh yeah let's get everybody together and go and stay in a cottage all together like a group of friends
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	or like a walking holiday
A	yeah a walking holiday
B	well like
A	well we've done walking holidays
B	we've sort of done that
A	yeah
B	they are good
A	apart from cos it was oh I mean oh that was so beautiful
B	yeah
A	and er you know we all had to have a nap in the afternoon
B	well we had to go to bed at about six o'clock as well
A	well
B	with a candle
A	yeah
B	with nothing to eat apart from maybe a pot of noodles
A	oh and they sold those weird fried
B	fried Mars bars?
A	Mars bars
B	did they?
A	yeah but erm
B	where?
A	we and we said when we get to the top we're gonna try one of those
B	I don't know
A	we did and it was disgusting
B	yeah it was disgusting yeah
A	and they get more expensive the closer you get to the top anyway
B	yeah well I'd like to do
A	yeah more expensive and worse quality
B	yeah I like holidays with a challenge in them
A	mm
B	and you get there and you you go yay I did it
A	yeah not just sitting on the beach
B	no it's
A	but snorkelling or
B	yeah
A	or walking hiking
B	I hate sitting on the beach
A	oh I I like erm
B	it's so boring
A	I like a couple of hours on the beach reading my book and
B	A couple of hours maybe yeah and then that's enough for me
A	swimming
B	as long as there's something to do yeah
A	and it's warm enough
B	I'd much rather sit by a lake than
A	we had some good times on a beach though
B	well if there's snorkelling then yeah definitely
A	well we're gonna go and live next to a beach again
B	yeah
A	we keep going and living next to beaches
B	yeah
A	you've gotta ask yourself why
B	well
A	why do we keep ending up in port towns? Harbours?
B	yeah
A	near harbours
B	ha
A	funny innit?
B	yeah
A	I do prefer to be by the sea
B	there was a guy dressed up as a storm trouper
A	what?
B	who walked across Australia
A	really?
B	and
A	why didn't he put it on his back?
B	well I it was too heavy I guess
A	he walked across Australia?
B	yeah
A	whoa
B	yeah it took him I don't know it took him about eight months I think
A	mm
B	it said he was walking for about ten hours a day
A	go on then
B	no I'd love to do something like that
A	A really big challenge
B	but I can't really do it now
A	yeah
B	Cos you haven't got the time
A	when your knees don't go and your
B	yeah and my ligaments are fucked
A	hips pop out
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh dear
B	but I'd yeah something like that I'd love to do
A	maybe we could be those
B	yep
A	like really bulchy not bulchy no like really strong granny and granddad you know going we're gonna go on a trek
A	and walk across all the way around England
A	and just
A	and if your foot lasts
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well it's got better again now
A	yeah
B	yeah well like we were saying yesterday I'd like to do the coast to coast
A	mm
B	I'd like to do Ben Nevis
A	I was gonna buy you one of those um wrist counters for your birthday last year and I couldn't find one
B	A wrist counter?
A	to all the sports shops
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	ah
A	and then you didn't get much for your birthday in the end did you
B	mm mm
A	Cos I  cos I  couldn't find what I wanted and then I ran out of time
B	mm
A	oh
B	mhm
A	well I suppose if you don't get what you want then what's the point of getting what you don't want
B	well exactly I don't really want anything anyway
A	ah
B	it still works
A	yeah
B	yeah that is a problem
A	where did we buy that last fan from? That was from a shop or that actually that should be alright
B	that was just
A	do you want one of those wrist counters one day?
B	what is it?
A	it just it it it clocks how many paces you take
B	er
A	and and and you can time it
B	mm
A	so you go for a jog and like er cos what I thought when we used to go for that little jog around the park and we never could agree on how far it was
A	then
B	doesn't it depend though
A	and yeah
B	does it it what it counts the
A	no it counts
B	is that what it does?
A	oh
B	Cos surely that depends on how big you are
A	oh
B	how big your stride is
A	I don't know how it works
B	yeah
A	maybe you tie it round your ankle
B	it's like a pedometer kind of thing?
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	no I don't know if I would want one of them anyway
A	well I think they're good
B	so
A	what? Can you tie that to your wrist? GPS watch or something?
B	no they
A	mm
B	and it's got a map on it
A	mm
B	it's got them all programmed in
A	mm
B	they come to a scale of like one to fifty but you can then buy better ones like one to twenty-five which I think is the proper like Ordnance Survey thing
A	mm
B	you know where you can see the footpaths and everything
A	yeah I think wait a few years
B	oh yeah there's still lots of problems with it
A	because they can't even make those things to go in the car right
B	yeah
A	yet
B	and also it does kind of take away from the romance of it as well
A	mm
B	just like walking off into the countryside
A	I used to love having like you used to have your map in your plastic bag didn't we
B	yeah
A	and then you get it out
B	that's what I mean
A	and you have a little argument about where you are and
B	yeah
A	and which direction you're gonna go
B	it's all part of it isn't it
A	yeah
B	not having a little a bit of plastic that's
A	if you haven't got that kind of orientation thing
B	mm
A	like all you have to do is walk
B	yeah
A	mm
B	in the middle of somewhere
B	or the satellite goes down
A	mm
B	so you've still gotta have the map anyway
A	mm
B	yeah I love maps
A	but one thing is we usually get somewhere and we say we look at the maps and go well we need one of those
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	and then we get really lost
A	but they're they're expensive cos they took such a they took a long time to make those maps surely
B	yeah but once they're made that's it
A	yeah but
B	it's quite clever isn't it really
A	very clever very
B	all the contours and everything
A	yeah but now they've got like the the stuff from the satellites they can
B	yeah but you can't
A	they can judge them
B	you can't gage the er the height though can you?
A	er
B	on a satellite image
A	I suppose somebody has to walk it or drive it and
B	I don't know how they would do it
A	and measure it and
B	yeah
A	well yeah cos you get those things that you set at sea level don't you
B	yeah an altimeter
A	and then somehow
B	yeah well that's another good thing about those GPS things
A	mm
B	which is good if you're climbing a mountain or something
A	yeah it's good if you know you
B	you have to go back down a hundred metres or
A	yeah
B	before you go to sleep
A	yeah
B	that's good
A	or you're like those crazy blokes who those big rugby blokes that
B	oh yeah
A	what was that place called?
B	I dunno
A	those big rugby blokes
B	no it was about four thousand
A	was it four? I don't know
B	yeah
A	of of you
B	I think the threshold's about two and a half thousand I think
A	oh is it?
B	that's when you can start feeling altitude sickness
A	but it was the highest
B	no
A	not any more
B	no
A	with electricity?
B	no it wasn't that one
A	oh
B	another one
A	oh and they went oh we're alright
B	idiots
A	running up and down the hills having the time of their lives
A	or big big baulky goats cos they had all those muscles didn't they
A	and then they
B	like yeah
A	I was really worried
B	they did look fucked
A	one of them couldn't breath at all
B	no
A	he was going ah huh ah huh
B	they were idiots
A	I know
B	well they were
A	they they went home as well
B	oh yeah
A	they were going to do the same route as us and go all the way round and they had to go home
B	no they just fucked themselves up
A	yeah
B	er
A	hmm
B	right so tomorrow because this bloody game isn't on BBC or ITV
A	ah
B	erm shall I phone the pub in Barnham Broom?
A	I think phone
B	and see if they've got ESPN or
A	I think it'd be better for us to walk to Barnham Broom and watch it rather than
B	but er
A	I dunno rather than
B	well I'll have to phone them up but from what I remember of that pub they've only got like a TV in one of those mounted brackets in the top corner of the room
A	no no they had a big screen
B	I don't think so
A	well phone them up
B	do you know what I mean? I don't wanna go there if people are having their their Sunday lunches
A	it's Saturday
B	oh okay
A	yeah
B	no
A	but I don't know
B	well that's why I was thinking maybe Dereham's better
A	er
B	it might have more of a sporty kind of bar with a big screen TV
A	you've gotta get there
B	although Dereham's not really like that either is it
A	no
B	yeah it'll take an hour to get there
A	you're best off going into the city but
B	then we'll have to
A	yeah if not phone  if not phone  phone the social club and say
B	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah but they have always been fairly nice to us
B	yeah they have done yeah but I feel guilty
A	oh
B	and I wanna watch the game in relative comfort
A	yeah
B	not
A	yeah
B	looking over my shoulder
A	but it was friendlier than the other pub when I know we haven't been in there for a year but like when when we were sitting there
B	what other pub?
A	everybody would say hello as they walked in
B	yeah
A	so they were quite friendly
B	yeah they were yeah
A	like they would walk in and go hello
B	yeah
A	goodnight
B	yeah
A	and even though we kept ourselves to ourselves for most of the night
