C	yeah I think they did
D	but we didn't test it
C	what? it's not you don't
C	the ones that the ones that I've sent across to
A	you could still hear it

D	no get some in Porec mate don't worry
B	do you want me to close this? is that what you want?
A	well

B	you're getting up into the town
A	yeah
B	it's like that
A	mm
C	I was reading in the bulletin in the news apparently some bloke was flying his helicopter and then a seagull crashed through the foot of his erm you know windscreen
B	yeah
C	and erm apparently like it said it died on impact but he said that he had it said that like the bloke had to put his foot over it to stop like flapping about and making him
B	well what dead?
A	the
C	the seagull
B	yeah
C	and he and it said like he he stuck his foot on its head basically to stop it flying around but so it said the die the bird died on impact but if it
B	no
A	where was that?
C	in
A	didn't know there were many
C	well it might it might have been in the
A	didn't know there were many people with helicopters around
C	it might have been in the
B	that could be dangerous a
C	no I don't think it would make a big difference
A	do you know it would?
A	that's why they have airports
C	really? no but
A	yeah that's why at airports they have cars that drive around with like loud whizzers on them to drive away birds
C	oh right
A	the runways
C	see I thought yeah but if a propeller it it goes so fast it'd just chop it up do you not think?
A	well you would think so but it it
D	there have been cases yeah
A	the birds have got into propellers and the plane's crashed
D	but they can actually destroy jet engines believe it or not cos there's hundreds of fans in the middle er on the inside of a jet propulsion engine spinning around incredibly fast
C	it must be a lot of force to get a like thousand is it? or normally tonnes it's probably a couple of
D	yeah
C	baggage and all the people

C	I mean I was thinking

C	oh I thought it was only a one-year course
A	no two
C	oh
B	I was saying this to

A	it's one year to do his LPC and then another year do his GDL
C	sorry so the
A	the first year is the like law conversion
C	yeah
A	the second year's is the graduate diploma in law which qualifies you to practice

D	but he's getting a salary this year isn't he
A	no
D	oh right
A	they give him a living allowance but he doesn't start getting a salary until the third year when he's actually working for them

B	watch out for the deer
C	yeah let's not have a deer through the front windscreen please
B	do they make cars in Croatia
D	I don't believe so
C	would have thought so yeah but it's got kilometres an hour instead of miles per hour so they must make erm
A	yeah but Croatia's
C	yeah I
D	no I don't believe so
B	most countries are kilometres per hour aren't they?
C	really?
B	we're the
C	the correct way
A	pardon?
C	the correct way
B	I remember when I was ten or eleven at school them saying we'd changed from imperial to metric there wouldn't be any more miles or pounds or ounces
A	what that's what they predicted?
B	yeah
C	well we've not got pounds and ounces any more have we? we've got grams and kilograms
A	of course we have we have both really
D	do you work in grams
B	you work in pounds and ounces and I work in grams
C	yeah absolutely I work in grams and kilograms yeah
D	yeah yeah
A	I'd far better know what a kilogram is than an ounce
C	where? oh here? don't know
B	think that's where the police were before?
C	yeah
A	it was yeah
C	what's it's no were gonna say it's a car park but it can't be
D	can I go on the
A	how we gonna get there then?
C	can't get across there
B	sure you can
C	yeah you can
A	I didn't see a sign there for a
C	it did say Pula
A	yeah we're not going to Pula
C	are we not?
C	Mirna I wonder if that's river
A	no it's the name of the river
C	oh okay
D	how many days is it till the EU vote?
A	Thursday
D	oh right
C	so you know your postal votes?
A	yeah
C	will they are they like counted now or are they counted like along with?
B	I think they count them now
C	so realistically you can have an inclination of what the populace is
B	mm
A	no well not really cos it's a very small number of people do postal votes
C	I can't really remember how it all started to be honest with you it's a bit like
A	what do you mean?
C	like the whole EU referendum thing I
A	it was it was the Tory's campaign
B	it's the
A	it was the Tory's whole election campaign
C	see I can't even remember
A	no that they would offer a vote
C	I can't remember
A	essentially they said they thought we that we should go out except now they've backtracked and said we should stay in cos we've got this amazing deal that David Cameron's negotiated
C	well think about it
A	I'm like being sarcastic
C	I know I get that
A	so I'm saying it's hypocritical because they they were saying we'll offer a vote and give people a chance to say that no that we're that we didn't have a good deal and then
C	yeah I get that but then
A	he's he's he didn't negotiate very much at all
C	I don't even know
A	did he dad?
D	erm
A	I don't actually know the exact
B	the only thing I've heard is people coming here can't claim benefits for four years till they've worked here for four years
C	which is fair enough to be fair
A	all I heard that was that that there would be no pressure for us to join the euro or anything like that but what did you mean dad?
D	I can't remember it wasn't too much to be honest with you
A	nothing interesting
D	no
C	I watched a really interesting thing it was like a you know like a BBC
B	see that's that's the that's the entire point
A	that's the concern
D	ignoring the politics and ignoring the fact that it's good for the economy being in the in the EU and just concentrating on a single
A	the
D	stupid
A	yeah people are looking at it from one
D	issue
A	perspective
C	yeah granted but it's not really good for the economy is it dad? because how much do we pay into the EU weekly? it's like lots and lots of money that could be used elsewhere
D	well
C	hospitals
D	we shall we'll if we vote out we'll spend the next ten years renegotiating trade deals and losing trade left right and centre and the economy will go downhill
B	no you've got you've no evidence for that
D	well I have
B	just
D	okay why?
B	listened to the rhetoric
D	well I know that we'll
C	if right
D	have to renegotiate all the trade deals so that is fact
A	well not all our trade deals are trade deals with Europe
D	no
C	but people
D	our trade deals with the rest of the world as well
C	yeah people
D	cos all the trade deals with the rest of the world are based on our on our trade deal with Europe we have to go and renegotiate every trade deal throughout the world which will take years of negotiating and cause enormous upheaval in in business when they should be focusing on selling instead of dealing with that
B	well yeah but that can't be true because otherwise we wouldn't export a thing for ten years
D	well
B	if what you're saying is true
D	it's I'm not saying you can't export a thing for ten years but I'm telling you it it'll
B	well how can we export if we haven't got a trade deal?
C	dad you're snorting but
D	there'll be
C	that's mum's opinion
D	interim because there'll be
C	like
D	interim interim measures but it'll take years of
B	I don't think the fact that it would take
D	people's wasted
B	I don't think the fact that it would take ten years to sort out means that it shouldn't be done I don't think that's a good enough reason
D	well
B	because you could say
D	in the
B	no we're not gonna go to war because it would be five years of blood and you know people dying but you know you know you can't
D	well in those ten years
B	you can't that's not a good enough reason is it?
D	our competitors in Europe will have an unfair advantage against us and will trade win trade against us and we'll lose out massively
B	well it's a bit more than that really
C	I no I I
D	okay well
C	when I start working I'll have to pay thirty percent of my wage but people other people can come in and use my money to have five children and then live off that money that's not fair
D	okay but having the Syrians and the Calais border is absolutely nothing to do with the EU referendum
C	no I'm not saying that
C	I I didn't mention that
C	I didn't mention Calais at all
A	and Syria's not even in the EU is it? so that's got nothing to do with it
D	okay well the
C	dad you you're going off you're going off you're going off now dad
D	well
C	first you were talking about Syrians in Calais which nobody mentioned
D	okay but the issue of immigration will not change dramatically whether we're in or out of Europe
C	it well it will because of free travel
A	well I think it would because if we were out of Europe we wouldn't have to we wouldn't have to adhere to the to the rules of letting people from within the EU in it would still be our decision what we did about Syria and places like that that aren't in the EU
C	absolutely I'm I'm not don't get me wrong I'm fine with taking skilled people on like happily I'd I'd take you know if you've got a diploma in engineering and we've got a shortage of engineers come on in
C	an engineer engineers sorry come on in but I'm not I'm not happy when Bob who's come from Romania with
A	I don't think dad
C	no high school degree and a you know it's
D	well
C	not fair
D	up from Romania without a high school degree is working in the fields that no English
B	they're not
A	it's not true dad
A	not working
B	not working
A	I
C	yeah
A	for so many years before they can take out of it and I don't think that's racist at all I think that's just
C	no it's not
A	common sense isn't it?
C	it's just fair yeah
A	it's fair
B	pregnant women go back to Poland because they do a scan every month they fly back when they're pregnant and have a scan every month as well as the scans here
[ANNOTATION]	person B is not sure about pregnant women	Neutral
C	with with with I mean the systems we have in place the NHS is nearly at breaking point the education system is
A	well it
C	in a bad state
A	it's in a bad state cos there's primary schools where look at
B	well there's a group been set up hasn't there next to
A	but still even if a child who knows the basics that teacher's gonna have to spend more time with those children you know getting them to understand and teaching them and then the other children are
C	miss out
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about spend more time for child	Neutral
A	being left by the wayside but like even if I I I think anybody who hasn't contributed regardless of whether they come from abroad or not in fact you know I don't think
C	I didn't even know I could get Jobseeker's when I was eighteen
A	of course you can
B	but his parents have
A	yeah his parents have but regardless he hasn't I don't think people should turn eighteen
B	well
A	and that be an option to them cos if it wasn't an option
[ANNOTATION]	person A is not sure about how many option have	Neutral
C	they'd have to work
A	people would go and get a job
C	we need
B	I think the the real issue is addressing how politicians in Europe abuse the finances there
A	well that's a whole different area that
C	yeah
B	well yeah but how much money have they saved?
C	yeah but if we get out what's the what's that you know leave them to it
A	I'd be happier voting in if we
B	what did you vote then?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about vote	Entailment
A	I voted in but I'm saying I would be more
C	I know that's that's one of the big sticking point for me I don't like the idea of somebody who's who doesn't live who doesn't live in the country who doesn't really have an idea of what the country's all about deciding our rules that's just not fair
B	that's not even touched on all the displaced refugees
A	what do you mean?
B	well you know they'll er they've taking on like
A	from Syria?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	I know
A	but
C	that's true yeah
B	and if you reattributed some of the money that's being wasted in Europe you'd have money to put back into a systems that would suppose those people when they came
C	yeah but it boils down to this thing whether somebody's come in to abuse the system or
B	they take forever and a day don't they to decide
A	to decide
B	anything
A	people have been in the country for ten years on asylum
A	the government
C	right
A	the system
C	yeah
A	meanwhile that person can't work because they're an asylum seeker they have no right to work so we're paying for them to be there for ten years whilst we make the decision whether they can stay or not
C	yeah
A	this caravan's a bit of a slow-mo
B	whoa

A	the green car's thinking about overtaking there's too many cars there's about seven cars in front
B	well we're not in a hurry we should just keep our distance and drive
C	he's swerving all over the shop this fella
B	what's this?
C	there're like they're like mini churches aren't they like? I don't know they're not mini churches but you know what I mean?
A	like shrines
C	yeah like
A	at the side of the road
B	what is he? what he said
A	they're little churches
C	yeah I get that but I'm saying are they like a memory of somebody who's died? or
A	no they're religious
C	yeah I get that
B	but it's like it reminds you cos you're supposed to say so many prayers a day aren't you? so you could I I think

A	come on person behind the caravan
B	chill out
C	it's not the person behind the caravan it's the caravan
B	what's your problem?
A	it is the person if the person behind the if the person behind the caravan overtook then the person behind behind the caravan could overtake and we could all get on with our lives

A	she's working at
B	that's right
A	this green car's desperate to overtake isn't it?
A	I can't imagine it's got the horsepower to do it
C	I know this may sound really really stupid but I was thinking do they call it horse do they call it horsepower because a horse you know the mode of transport used to be a horse and cart? so like the horse the the higher the horsepower the more horses you had so the faster you'd go
A	I think that's where it's come from that
C	see
B	yeah
C	just
B	it's an old English term isn't it?
C	Einstein just eat your heart out
