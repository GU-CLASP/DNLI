A	fifty?
B	no
B	there's six different packs of different types of custard cream
A	oh good god what do you mean different types of custard creams?
B	they've got chocolate cream orange cream strawberry cream
A	oh my god wow
B	coconut cream digestive cream
A	good god
A	who invented these creams?
A	oh god so how was your weekend in general though? how was it? was it good?
B	yeah
A	was it nice to be home?
A	yep yep hung hung the
A	it's yeah and now it's all soaking wet
B	good
A	yay
A	I know weekends I think go really quickly at the moment
B	this one particularly though I don't know why
A	mm
B	fine
A	yeah
B	he's fine when he's not around her
B	mm
A	god
B	he's like
A	really?
B	mm
A	to be fair I think that's really unfair like a lot of men don't come forward because because of domestic abuse
B	mm
A	because they think it's like unmanly or whatever
B	mm
A	such bollocks
A	that's so sad
A	yeah
B	like is there a refuge for men?
A	there probably is something but
B	yeah
A	it's just not very well documentated
B	it's not
A	domestic
B	it's not it's not physical it's
A	that's sometimes just worse that's not worse like
A	mm
B	and he hasn't got any money and she doesn't give him any money like doesn't share
A	yeah
B	he's got nothing
A	but then again it's like why is he with her? why doesn't he just leave her?
B	well then that's
A	mm god I'd hate to be in a relationship like that obviously er er anybody would hate to be in a relationship like that
B	mm
A	yeah
B	that's not an issue like you wouldn't have ever thought that there was any problem
A	mm
B	he just gets he suffers from really bad anxiety now
A	ah
B	and he's got
A	yeah
B	like he's got
A	oh yeah yeah like through stress like IBS triggered through stress and stuff
A	yeah
A	mm
B	he was like I I don't know what's what's what happened really like my stomach hasn't been playing up at all since I've been here
A	ah
A	ah that's er bless him
B	mm
B	mm
A	apart from just look after him when he comes over and just spend time with him
B	luckily he's been assessed by er mental health
A	oh that's good
A	that's really good
B	housing association and domestic abuse people
A	oh wow brilliant well not brilliant but you know what I mean? like it's good that they're taking steps in that direction
A	it's just
A	like
B	yeah
A	and the amount of things she sees she's just apparently on average it's a woman is either er physically abused or emotionally abused forty-eight times before she calls the police
A	I was just like forty-eight times
B	mm
A	on average that means somebody must've like taken er like a hundred beatings before they called the police
B	mm
A	that's it's just horrendous isn't it?
A	cos you always think oh if I got if my boyfriend or if my husband hit me I'd go straight to the police or I'd leave him but you
A	like as much as I like pretend that I'm like a really strong person and all that kind of stuff if I was in love with somebody and he hit me I'd still be like oh he was having a bad day and it won't happen again
B	yeah
A	cos you just would
B	you would or you'd say oh maybe I pushed him to
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	and and if you probably got into that mindset for a long time you'd just start believing it wouldn't you?
A	yeah er yeah I
A	I as much as I'm ashamed to admit it if my if I was in a relationship and he hit me once I probably would take him
B	I probably would as well
A	I probably would take him back
B	I probably would
A	second time I would be like fuck no
B	yeah
A	the first time er I always I would always try to give someone the benefit of the doubt
A	which I know in that situation you probably shouldn't
B	and then er then you're opening yourself to always letting it happen
A	yeah exactly yeah
B	mm
A	but erm yeah at least your uncle's getting the help he needs
B	hopefully
A	well yeah fingers crossed
A	boring
B	she doesn't want to like help herself and it's really frustrating
A	yeah people who don't wanna help themselves really oh they just aggravate you don't they? cos you know what they have to do and they know what they have to do they just don't fucking bother doing it
B	well it's like she I dunno I tell her all this stuff that she can do but she doesn't do it cos she doesn't feel like she can do it
A	mm
B	like yeah yeah everything that you say to me makes sense and er I understand everything you're saying I really appreciate it and it's like well
A	do it then
B	do you understand or not? if you don't understand then just tell me and I'll try and explain it to you better not that erm obviously my way is the high way but
A	no how old is she?
A	mm
B	it's not
A	mm yeah
A	what? the people you work with or?
B	no this couple
A	oh really?
B	kept bringing it up like over and over again like I'm saying you know you
A	erm were they? hang on you went you took wait a minute you went to
B	that wasn't a day off though I don't think
A	and you've been to the Dominican Republic so where else do they think you?
B	I went to Portugal
A	okay but that was like
B	but that was only
A	that was in July
B	she was like oh well you're lucky you get to go on holiday
A	well I'm sure you went on holiday when you were younger
B	exactly
A	oh
B	they really made me feel really uncomfortable actually I was just
A	ah
A	yeah there's only so many times you can kind of laugh it off and brush it off isn't there?
B	yeah
A	and then you're just like fuck off
B	I really wanted yeah er and I probably can't really say fuck off to them
A	no not if they're an old person no
B	fuck off
A	fuck off you annoying old bitch
A	I think you'd get fired for that
A	yeah
B	oh I'm I'm really sorry don't tell anyone
A	and then you'd be like yeah but she has dementia she doesn't know what she heard
B	no she hasn't got dementia
A	damn it
B	she hasn't
A	oh
B	she's convinced that she has got dementia but she hasn't
A	oh god
B	she's really difficult actually
A	mm
B	tomorrow then I've got I've not got to see her for another four weeks
A	oh that's good then
A	so what's she complaining about? she doesn't normally see you in four weeks anyway
B	I know
A	so
B	I didn't miss any appointments
A	no well
A	oh god I thought you were I thought she was like annoyed because you like missed an appointment or something
A	god okay fair enough what an annoying woman
A	no they should be like wow that's awesome erm like I hope you had a good time
A	no
B	exactly
A	go to someone else someone else can get lumped with her
A	ah
A	really?
A	yeah I'm just trying to help you and if this isn't helping
A	yeah
B	she's not very good at exploring

A	mm
A	it's a good
B	well the that's that's

A	and like erm CIE we have to put in a bidding sometimes for books
B	mm
A	er so we bid for like to publish fourteen books last year for them
B	mm
A	and we won them all so we published fourteen books however apparently we're the worst performing publisher in getting the books out

A	so there's us OUP Hodder and Collins and we all bid for products and then like er what are they called? what's it called? when erm begins with B does it?
[ANNOTATION]	they were unable to publish any books last year	Contradiction
B	okay
A	so you you go in for er you go in for the tender and then you win the tender and apparently of our fourteen titles and compared to everybody else's we're the worst performing
B	oh my god
A	but it's only like I think because we've got like some really difficult titles
B	okay
A	and then I realised that we
B	oh
A	and er that means I'm literally
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b wrote a book when they were a teen	Neutral
A	I'm nearly like er fifty percent of the failure is really my fault
B	yeah
A	the candidate numbers in the whole country are like two hundred people the products are gonna cost us like forty grand to make despite the fact that the candidacy is only for like two hundred people
B	god that sucks
A	like yeah it's er
B	why have you got them?
A	I don't know they're non viable we should never have done them they're costing too much they're taking too long and the author's just no
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is not making enough money	Neutral
A	and I and and they were just like and
B	that's good though
A	yeah yeah it was just it was just when she said that I was like oh crap I'm the project coordinator for like four out of the ten
A	so
B	it's fine
A	yeah
B	mm
A	what are we gonna do about the sofa?
B	it's fine I'll take it I'll pay you fifty pound and take it
A	oh okay well or twenty-five it was only like a
B	it was a hundred I think
A	oh was it?
B	mm
A	oh okay
B	so there's fifty for my bed as well
A	oh fair enough
B	sure it was wasn't it? yeah
A	yeah I thought yeah
B	mm okay yeah that's fine
A	oh yeah it was yeah
B	mm my mum was like it's a really good sofa so if you don't want it I'll have it I was like okay fine
A	yeah yeah
A	so that's fine with me
B	yeah
A	I guess you can take the bed apart can't you?
B	yeah could probably have that at home anyway cos it's quite a nice bed
A	would you
B	only on the
A	oh okay
B	which is fine cos he's never really home anyway
A	yeah
B	cos I have I've actually
A	yeah
B	it was actually just going back into my own room
A	exactly
A	mm
A	it'll only be for like a year like?
B	not even hopefully not even two years
A	yeah
B	it'll
A	mm
B	cos it was two years from now about eighteen months hopefully
A	how much are you planning on saving?
B	if I can save five hundred pounds a month then I'll have six thousand off by the end of the year and then see what we
A	yeah and also the government have a Help to Buy scheme
B	yeah
A	and
B	he's got a lot saved up so
A	yeah
B	and maybe I can bring something else to the table like the sofa
A	and cooking
B	yeah
A	but also even if like the initial deposit deposit is slightly more him
B	you'd still pay the same
A	you'd still pay the same mortgage
B	yeah
A	and you could just contribute like an extra hundred quid towards the mortgage each month or something like that
B	yeah
A	like you could always work it out that way
B	yeah
A	like in the grand scheme of things if he put in what? like fifteen grand and you put in seven grand or something in the grand scheme of
B	no
A	against like a hundred and fifty thousand pound house
B	no
A	so if you did break up it wouldn't be like well I have seven thousand pounds more invested in this house it's like so?
B	I'd probably just walk away
A	yeah I'd be like it's seven grand
B	it's fine
A	you can have it
B	just take it
A	yeah
B	well you never know we might do
B	I hope not if we were buying a house together I really hope not but you know
A	oh god just imagine if
B	jesus christ
A	yeah
B	I know that's hard
A	like this was only what? they started going out maybe in the August
B	mm
A	of last year
B	mm
A	he left the end of September October last year so what? they've been going out let's say they've been going out for like six weeks
