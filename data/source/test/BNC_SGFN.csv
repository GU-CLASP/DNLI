A	he doesn't look
B	they don't don't think
A	well he does
B	and also you get all the rubbish stuff from the erm deli counter when
A	oh yeah
B	gonna be the bit of ham that's on the end that
B	I always refuse to have
[ANNOTATION]	The person who owns the deli is C's uncle.	Neutral
B	cos it's dried out
B	and it's the bit they want to get rid of
B	oh
A	honestly I don't mind value stuff but it's literally unedible isn't it? inedible isn't it
C	yeah
B	well
A	it's disgusting
B	we do buy the Collier's Welsh cheese which is more expensive but
A	I buy whatever's on offer you know from the whole range of cheese there's always one that's a good one that's on offer and that's one and I buy
B	but you've really got to keep your eye on it because the
A	mm
B	cat like the cat food the big bags of cat food they're normally fourteen pound forty-nine
A	wow that's a lot
[ANNOTATION]	There are different offers on cheeses depending on when you buy them.	Entailment
B	but occasionally it er a particular supermarket will put them down to ten pound
A	mm
B	and unfortunately I had to buy one for fourteen forty-nine just before we went away on holiday but
B	yesterday I noticed they were ten pound
A	yeah
B	so I bought one
[ANNOTATION]	B missed the opportunity of buying a discounted bag of cat food yesterday.	Contradiction
B	but it's just
A	have bought two or three
B	well I should have done really erm
A	might go off though
B	I know but
A	and the cat might not like it
B	but then and you've got to carry it all back here for him
A	mm
B	erm
A	but some people they they go on their apps and things and find out which products
[ANNOTATION]	B has no pets.	Contradiction
B	well
A	are going cheap and then go round all the different
B	I know but
A	er universities? different
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	B has a cat but he is a predator and captures all his food.	Contradiction
A	big
B	and that the other type of cat food Waitrose sell it the cheapest or they did do
A	Co-op
A	have you seen the Co-op special offers? we
C	and Ben and Jerry's ice cream
A	Ben and Jerry's ice cream a big one erm a baguette all of it the whole lot for five pound
B	oh amazing
A	it's ridiculous
C	and then we went into Co-operative just up the road and the Ben and Jerry's alone was four ninety-nine
B	yeah yeah I don't think our Co-op does offers like that I've never seen it
A	it probably doesn't need to
B	no I don't
A	ours is in a place where there's you know
B	is that too done for you?
C	mm
B	do you want me to scrape a bit off?
A	oh
B	well it's easy to do
A	yeah
C	thank you
A	erm
A	yeah so
B	I know it is I but you you I can't spend my life doing it so I just I mean er things that are really expensive like cat food I do and I'll buy them on the internet if
A	yeah
B	and get them delivered to
A	I mean we've got
A	you know because
A	Morrisons and the prices have gone down actually in Morrisons but if you do go to Lidl and stuff it is a lot cheaper
B	oh yeah
A	on the other hand I don't particularly like the meat
B	but you can't do all your shopping
A	or the fruit the fruit's not as good as Morrisons not nearly so
B	oh
C	and the meat's not very nice
A	the meat's not very nice either
B	oh no
A	so we don't buy it so we're not
B	no
A	we end up with a loads of stuff without the meat and then you actually haven't got anything to cook so
B	mm the trouble is you just can't well you could spend your whole life doing it and then to be really pleased with yourself
A	oh
B	that's not life is it?
A	no hardly
B	mm
A	it's a complete waste of time
B	I mean we can do all our shopping from here with the Co-op the butcher's the baker's
A	mm
B	well I make bread anyway but
A	yeah well you could do actually but the meat's not particularly good at the Co-op is it? do you think?
B	oh no because we've got a butcher's
A	oh you've got the butcher's yeah
B	yeah so no
A	well in that case you could but it's
B	erm you say that but
A	some of it's alright
B	they have some nice steaks
A	the sausages are
B	and erm you need to be careful what you buy cos they
A	they don't have free range do they?
B	adulterate a lot of it you know they put like some sauce
B	already which I don't like but the some of their steak's really good actually
A	really?
B	I quite often buy a small steak and chop it up
A	yeah
B	then just fry it quickly and then put it on a salad or
A	they probably
B	erm
A	have different stuff than than they do
B	they have free range chicken and
A	oh do they?

A	remember ever having conversations about what do you want to be apart from at primary school when you said you wanted to be an air hostess or
B	oh yeah well
A	whatever you know I don't remember
B	no I don't think we we at
A	no
B	at all

B	and er and just in
A	just
B	you know like they like
A	aim high and
B	to print in the paper ninety-seven percent of our girls have gone to university
A	yeah

B	and she had her favourites you know
A	mm
B	and erm she'd known them since they were
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said she know them till they were there	Entailment
B	well cos it's you
A	all of
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think all of it cause of him	Entailment
B	cos you're his mother
A	I know do you think that's what it is?
B	yeah totally
A	in that case
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah but you don't feel like that do you?
B	between mothers and daughters normally than mothers and sons
A	but it's for us it doesn't seem to be does it
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	because it's not come to the crunch point yet
A	what what crunch point?
B	but also yeah
B	well I mean
A	I don't know I mean
B	it is for really difficult yeah I mean
A	it is really difficult yeah because it's not
B	but parents are not the best people to
A	no
B	to help
A	but the trouble is
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think there is a problem in between	Entailment
B	at all
A	you know university now for for
B	but therefore he needs to do an apprenticeship or something but they
A	well that's what he that's what he's gonna try and do
B	do you know we had some brilliant people to do some jobs around the house that needed doing
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is thinking about the thing that Person B is saying	Entailment
B	erm and he was saying about the government are just cutting back on all the apprenticeship opportunities
A	they're meant to being
B	they said they'd love to have an
A	I thought they were doing the opposite I thought they were increasing
B	mm
A	the numbers
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b says that there are now less apprenticeship opportunities because of the government	Contradiction
B	well well they're making
A	they're gonna they're aiming for three million
B	I mean and we had to have an electrician recently to do something and he's he was saying exactly the same is that erm it's there's just disincentives to do it
A	erm
B	I know they're saying that they're doing it but they're not
A	no
B	actually doing it
A	to have someone?
B	yeah
A	yeah and the government don't want to put any money into it cos they don't want to put any money into anything do they?
B	well exactly and I think I think also it it you know it if you say you've got to go to university to study to be an electrician or a plumber it kind of devalues it in a way
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b says that there are now more apprenticeship opportunities because of the government	Contradiction
B	because
A	yeah but that's not the sort of apprenticeship
A	he wants to get into marketing and business erm business management and marketing
B	he needs to erm
A	go to university
B	he needs to do an MBA or something
A	and he can't do that until he's done a degree so
B	no
A	erm
B	well he could get try and get taken on by an employer doing something and then they could
A	yeah and then they
B	a lot of employers do
B	pay for you to do a degree and that sort of thing
A	yeah
B	I mean it was just a bit unlucky that they
A	cos they would
B	didn't pay for her to do her MA
A	they might have done in this job
B	mm
A	but then she wouldn't have got the job if she hadn't been
B	well I I know so
A	mm it's lovely this bread isn't it?
C	yeah really it's delicious
B	do you want some more?
A	erm
C	I'm fine thank you
A	no thanks
B	mm I don't know
A	we could slice a piece off for
B	he won't be able to cut it himself?
A	I don't well not evenly and if you don't want it hacked up I think he'll probably find it difficult cos we
B	doesn't really matter I'll I will cut some more bits
A	mm
C	yeah
A	have we? stop it then
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c said no	Contradiction
