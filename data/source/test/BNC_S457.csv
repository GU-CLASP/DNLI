A	yeah
C	a bonus
A	yeah

[ANNOTATION]	Person C is agrees that he couldnt be present at school when he is at vacation	Neutral
A	no why should they?
C	oh yeah
A	even so I just I think it's fair comment to ask for a few more days
C	I see what you mean but
A	I I'd I'd fight the school over that
C	well I do think that
A	if they're fighting you over days off in school time I'd fight them over that without a shadow and
B	I think he could have done it all the Friday night before he came out
A	well he had Saturday morning as well but that's just
C	and the Sunday night as well
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	so he did have three nights
A	or the Sunday

C	yeah I know all of my birthday I was trying to talk to her and I sat next to her at the table and she didn't reply
A	no she didn't bother mm
C	you can tell when somebody wants to talk to you and she didn't want to talk to me so

B	yeah well
C	I just
A	there's nothing I can do about that

A	I thought she was
C	moody family member
A	she was alright I thought

B	and I think it was that she'd done it and it was fine
A	but she didn't ask him about the printer then?
B	well he did it
A	yeah but I said to her if she's gonna call him she may as well ask him if he's got any ideas at what she could do to clear the printer
B	oh I didn't ask that I don't know

B	whereabouts?
C	we we haven't got it our franchise hasn't got it and
B	where is it? whereabouts are you going?
C	I'm not sure where it's going it's up to the new
B	so a big a big unit then
A	is it gonna be where they're extending that ground you know behind the erm
C	possibly you know yes well I know where
A	you know you know where they've done the roadworks?
B	oh
A	yeah by the New Look
C	by New Look
A	so that's I mean there's there or there's over by erm
C	mm
A	over the Next or John Lewis side but I don't think it'd be any good over there it needs to be in the main shops doesn't it?
C	I reckon it'll be there yeah
A	who's having it?
C	it's definitely going cos
B	compete don't they?
C	compete for it and our franchise hasn't won this one
A	oh right I think it'll do well there
C	oh yeah well like I said it's well we all know that's why they're gutted they haven't got it
A	oh right
C	they'll do really well there
A	well it's like why would you put one there? and I thought well actually why wouldn't you?
C	why yeah
A	I think it's a perfect place for they've got no jewellery stores at all
C	it's absolutely
A	they've got loads of shoppers of that you know
C	yeah
A	of your target market
C	yeah it'll be absolutely rammed
A	they'll make a killing
C	no
A	you know you are in the flagship store
C	yeah no
B	I wonder how big that'll be then cos it's all those units are quite big down there aren't they?
C	mm
B	with Boots and that and you've Next and that
A	well it's not gonna be that big is it?
C	like like mum said on that
C	do you know you know by New Look there yeah I reckon
C	yeah it's a shallow
A	mm
C	it'll probably be quite long I'm not sure
A	everybody coming out of Kentucky Fried Chicken or whatever it is around there
C	yeah it is KFC and Costa and
B	Costa
C	Roasters
B	Marks and Spencer's
C	yeah
A	with every one?
C	the majority yeah
A	is there one on the high street? is the is the high street in
C	yeah
A	is it?
C	yeah and they're opening a new one as well
B	have you have you got some sort of a connection with them then
C	no I don't think so
B	or they're just by
C	I think our franchise likes to always go next to a Primark
B	so
C	but Primark's Primark is our customer like you say it's not expensive
A	well it's fairly expensive
C	it's fairly expensive but it's a treat isn't it? and they'll spend all of their money on getting a charm
A	mm
B	true
A	how's Mother's day looking?
C	I haven't looked yet
A	when are your next days off?
C	Wednesday
A	next Wednesday and Sunday?
C	Sunday
A	when does your week go Monday to Sunday?
C	it it does now yeah
A	so you've had your days off for this week and so you next week you've got Wednesday and Sunday?
C	I don't know
A	ooh
C	so I might
B	but you do the rota though?
C	yeah I do the rota I haven't done these rotas the old manager did them I haven't even looked at doing a rota yet
A	well the old manager never worked by all accounts so there's no surprise she booked herself off for these
C	yeah
B	oh
C	mm
B	okay so so she
C	yeah had both off she's had this whole week off as well
B	but
C	she's had a week they've just given her a week's pay
B	to think
A	what?
C	for not yeah to have time to think
A	who told you that?
C	about what she wants to do
A	but you get
B	well for her yes but
A	well why not for everybody then?
B	well for
C	I'm new
B	a ladder a a a
C	be running
B	be successful otherwise
C	you wouldn't think so would you?
A	are you gonna contact
B	I I read it I read it
C	we were together when he had that
A	oh right so
A	what he'll do is forget to call you over the weekend and then Monday morning he'll go
A	where are you? are you getting the next flight up? so you'll have to make an effort to phone him
C	are you are you gonna go
C	dad are you gonna go
A	as long as he's paying you I don't care what he thinks
B	mm
C	mm
B	well he he did employ somebody
A	we haven't got any man
B	but according to
B	they thought it was just ticking off pipes
A	yeah
B	and erm apparently there's some
C	they didn't want to do it
B	and then this other bloke didn't wanna do it so
A	the other bloke just wanted well normally it's just
B	something
A	all it is is writing pipe numbers down
B	mm
B	ah
C	ah
A	so they wanted it cleaned out
C	oh
A	that's the point it was a bit
A	what what they do is they have to flush it through with a a high pressure water anyway before they start using the pipeline so
C	oh
A	it seems a bit pointless to scrub every pipe
C	to put it underground
A	they're they're just I think they're just being stalling for money that's all and they're usual tactics anything they can do to stall payment
B	mm
A	that's where you go wrong
C	but why why are you
B	I don't I don't know I don't he said in
A	just
B	all he's described it as a as a er a fair degree of manual labour
C	ten-hour days?
B	I'm sure a ten-hour day for
C	oh okay so he just the one day ten hours that's what he wants you to do?
B	that's what he's saying isn't it?
A	it won't be ten-hour days because for a start it's too dark to offload at the moment after
B	mm hm
A	up to two hours
C	mm
A	four pipes on a wagon to look at
B	so
A	if we haven't got
B	his ten hours is probably
A	and it won't be ten hours if we haven't got anybody
A	when when if you haven't got anybody on-site then erm they'll just claim that they never had the pipe or they didn't have those numbers or
C	mm
A	it's it's just to get
A	that's what it's for
B	fine
A	there's a you need four-wheel drives for the
C	three days a week for how many weeks?
A	well they've got two shipments this is the first shipment they've got another container load of pipes coming in
C	how do you know
A	so
C	this mum
A	er
A	Christmas meals
C	wow
A	there's a lot of pipes
C	mm
A	so that's why I know they're doing two shipments
B	well he hasn't he hasn't really
A	he won't give you details you'll have to learn on the job but that's all you need to do is write down pipe numbers and and just make a note of everything that you think they might complain on
B	photograph the numbers
A	don't send it to
B	fair enough
A	as long as you cover your tracks like that then er
B	it's something different isn't it?
A	well yeah just take a few take your thermals you'll be needing it more than
C	it'll be cold
B	mm hm
A	is it just you for tea tomorrow? normal time
C	I don't know I guess I'm seeing

B	oh right
A	other high street shop were having the police in
C	I'm going to the police on Tuesday
B	okay
A	well that's like a week after it happened
C	I know
A	this is pathetically slow
C	it's crazy isn't it?
A	they've got pictures of her
C	yeah they just want me me to
B	oh right
A	so they didn't capture her and they haven't got her then?
C	no
A	was this when it all happened on Tuesday?
C	yeah so she did it on Tuesday day then when I left on Tuesday night about quarter to six three people came in and no sorry one person came in and stole three rings
A	off the stand? how did they do
C	so that day we lost four rings
A	do they do they cut them off? how do they do it because they're attached? how do they?
C	have you seen them? have you pulled one ring up before?
A	well yeah only to put it on my finger as you would
C	yeah yeah
A	and it's attached
C	yeah it's attached but all it's got to do dad could yank it off if he wanted
A	oh you've just got to pull it hard?
C	yeah
B	you need to have someone stronger
C	you literally just have to like
C	push your like finger like around because it comes up about this much
A	yeah
C	so people can try it on with different rings
A	yeah yeah
C	and stuff and you've just got to pull it like that and
A	I wouldn't think
B	and yank it
A	you'd be yanking it I
C	yeah exactly you wouldn't nobody would
A	no
C	unless you're a scumbag
C	which is what these people are that steal them
A	mm
C	oh she's selling them and then she's buying drugs isn't she?
A	oh
C	the old drug run
A	everybody what off erm what's his face?
B	yeah desperate times come desperate measures and they they'd do anything to get their money don't they?
A	you have a very cynical view of the world for a twenty-two year old
C	what does cynical mean?
B	she's probably right
A	what does cynical mean?
C	it is right it is definitely right she mum this woman is not doing anything else other than
A	mm
C	she's completely out of it she's off her face she can't even she doesn't even know where she is what she's doing
A	I don't I don't know having never been on drugs been high or met anybody like that
C	well that is you wanna work in retail for
C	a week and then meet a few people
A	maybe she's trying to feed her family maybe?
C	oh she hasn't got a family or to be fair she probably has and they're probably
A	on benefits as well
B	in care
C	in care that's the right word dad
A	you can't go around it?
C	no you've got to face it
A	you've got to go straight to it
C	and that's what she's doing
A	well she's probably moved onto another area by now
C	reached the next
C	she can't get very far she won't drive she won't pay for a bus
A	well she won't
C	you can't get into
A	well how does she get into
C	she probably walks doesn't she? she probably lives like on a street somewhere
A	mm
A	what I can't believe is there must be people stealing within shops in
C	she's stolen from our high street store and ours and now we had
A	how many security have you got in the
C	oh I could not tell you
B	to book an appointment
C	you have you have to go out and flag one down
A	oh
C	well you wouldn't walk out your store that makes you more
B	yeah you wait there a minute and I'll go and find
C	you follow me if you want to er beat me up outside that's not a problem I'm not
A	well
C	and then the panic alarm's in the office
A	well I you just think erm that end of the
C	mm you'd think so wouldn't you?
A	well I I do think so
C	I mean we do we do some on a Saturday
A	mm
B	there's a there's an
C	we're having security at Christmas though
A	what?
C	a security guy for our door
B	right yes
A	laid on by Pandora or TH Baker?
C	TH Baker
A	not by the
C	not by the
A	oh well that's
C	so we're gonna pay for somebody to be our security man
B	right
A	oh well that's good
C	I'll love that I will
B	a step in the right direction
A	absolutely
C	I'll be able to say anything I want to any of them
A	oh you could have oh you could have yeah
C	I
A	absolutely
C	but I would have loved to have done it
A	yeah I know but you it's not worth your safety
C	and it's mm
A	yeah but
C	does she think I am? oh I haven't got that ring well where has it gone then there's a gap?
A	she knows you're not stupid she knows you know she has it
C	but she's taken it
A	yes
C	and it's in her pocket well give it me back
A	but she would have hit you or thumped you or and then
C	and she tried
B	stop you
A	yeah but then you're in danger so what's the point for a hundred and sixty quid
C	a hundred and thirty
A	well what's it cost Pandora? a tenner
C	that's so true isn't it?
A	it's it's not worth it
C	and then when the owner comes in and laughs it made me feel much better because he's obviously not arsed about a hundred and thirty quid is he?
A	no and it and it happens I mean they've got you know they they've built that into their figures they've got theft in there there's a figure for that
C	yeah
A	they're they're
C	yeah
A	there's figures built in for that
C	yeah
A	they take account of it
B	they would be more concerned or more
C	mm
A	you could sue them
B	and then TH Baker would be in right trouble then
A	and then they yeah
C	would they if she had have hit me?
A	yeah because
C	what would happen?
B	oh yeah
A	well if you you could have sued the company
C	what?
B	for not providing adequate
A	for not providing the adequate cover at work and you could probably come away with thousands hundreds of thousands
B	so then more
A	depending on what damage they've done to you
B	they would
A	let her walk away
A	yeah
C	well that's that's me I don't want somebody to hit me
B	no of course not
A	that should be everybody's philosophy
B	yes yes you don't want to get involved in any of that
A	used to
B	take the money that's what we used to do in the bank
A	I was gonna say when your dad was at the bank
B	if you want some money
A	have it
B	here you are have it
C	how do these people get away with it?
B	it's only money
C	how do they? like you say they come to the bank and you just have to give it them
B	yeah but

B	people would er attack people as they left the branch for instance
A	and they'd come back in all beaten up and
B	yeah that's what they had yeah
C	yeah?

C	I've still got my eyebrows
A	I see you've still got some money left in there so don't lose it
C	I know
A	well how much money is on there?
C	I need to remember this don't I?
A	well you do otherwise it'll it's a shame because
C	twenty-five pounds
A	you know auntie
C	yeah but
A	erm
C	you see I need to just plan in when you're
A	mm
C	is she?
A	well the trouble is she doesn't
C	it's never on my day
A	no
C	and the thing is I don't want her to just come here for like a six pound
A	well she's coming to me next Tuesday just for that
C	is she?
A	oh I can't make what does that is that Monday? Tuesday? she's coming next Tuesday that's just for an eyebrow one two
C	mm hm
A	well I thought she was coming there
C	because I'm not really a regular customer am I?
A	well I
C	what time?
A	what?
C	you see again if she came in the morning I'd be able to go to work on the afternoon
A	well I don't know you can do Thursday is gonna be a late when I
C	I don't know
A	okay so there's there and then we've got
A	one
C	what dad?
A	then there's the fourteenth of April
C	at
A	you're never gonna get a day off on a Thursday
C	is that
A	she only works Thursdays and Tuesdays
C	oh she does
A	so
C	so I'll try and have a Thursday on the fifth of May
A	well she might not be able to fit you in
B	she only does two days
A	yeah she does she does a Sunday
C	does she?
A	she'll come out on a Sunday she says so if she's you know if you just want an eyebrow wax if she's around tonight in
C	yeah
A	but then you don't know if you're off on a Sunday then do you?
C	no it's a tricky one this is
A	well why did
C	no
A	well yes
A	if they're twenty
C	well yeah
A	twenty-five?
C	twenty-five quid
A	yeah
B	yeah it's
C	that's a very good idea
A	she didn't buy a particular thing she just bought cos I've still got a manicure mini manicure left on my voucher from
C	oh for
A	yeah
C	well make sure you write it down cos
A	yes
C	so you use the voucher
A	give you the money then can't I?
C	there we go all problems sorted
A	well it is really yeah yeah
C	so I don't have to try and book a date off
B	no
C	cos I don't really have the time to do that sort of stuff these days
C	no it isn't mum
A	no
C	not an option
A	ah it's busy being you I remember being busy
C	I wish I wasn't
A	fitting everything in
C	no I wouldn't
A	yes you would
C	I'm not
B	doing leggings aren't you?
A	have you bought your train pass yet?
C	nope
A	when are you gonna do that?
C	I don't know where to buy it from for a start
A	well I would say
C	I'd say
A	is that where you're gonna do it from?
C	because if I work a late or if I go in at ten o'clock there is no way I'm gonna be able to park there
A	okay
C	yeah but sometimes I do a ten till half six
A	well get it from
C	mm
A	which is a couple of stops can't you?
C	it's yeah it's only like it's I think it works out at five pounds something to get a pass
A	for
C	so yeah a day so I'd be saving what? a couple of quid a week
A	five pounds to get a pass or eight pounds not to get a pass a day
B	eight pounds a day that is
A	that's three pounds a day
C	three pound
B	it's almost half price that is
A	that's fifteen quid on a five-day week
C	oh yeah
A	that's sixty pounds a month
C	that's a good saving
A	of course it is
C	alright
C	mm
B	you should go online and find out how to get a pass
C	yeah you do I asked him
B	oh right
A	have you got any photographs from passports visas any recent?
C	yeah I should have a photograph somewhere
A	if you've got a recent one that saves you doing that as well doesn't it?
C	yeah
B	mm hm
A	go online sort yourself a
C	yeah
A	and you're saving money which can't be a bad thing
C	no it can't
A	okay
C	every penny counts
B	I used to
C	really?
B	yeah
A	I don't know that was always a bit of a thing peculiar to the bank I thought
B	I don't know
C	mm
B	I don't suppose there'd be and I don't know whether the
C	no London Midland
A	well it'll tell you on the website won't it?
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	what you can do I don't think TH Baker will pay you but er
[ANNOTATION]	saving is a bad idea	Contradiction
