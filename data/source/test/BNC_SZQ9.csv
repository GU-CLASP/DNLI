B	yeah you can't get to them at all
A	cos cos
B	you can't you can't get to this this running lamp
A	yeah
B	without jacking the car up
A	mm
B	up to it
C	mm
B	I mean well it's stupid
A	yeah
C	it is silly
A	well it's like I the the lights on there you can they got
B	yeah
A	different bulbs and then they got a side light as well
B	yeah
A	and on the back of it they got this sort of big sort of rubber thing you pull off and all you can get to there is the
B	yeah?
A	the other one is tucked down god knows how you you know I've only had to renew the the dip bulbs
B	yeah
A	but like you say it's the same thing
C	mm
A	I'm now thinking that perhaps you just have to take the whole unit out
B	yeah
A	but then I'll bet you if you tried to do that
B	oh
A	there'd be some
C	mm
A	some nut which is you'd have to take the bumper off to get to
B	that's right yeah
A	and like
C	mm
A	the the bumper on that I've tried taking the bumper off to get to something else and
B	yeah
A	but on that one it's held in with rivets
B	is it?
A	so you have to
B	oh my god
A	drill the rivets out to get the bumper off
B	oh my goodness yeah
A	so
C	yeah
B	weird innit?
A	I dunno god knows too easy to
B	well they make everything
A	yeah
B	so complicated I mean if that computer went in there that would
A	mm
B	you know cos
A	yeah like there's no reason why it should cost you a fortune cos
B	no it's a
A	I mean you can buy electronic gizmos for next to nothing can't you?
B	you can yeah you can
A	so why is that?
B	I dunno
A	why is a car computer so expensive?
B	I dunno
A	it's only a little chip
B	yeah
A	and they must make millions of them and
B	it's got two computers that one
A	yeah
B	it's got it's got er
A	yeah it's a braking computer no doubt
B	that's yeah that'll tell you oh tell you everything
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Two people discuss Desktop computers	Neutral
B	what's going on you know er there's
C	I don't know
B	and I always always have it on one anyway to tell me what speed I'm going that's the
A	but the thing is that these new MOTs they've got
B	failure yeah
C	mm
B	you need a new computer in it yeah take it out and put in a new one
A	I mean the only the only good thing about it is is that
B	well that's right yeah hopefully
A	I mean look at these Kias where they get a ten-year guarantee don't they?
B	yeah yeah
C	that was ours wasn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	Two people confused about the product to purchase	Neutral
B	lifetime er guarantee
C	but if you read the small print
A	yeah
C	I mean
B	yeah read the small print
C	and you don't
B	and you've gotta have this that and the other one
A	and you've gotta spend five hundred quid with them every year
C	obviously it won't do for tyres
B	yeah
C	it won't do
B	that's right yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Two people discussed about the offer	Entailment
C	you know
A	so you're probably better off buying a
B	yeah
A	you can buy private warranties
C	yeah it's
[ANNOTATION]	Two people fixed with one product to purchase	Entailment
A	it's like insurance
C	really a guarantee at all
A	you know where you actually pay them
B	that's right yeah
C	mm
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	Two people fixed with purchase and discussed about insurance	Neutral
A	mm
B	but you have to pay so much money
A	yeah
B	than you would on HP or whatever
A	yeah
B	for the lease but anything go wrong
A	yeah
B	that's all done
A	a lot of people do that
B	yeah
A	don't they
C	yeah
A	do that now
B	yeah firms do this
A	cos like the one time if you had a firm's car
C	does kind of make sense sometimes
A	if you had a firm's car they would then
C	mm
A	help you or or lower your your tax cos
B	that's right yeah
C	cos they were saying you're getting so much benefit from it
B	yeah
A	but if it's a lease car
C	yeah
A	all that
B	no
A	and you know yeah that money you're paying
B	yeah yeah that's right yeah
A	you know?
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean quite I think quite a few people buy cars like that now
B	yeah I think they
A	cos they do this thing
C	mm
A	where you give them a a deposit of
C	yeah
A	fifteen hundred quid plus lease it for ten years
B	that's right yeah
A	and then or for six years and half
B	three years it is
A	is it three years?
B	three years yeah
A	and after three years you're gonna either buy the car
B	that's right yeah
A	or have a another
B	have another one
C	just
B	yeah
C	mm
B	and they
A	yeah
B	they sell it
A	I mean for people who want a new car that's
B	yeah
A	that's sort of quite a good deal
B	obviously you
C	yeah
B	you get your first three years free of MOT
A	yeah
B	so you don't have an MOT for the first three years after
A	but that's weird isn't it?
B	ain't that weird?
A	you know you could have bald tyres you could be driving around with
A	bald tyres
B	you could be
A	you could be driving you could nick the
C	is that no MOT or just free MOT?
A	no it's no MOT
B	no MOT
A	for the first
B	three years it is
C	that is silly isn't it?
B	yeah we didn't when we bought first bought our Zafira
C	I thought it was just free I didn't
B	we didn't have an MOT at all for three years
C	oh right oh
A	I mean you could have er damage underneath which is deadly
C	of course you can
B	well you could have anything going on with it couldn't you?
C	could be lethal couldn't it?
A	yeah
B	you
A	I mean that's the only way I know
C	especially
A	this car's reasonably safe is that I put I through an MOT every now and again
B	well don't I think it's wonderful
A	I know it's er
B	I think that
A	and it means they'll tell you what's wrong with it and
B	yeah
C	it's nice to know isn't it?
B	the things we used to drive
C	just gonna put
B	eight
A	mm mm
C	get the
B	and they had cable brakes and and you'd literally have to stand on them if you were going down a hill
A	mm
B	no
A	if you braked you'd always be
B	they'd pull over one side or whatever
A	you know skidding around
B	yeah
A	mm
B	but then that only done up to about fifty mile an hour anyway so
A	mm
B	you know?
A	yeah that's true
B	no they weren't were they no
B	yeah
A	whereas you get in a modern car like yours I expect that could do about a hundred and twenty
B	well I haven't tried it
A	if you had it flat out
B	do you know what
A	mm
B	but you wouldn't know it
A	well
B	well it would push you back
A	yeah
B	and I don't know how the how they done it
A	but don't you even feel it changing gear?
B	no you don't feel it
A	mm
B	oh
A	yeah they've come a long way ain't they?
B	they have yeah
A	mm
B	but they that's called trip computer there's two two trip computers on it
A	mm
B	thing and that'll tell you that you're done thirty miles an hour
A	so it has got some sort of satnav otherwise how would you
B	well it's got something it it cos
A	how do you know the destination?
B	it it would
A	how do they know where you're going?
B	a hundred if you do a hundred miles
A	it don't know where we're going does it?
B	no it don't know where we're going
A	so how can tell that you
B	I've got that bit wrong
A	oh
B	not your
C	how many miles you've done
B	how many miles you done that's it
A	and how many miles you've got left to go
B	and how many miles you've got left to go
A	ah right
B	that'll tell you that
A	yeah
B	and er
A	mm
B	I mean we're only got it on
C	average speed and that it tells you doesn't it?
C	which is usually about twenty-two miles
B	yeah
C	an hour
B	ain't that weird?
C	even if you've done a long trip and you've done over
B	you you do over seventy mile an hour along a motorway right?
A	yeah
C	well seventy
B	and you
C	perhaps
B	well seventy mile an hour
C	yeah
B	yeah that's what I said seventy mile an hour
A	yeah
B	carry on that speed
A	mm
B	five minutes and then you go off
A	well that's not even five minutes is it?
B	no
A	barely a minute
B	yeah that's right
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and then you go off and and you're
A	yeah
B	going behind a load of traffic and
A	mm
C	I mean
A	because
B	yeah
A	it's about a hundred and thirty miles right?
B	yeah
A	so you think oh sixty mile an hour that's only two hours
B	that's right
A	why does it take four hours to drive there?
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	and like most of that is on a motorway
B	that is yeah
A	where you're just
C	yeah
A	thundering along
B	thundering along yeah
C	yeah
B	and then
A	you know why does it take four hours?
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	can't make it out
B	no
A	if it was blooming
C	yeah
A	if that was er
B	oh god
A	obviously on there
[ANNOTATION]	A flower is what's blooming.	Neutral
B	that's
A	no
B	is it finished yet?
A	they've still got a forty mile an hour limit on it ain't they?
B	have they?
A	yeah
B	oh god whatever for?
A	and you get all the traffic nosed up so you're actually only doing thirty
B	yeah
C	mm
B	why have they got a forty mile a limit on it still?
A	well cos there's still roadworks
B	yeah but
A	and you know they don't like
[ANNOTATION]	There used to be a thirty mile an hour limit.	Neutral
B	yeah but they they don't work on Sunday and yet it's still forty mile an hour
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	I mean we've been down there and it's still
A	that's just
B	forty mile an hour
C	yeah
A	that's just to annoy people I think
B	yeah
C	well I suppose they can't change it just like that
B	no I I can understand them having forty mile an hour when when
[ANNOTATION]	They're working on Sunday.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	when they're when they're digging holes and
A	well it's like
[ANNOTATION]	The speed limit is definitely forty miles an hour.	Entailment
C	mm
A	on the motorway as well innit?
B	yeah
A	they say
C	mm
A	oh roadworks ahead fifty mile an hour
B	fifty mile an hour
A	and you drive for miles and miles and miles at fifty miles an hour
B	yeah
A	the
[ANNOTATION]	There's some traffic on the motorway right now.	Neutral
B	end it says
A	what was all that about?
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	I I don't want I don't to ever break the speed limit
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B loves to break the speed limit.	Contradiction
A	yeah my sister I went to see her the other day
B	oh yeah that's a bad bit there innit?
A	half past one in the morning
B	yeah?
A	and got done by the speed camera for doing thirty-four miles an hour
B	what?
[ANNOTATION]	The speed camera caught him/her running with fifty miles per hour.	Contradiction
A	on a thirty mile an hour limit
C	that's awful
A	eighty-six quid
C	but it's so easy just to do that extra bit isn't it?
A	I mean at one o'clock in the morning
C	yeah
A	when you're crawling along there it's I mean if
B	you feel silly don't you
A	yeah
B	when someone er drive up behind you and you're going thirty mile an hour on
A	yeah
C	mm
B	and there's nothing at all around
A	yeah I tell you what I'd rather like through
B	yeah
A	cos twenty mile an hour you are in definitely in slug hard mode aren't you?
B	yes you are
[ANNOTATION]	Twenty miles per hour is quite a slow speed.	Entailment
A	you know what I mean? you're just sort of like okay crawling along at twenty mile an hour
B	yeah
A	which is plenty fast enough actually when you
B	yeah
A	except that all these others cars wanna do thirty right?
B	yeah well the the other cars behind you
[ANNOTATION]	All cars want to run with 40 miles an hour.	Contradiction
A	and once you're doing thirty it's so easy to do thirty-five
B	that is yeah
C	yeah
A	you know if you were doing twenty and you speed up a little bit
C	yeah
A	and you're still
B	yeah
A	going less than thirty
B	luckily we we got
C	yeah
B	a thing on our our motor
C	when you
[ANNOTATION]	They usually drive in a very high speed.	Neutral
B	we haven't used it yet
C	yeah?
B	and you put in I don't wanna do over thirty that won't do over thirty
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't want to go over 30 miles an hour.	Entailment
A	well they need something like a big hammer
A	it goes bang
B	yeah
B	yeah you can put your foot down
A	yeah
B	and that'll go up to thirty and then
[ANNOTATION]	That will go up to fifty.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	and that'll slow it but we haven't use it
A	but you can you
C	couldn't you ask them when we go
B	yeah I will
A	you can see it in a few years' time
C	show us the cruise control
A	that cars will have built in satnavs
B	oh yeah
A	and with built in speed control as well
B	yeah
A	for towns
B	well you can see that coming off
C	mm
B	can't you?
A	you know
C	they should do
A	and you think well if they're gonna be so
B	yeah of course it is yeah
C	yeah
A	you know and then there'll be someone say oh yeah but what about if I want to accelerate to get out of a problem and you say well if you're doing thirty there won't be a problem
C	if everyone's doing the same
B	there shouldn't be a problem
C	it's not likely to happen is it?
A	mm that's right
C	really
B	yeah there there was a
C	especially if they have
B	yeah
C	radar
A	mm
B	yeah well they've got that now
A	I mean
C	so that you can't
A	yeah I mean like with erm with satnavs and things I mean the the they already
C	mm
A	can you know put in I mean they're so accurate aren't they
B	yeah
A	they can stick in where the thirty limits are and where the forty limits are
B	that's it yeah
A	where the fifty limits are
B	well they
A	mm
C	mm
A	I mean you know okay you can still drive
B	yeah
A	and you'll be driving along
C	yeah
A	and suddenly woah we're out of the limit the car speeds up
B	that's it yeah
A	off you go
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	but
A	yeah
B	but the people could drive round
A	yeah
B	and they drive round and and the town
A	mm
B	but there was hundreds and hundreds of cars all just going round
A	mm
B	and round and down and up and round and round
A	what was that called that film?
B	oh god knows
[ANNOTATION]	Most of the cars were Jaguars but there was also a Rolls Royce.	Neutral
A	cos he did get out I the end didn't he?
B	he did get out in the end yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A did not like the film.	Neutral
B	whatever was it called?
A	it was a television show weren't it?
B	was it a television one was it?
A	that's right it was er
B	yeah
A	but you couldn't the people living there didn't know
B	no that's right
A	and they couldn't get out
B	that's right yeah
A	and he got out in the end yeah
B	he got out yeah
C	mm
A	what on earth was that called?
B	oh god knows that was a really weird
[ANNOTATION]	They watched that movie last year.	Neutral
A	mm
B	really weird
A	that's quite that was quite interesting weren't it?
B	yeah
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A can't remember the name of the movie.	Entailment
B	yeah
B	what's the time?
A	that says ten to four
B	oh dear
A	it is yeah
C	mm
A	never mind it'll get darker before it'll get lighter
C	so it was a better day than normal
B	it will
[ANNOTATION]	They are reading the time on a big clock at the square.	Neutral
C	wasn't it?
B	yeah it was a better day than normal yeah
A	yeah it was alright
B	yeah
C	it's quite often dark all day and
[ANNOTATION]	C thinks it was a particularly good day.	Entailment
[ANNOTATION]	C says it was a particularly good day.	Entailment
B	yeah it is and
A	yeah
C	hate that
B	well
A	well the last couple of days it's been really overcast hasn't it?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is not sure about it either	Neutral
C	yeah
B	it was so miserable
A	mm
B	and we and and we because the day was so miserable
A	mm yeah
B	and and you're just you don't want to do anything you know
A	yeah
B	you get oh
C	only cos
A	well I've got these
C	I've always said I I you know
A	mm yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	yeah maybe	Neutral
C	and then it went it comes and you think oh no
B	yeah can't be bothered
A	that's right I got
A	I've got erm
C	yeah you do don't you?
A	and one of them is
[ANNOTATION]	not what Speaker A thought	Contradiction
B	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	and the pipe the overflow pipe went out and I said to the blokes oh when you put the new thing on you can cut them off or if they if they you know or or just knock them back you know
B	yeah
A	so you don't have to cos they're all redundant
B	over
A	the empty tank
C	yeah
A	and it's sort of like sitting on top of my trapdoor now
B	oh wow
[ANNOTATION]	Something is sitting below Speaker A's trapdoor	Contradiction
A	so I can't
C	oh dear
A	so what I've gotta do
C	oh
A	is to
C	oh
A	you know what I mean?
B	and push the tank back
A	so I can get up enough to
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will lift the tank	Neutral
A	well I can't push the
B	no you can't can you?
A	I mean it hasn't gone completely over it I hope
B	no
C	oh
A	but somehow I've then got to wriggle up there and then cos it's an iron pipe
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A can push the tank	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	like push it back or push the I'll be up against the er
B	oh god
A	the er gutter
C	mm
A	but you know what I've gotta do is cut this bloody trapdoor in half
C	yeah
A	so I can get up there and then make a new trapdoor
C	yeah
A	and then it ain't the easiest thing is to cut the trapdoor in half when it's shut
B	that ain't is it no
A	you know I can open it about that much
B	you got a jigsaw I suppose?
A	yeah but you're all upside down you see
B	you're all upside down yeah
C	yeah horrible
A	what I'm gonna do is to and of course you're underneath it so all the muck is falling on you all the time
B	of course it is yeah
A	so you've gotta dress up and all this lot
B	and not only that with them trapdoors you've got two thicknesses you've got the thickness of one bit and then the other bit that's holding it together in the
A	that's right yeah
B	on the top
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and then you've gotta watch the nails
A	and then you've got all that
B	that's it yeah
A	you know
C	oh
A	so I think I'll drill a hole and then I've got this little or
B	yeah yeah
A	and I'll saw
C	yeah
A	that a little bit until I can get the the other saw in there
B	yeah
A	I've got another sort of
C	oh
A	have to use that saw it right through with that
B	yeah
A	but it's a matter of being up the top of this ladder
C	mm
A	and being up there with this saw like this
B	well I've got a jigsaw if you want to borrow it
A	yeah I've got a jigsaw as well but you can't really get it cos it's recessed you see
B	oh I see yeah
A	you might be able to do a little bit with the jigsaw
B	yeah
A	you know what I mean?
B	yeah I know what you mean yeah
C	mm
A	but it you can't cos it's sort of recessed about that deep
B	ah
A	it's not sort of a
C	mm
A	flush
B	oh so your jigsaw
A	and then when I've done that I've got to get up there
B	back yeah
A	and then make a new trapdoor
C	yeah
A	all for the sake of these guys me telling them
A	to push it back
A	dear oh dear
C	oh
B	oh dear
A	that's one job but that ain't the sort of job you look forward to doing
B	no it isn't is it?
C	no
A	you know it's gonna be
B	that would be
C	yeah
B	wouldn't it yeah
A	the other job I've gotta do is to box in the
C	oh
C	oh
A	but I've been putting that off for ages I've
B	that's
A	got used to it being all pipes and that sticking in
B	yeah
A	see things like that don't worry me but I mean
B	no no they don't worry me
C	oh
B	until someone come round
A	mm
B	and you think mm look at that you know
A	yeah
B	you think oh dear
C	mm
A	anyway
C	mm
B	yeah
A	be that as it may
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	mm
A	she's teaching this
B	is she?
