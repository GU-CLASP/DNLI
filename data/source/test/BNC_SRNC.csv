A	it's a
B	I know
B	in the library I get very self-conscious
B	I don't know why it is

B	oh and we can we can take a picture of it and then just go to the
A	yeah that's fine
B	or Asda
A	yeah
B	sure they have a setting
A	wait
B	the way we set it
B	oh there's no yeah
A	that fits on like one of the Asdas
B	mm
A	regular size
B	but then we need to know the dimensions
B	yeah we need to know the dimensions for the so we cut it out and the direct the slice
A	mm quite hard I suppose it won't be too hard so long as we've got the dimensions on the internet
B	they they are though yeah we've done our passport photos before
A	well
B	but then do they give you a
B	if it doesn't work it's something like
B	I don't think that's what they mean I think they mean like you can't say if I took a photo of you
A	oh okay
B	here you can't zoom in
A	oh I see
B	and then
[ANNOTATION]	It's going to be very difficult, even if the dimensions are online.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	see what I mean?
[ANNOTATION]	B has prepared their passports photos before.	Entailment
A	so we could do it I suppose
B	have you got like a blank wall?
A	not cream or grey
A	my sister's room is a plain white wall
A	cos that visa that is an online application and print
B	that's the part we needed
A	yeah I need to send off passport

A	no
B	just
A	you need a passport
[ANNOTATION]	A passport is recommended, but not mandatory.	Contradiction
B	oh is it actually you've gotta send it off?

B	oh right
A	and postal order payment which we don't even know
B	for a postal order?

A	Uzbek doesn't actually say there
B	no I think it's
A	really?
[ANNOTATION]	You send it without your passport.	Contradiction
B	it's quite a lot
[ANNOTATION]	It will take no less than two weeks to get it here from Uzbek.	Neutral
A	is that a hotel or that's a hostel hostel is different is it?

A	and also hotels
B	not really
A	well erm well
B	okay
B	yeah but there's also one down here saying
A	so a hundred dollars?
[ANNOTATION]	English hostels are very warm an cozy.	Neutral
B	mm
A	what do they say is photo size? let's have a look
B	yeah
A	they'll fit on but have the that specific size that do prints yeah so has the photo printing
B	do you know how to change I don't know why it changed but it used to be like shift and three was pound but now I have to do alt and three and it changed it just changed randomly
A	I don't know and I have no idea how to get the hash key until ages ago
A	oh right
B	I forgot I forgot what it is now it's like control alt for hash yeah I just couldn't couldn't do it oh wrong one
B	yeah
A	that was do like if you press command and a number it takes you to that tab that's open
B	I was trying to find out cos I did something weird I think see it doesn't do it sometimes though
A	okay
B	oh maybe mine's different control? mm?
A	six by four that's the
A	got Paintbrush you do a width in pixels
B	I dunno
A	yeah Paintbrush
B	and it's like hidden
A	I just searched it and got it up
B	mm it's not it's not online
A	well like if you have you you used er
B	no oh
A	oh like we we can use photo can't photos
B	yeah you can do that I'm pretty sure but I was thinking about just doing it on Word
A	yeah
B	so and so you just copy and paste it and save it as a PDF and I'm pretty sure you can just print PDFs on the machines
A	mm I don't know a lot of the quality might deteriorate though
B	so you you want to have it as a JPEG?
A	pretty much yeah
B	can you do that in Word? saving it
A	no I don't think so
B	can you not save erm like on the loads of pictures together as an image and then save that as a picture?
A	mm I see what you mean
B	let's just try that
A	I think well I smashed it
B	yeah
B	nice
A	all different countries apparently
B	oh well ours is the same as that or slightly different?
A	I don't know
B	yeah there's not that much variation
A	no
B	okay let's do them and
A	I think you so you select your paper size so six by four if you print to Asda do you want a border? no select your image
B	so load a file that kind of one
A	there you go picture or image
A	it keeps the aspect for you and you just put it onto
B	looks pretty good
A	and finish lovely jubbly
B	yeah
A	then you cut very carefully
B	how much do you reckon it is for each one? you like like on the internet?
A	yeah we're talking pence I think
B	is it? although and
A	there you go
B	where did you get that? that's a bit quick
B	what?
A	I got it before

B	I would say it's taller than it is wide
B	that's pretty good
A	well let's try it go and see what it comes out as
B	yeah you got like a ruler?
B	it would be good if they put a little erm a gap in between them
A	there there is a slight gap but it's not fantastic
B	mm
A	it's square
B	yeah
A	oh I didn't mate
A	I didn't oh they refreshed the page
B	yeah
A	six by four inch what's this four out here?
B	now we've got all this shit round the edges now

B	yeah
A	it's that's six by four size
B	better be
A	yeah is that right though? you

A	which one?
B	than the other one
A	that one
B	yeah
A	there's less light the other side
B	I just uploaded it just as it was should I have cropped it and
A	I don't think so I think it'll be fine ah okay can we do this ratio thing?
A	right five five thirty divided by four fifteen
B	point two seven
A	that's yeah that's good so just don't know what what size paper all your prints will be on
A	we'll do right I'll make sure I do mine proper
B	mm yeah
A	right six by four inch that's what we want isn't it?
B	yep
A	that's for six

A	no they come up horizontal photos don't they? from the machine printed like your holiday snaps
B	okay
A	the overall size of it
B	yeah yeah
A	it's like that
B	oh so that I thought that was for each individual
A	oh no no
B	oh okay
A	so six six inches is
B	what shall I say is the start date?
A	to what?
B	I'm trying to find start
A	is it thirty day?
B	it isn't it's it's tourist so I say whenever
A	just put like five days before we enter
A	where do we enter Uzbek from?
B	Turkmenistan
A	okay
B	yeah we can do it erm
A	oh good spot on
B	but there's no passport collection facility in
A	yeah so we have to pay for it to be mailed back do we?
B	it's a tenner I think
A	sorry?
B	we're saving a tenner cos it's like a hundred and forty-five and it works out to a hundred and thirty-five
A	oh right okay so what how much is the visa? like ninety-five quid or something?
B	erm well it was like sixty about sixty-five and then the service fee of forty quid and the documents is twenty quid
A	but wait service fee to the embassy for doing the visa?
A	yeah
B	mm
B	purpose of visit what do we say? it says brackets in detail
A	in detail? cities we're gonna visit then
B	well I we've put our route of transiting through the territory
A	right
B	doing
A	to see the sights
A	I think we should do that
B	you think we should?
A	I don't think we'll be
B	well
A	we'll be transiting from from where to where
B	uhu
A	I don't think we'll hear any more than that
B	no yeah but tourist trip driving through Uzbekistan to see the sights oh the inviting party
A	inviting party?
B	then in brackets it says inviting organisation or person
A	oh yeah
B	er so we don't need to apply supply an address in
A	what what was the application for this one?
B	well it says address in Uzbekistan and there's a star next to it I don't reckon that star will matter
A	well we'll find out I guess when we try and get to the next page
B	yeah it says previous trips to Uzbekistan none accompanying persons I'll put your name and occupation students place of work like that's a university student work also the address
A	mm for what?
A	yeah
B	instead of leaving it blank
A	yeah
B	the fields address in Uzbekistan is empty erm in fact when we're travelling in
A	mm I think that's the view if
B	oh yeah okay we're gonna stay for three days to be honest
A	wow
A	erm Tripadvisor stuff here for erm she apply she applied three
A	erm no
B	uhu
A	as a tourist and she had no problems
B	so she just put a random hotel?
A	yeah
B	so shall we just put a random hotel then?

B	no
A	so so so
B	I'm hungry
A	hungry?
B	uhu
A	let's see what we've got
B	I'm starving don't like lying
A	it's not lying I suppose
B	it is
A	if we could we'd stay there

A	I'd put a proper hotel to be honest
B	well yeah well
A	is that bad?

A	does it look
B	looks alright yeah
A	yeah cool
B	shall I put a hotel for each city or just one hotel?
A	I think one hotel I suppose
B	just one?
A	if they query us like we'll just be like well don't need one so fuck off
B	what? I don't understand it says check up a format of the fill field address in Uzbekistan what's that?
A	perhaps you have a comma I don't know
B	strange that we've er like properly done stuff today we've not just watched a Seinfeld
A	oh yeah
A	the Iran?

A	travels in one pair? do they just not smell or something? what?
