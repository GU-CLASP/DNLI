B	right so what did you say?
A	well I sent I sent a text
B	yeah
A	sending all our love
B	mhm
A	no but she didn't get back yesterday either
B	no
B	weird pictures and stuff
A	yeah
B	and it had a picture of these two kids hugging each other
A	yeah
B	and it said if you ask me how I am and I say I'm fine
A	I'm not
B	it really means I need a hug
A	oh
B	and then loads of people
A	but that's all I want to do is go round there and
B	yeah
A	give her a big hug
B	yeah
A	mm it's a bit quick to come to terms with it
B	yeah
A	it's cos it's one of those things
B	mm
A	well some people do feel feel it and that's why they go and get tested
B	yeah
A	it just pops up
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	huh
A	it's like
B	yeah
A	and then they they told her she had some er
B	yeah
A	and that she's only got ten years
B	what?
A	yeah
B	how can people predict you've got ten years?
A	I don't know
B	that's a bit
A	I don't
B	I don't agree with that
A	no
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	once they're diagnosed then
B	right
A	generally they last about ten years
B	yeah but like when my brother was born they said um he's got one day
A	yeah they don't know for sure do they
B	what thirty-three years old
A	no
A	are they gonna tell
B	no
A	Cos
B	no
A	I hope they don't
B	no they can't tell him
A	Cos they do like to tell everybody what's happening
B	yeah
A	with them
B	I'll have to mention that to Dad actually
A	well when
B	Cos that'll set him off
A	yeah
B	hm
A	I just I
B	mm
A	just want to visit
B	yeah
A	and just give them a hug
B	yeah
A	I don't know take her a card
B	er
A	do you write a card or?
B	huh
A	well I don't mm well that's what she like
B	yeah
A	she loves cards
B	yeah okay
A	but what do you write?
B	I dunno
A	hope you get better soon
A	I mean that's not the kind of card is it
B	I don't know
A	thinking of you
B	that kind of thing
A	yeah
B	um
A	I was talking today with
B	mm
A	I mean they do
B	yeah
A	they are good
B	when's she gotta have her MRI
A	who's having an MRI scan?
A	no she's having a
B	yeah that's after
A	what is MRI?
B	well I dunno
A	I've forgotten
B	hm
A	I don't know
B	but I don't know if that was something to determine
A	I don't know what that is
B	no nor do I
A	yeah
B	but that's in two weeks
A	huh?
B	that's in two weeks' time
A	mm
B	which I don't know how critical it is in getting something
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean I'd hate to be sitting around for two weeks if I'd just been diagnosed with that
A	well wait what else can you do? That's what you've got to do
B	well yeah but
A	you've got to wait
B	if it was private you'd get it done the next day wouldn't you?
A	yeah I was talking to
B	yeah
A	so you literally just have to get um you have to get the the check done
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	er
A	so I was thinking that for some other people as well
B	mm
A	just to get the check out
B	mm
A	and then get your consultancy papers and everything
B	mm
A	every diagnosis that you've got
B	mm
A	there's no point in doing everything through private healthcare because they just
B	no
A	send you through the NHS anyway
B	yeah
A	you just have to pay
B	that's the biggest thing
A	yeah
B	it's getting something done the next week or getting something done in three years' time
A	I was wondering as well you said that they've spent all their money
B	who? What my dad?
A	mm
B	well no they've spent a big part of it
A	whereas
A	now I bet they wish they had the money
B	well yeah
A	well I'm sure they've got some left
B	well he's always been a bit foolish with money really
A	well I think it it should be alright now they've got they've got some
B	yeah
A	to spend
B	yeah
A	oh well
B	yeah um we're I was talking earlier with your mum and dad about the you know that um inoculation they give the thirteen-year-old girls
A	mm
B	that's
A	what's that all about?
B	I thought that was about cervical
A	it is
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but then your mum said it was something to do with Chlamydia
A	no it's not
B	can Chlamydia
A	it's not to do with
B	contribute
A	chlamydia
B	to having cervical cancer?
A	I don't know but I I'm pretty sure it's the cervical cancer jab
B	right
A	that's I don't know what it does
B	well no
A	I don't get it
B	that's a load of bollocks isn't it really?
A	I don't understand it at all
B	it's just a multi-billion pound pharmaceutical
A	mm
B	er push
A	infertility
B	infertility
A	but that's what scares me about
B	evil bastards
A	going getting any test
B	mm
A	done
B	mm
A	messing about with anything
B	yeah well I was reading that thing about all the heavy metals they put in the injections
A	mm
B	and I'm sure that is linked to autism
A	well they say er well
B	Cos that's just gone through the roof
A	on the TV the other day they were saying about the asthma and the eczema rates
B	yeah
A	skyrocketing
B	mm
A	and then they were trying to find all these different excuses as to why but nobody really said anything about these multiple jabs they're giving the babies
B	yeah
A	they're giving them the flu jab and that um um oh the that trio
B	that's MMR not MRI
A	oh
B	yeah
A	giving it to the little babies
B	no
A	I just hope we don't get to the condition like America is and we all get put in prison for neglect if we don't have our babies have jabs
B	yeah
A	that woman in America got
B	well they've
A	done
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	they've literally taken kids off their parents
A	yeah I know
B	well it should be
A	they can't say
B	I dunno
A	no proof that it's it's definitely the right thing to do
B	no
A	yeah
B	things
A	yeah
B	there's no debating that
A	yeah
B	by these companies who are
A	mm
B	and just generating as much money as they can
A	mm
B	ethics takes a backseat really doesn't it
A	mm
B	and the amount of um I dunno experiments they've done through the history
A	yeah
B	and find the amount of times that
A	they've
B	on us
A	yeah
B	well that's yeah that's rumours
A	mm
B	clinically tested
A	but you never know
B	and proven where people have got millions in compensation and stuff
A	mm
B	but they're just all hidden and then anyone who talks about it is a conspiracy theorist or
A	yeah
B	you know it's and to think that that kind of stuff isn't happening now is just it's foolish I think
A	yeah but it's just difficult to know what they're doing it on or what what ones are safe
B	yeah
A	yeah but like you said there are the good ones that stop you getting ill
B	yeah
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	um but I had German measles when I was a kid
B	I don't know
A	can get lots of times
B	hm
A	er you have to research it really so that you know what you're so you know what you're looking at
B	yeah
A	that's
B	mm
A	and if I had it when I was a kid then I can't get it again
B	mm
A	immunize myself
B	mm
A	as far as I know
B	well it's like with these flu jabs as well they push on the old people
A	mm
B	every Christmas
A	yeah
B	I'm sure that kills
B	yeah
A	um
B	do you know what I dunno er I suppose it's personal choice isn't it?
A	well as long as it stays a personal choice
B	yeah
A	then you can
B	exactly
B	India without having a single jab
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	again
B	yeah
A	now that that doctor in Thailand always
B	he
A	told me
B	yeah
A	Cos that
B	mm
A	just went to get them
B	mm
A	I said well what's
B	well that's it
A	Cos we do
B	normal isn't it
A	yeah
A	just in case I
B	it's like what people do
A	I'm outside and I cut myself
B	yeah
A	with a stick
B	A rusty nail
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	tetanus? And I think no
B	I mean sorry
A	and then
B	then you just go along with the the social norm
A	I can't remember the percentage he said but it was really low
B	yeah
A	and and then he said and then like if you do cut yourself with your rusty nail outside or something then you can go and get your tetanus jab
B	mm
A	just as a precaution
B	yeah
A	but what's the point of having it if you haven't?
B	yeah
A	got any infection to begin with
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	hm
A	but I kind of I like that different side of a doctor giving me a different opinion
B	no
A	they just go you need this
B	well I mean
A	stronger
B	they're all drug peddlers
A	mm
A	I know
B	I think you know more
A	even the opticians
B	yeah the opticians as well
A	like they
B	yeah
A	they were  they were  saying to me I
B	mm
A	and then I don't trust them
B	mm
A	it's like you're not listening to what I'm saying
B	mm
A	I'm telling you that my eyesight is worse in one part than the other part
B	or you should at least be interested
A	yes
B	in that you're saying that
A	yeah
B	not just going through her
A	like oh I've never heard that before
B	yeah
A	and look it up and
B	yeah
A	and yeah they should be interested
B	yeah
A	they just
B	they do that and then that's they've got no
A	they just wanna give me stronger and stronger glasses
B	complete
A	I said what if I do my eye exercises
B	they don't work
A	can't improve your
B	no
A	eyesight
B	yeah
A	and he can see almost twenty twenty vision
A	and they said that it's a an effect because
B	not enough
A	he never had enough oxygen
B	yeah
A	going in
B	hm
A	to his brain
B	hm
A	and ages and then when they took it away and he's been feeling better
B	mm
A	and his eyesight I mean they said he was like Spiderman
A	he put on his glasses and he couldn't see
A	it was all blurry
A	was like Spiderman suddenly getting his special powers and
B	did he start climbing the walls?
A	but that goes to show that there is something that you can do to improve your
B	well yeah there's a lot
A	health and your you know
B	beneath the surface
A	that the doctors don't know about
B	that the doctors can't see or we don't know about yet
A	yeah
B	I dunno
A	mm
B	I think that's dangerous really
A	I know but it takes a lot to research it
B	yeah it does but
A	that's like these cures
B	that's what people should do I think
A	with Trish like I'd love to say to her oh I've researched this and this
B	yeah
A	um but I don't think people listen to be honest you know
B	no no they don't to be honest
A	I but you should tell them
B	because they don't like it puts them in a position where they they they lose power
A	their beliefs
B	they've got a world view
A	mm
B	if they start questioning that then they they lose their empowerment
A	yeah
B	um to which there usually there isn't an answer anyway
A	yeah
B	but I dunno
A	yeah
B	hm
A	yeah
B	hm
A	you know what I believe in all of these acupressure things and stuff
B	mm
A	but not many other people
B	mm
A	there is
B	yeah
A	and the meditation thing you see
B	no
A	or any
B	no
A	no
B	so there's no point pushing it on people
A	a self belief
B	ah critical thinking
A	what?
B	um
A	mm
B	people don't want to go out and learn how to criticize things to get a a different perspective
A	no
B	in fact they're actively encouraged not to do that
A	they yeah they just want
B	whatever
A	somebody who's who's specialized in that area to tell them what's best
B	yeah
A	for them
B	yeah
A	not to like
B	but the trouble is
A	not to think for themselves
B	when these experts um
A	if they get it right
B	get in positions of extreme power like
A	mm
B	er what's happened now
A	well you can't say that about all of them
B	no
A	mm
B	but that's I think one of the fundamental problems in our society at the moment
A	well you um baby
B	mm
B	yeah well if a doctor tells you your baby needs a jab
A	it's almost like they sell it
B	you do it don't you?
A	I don't think they just tell you
B	mm
A	yeah
B	hm
A	and then people say well you know it's it's free treatment and everybody else says that it's good so we should do it
B	yeah
A	it would be very different if you had to pay for it I'm sure
B	hm
A	I saw a bit of that
B	you saw some of it did you?
A	A little tiny bit
B	it was quite good
A	mm
B	you could imagine them just sitting in their you know their
A	who are they? What?
B	the Barclays brothers
A	oh Barclays
A	yeah
B	going ha ha how can we fuck them over? you know
A	yeah
A	in his mansion
B	yeah
A	really?
B	is amazing
A	they own the whole island
B	yeah
A	weird isn't it?
B	just er the power you know
A	mm
B	it is it's frightening
A	yeah
B	these people have got such an influence
A	yeah
B	and to remove themselves from society themselves shows their kinda
A	or they just need to try and hide away cos otherwise everybody would just get them
A	mm
B	evil bastards
A	that thing that was on the TV this morning that was a bit weird about Barclays having to it's not just Barclays having to pay back all of those insurance things
B	right
A	but I don't really understand that
A	why are they why are the banks? I mean I know it's kind of good that the banks will
B	yeah
A	pay back ordinary people who got tricked into things
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but I'm sorry you
B	but
A	shouldn't be so silly as to
B	yeah
A	buy something and not read the contract
B	yeah I
A	a real trick
B	I don't know about this either
A	if it was a good trick
B	I haven't really read about that
A	I mean that's it is good they're giving money back
B	yeah
A	and they're gonna go through it one by one
B	yeah
A	they've been told to go through it one by one and pay people back money
B	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	because of the financial er what's the word? Climate
A	mm
B	they use don't they
A	yeah
B	oh okay well we're giving back to the people
A	mm
B	you know
A	yeah but it's all so like then that factory that they're opening up um Nissan
B	Nissan?
A	going yeah it's a
B	Don't know
A	oh I don't know
A	hopefully it will be local people
B	right
A	but they think it's gonna be abroad
B	yeah
A	hang on a minute
B	mm
A	back to England
B	well that's surprising though
A	let's bring back all the jobs
B	hm
A	no but then like it was like a huge
B	yeah
B	I mean the parts will made in
A	like coughing
B	China but usually the assembly is done in the er to do
A	but they
B	assembly would be expensive in England
A	I don't know
B	mm
A	it seemed like
B	yeah I know what you mean
A	it seemed like another story to make people happy
B	yeah
A	mm?
B	I mean well we haven't watched the news in what? Pff
A	I watch the news every day
B	well we watch it
A	I flick through all those different channels
B	well since we've been back we have
A	we yeah but you
B	do you know what I mean? I have to completely remove
A	er
B	myself from watching it
A	and just research on the internet
B	and just kind of analyze it as you watch it
A	no
B	well you can't though
A	mm
B	on the internet is the best thing
A	I was trying to flick through all the different channels and like look at RT and then at
B	yeah well that's a good start
A	fRANCE 24 and
B	get a good cross-section
A	I like the Euronews
B	Al Jazeera
A	programme
B	yeah
A	the breakfast programme I mean
B	yeah
A	Euronews Breakfast
B	yeah I like RT
A	I don't know
B	although they're extremely biased
A	I like RT
B	obviously
A	but I don't like
B	but
A	exactly
B	but they say things er that no other news
A	yeah that's true
B	that's why I like them
A	mm
B	they're not  they're not  scared of saying it
B	even Al Jazeera is completely you know western orientated really
A	yeah
B	even though it shows images that are quite gory
A	yeah
B	but when you look a lot of their stories
A	it's not
B	it isn't
A	no
B	yeah
A	the Tunisians were really upset
B	yeah
A	with them
B	yeah
A	the Al Jazeera TV
B	no
A	why they thought  they thought
B	no they're in bed with the western media
A	they'd be on their side
B	hm
A	no
B	hm
A	yeah?
A	what on?
B	I'm getting desperate for money
A	no they just play bingo
A	mm
B	and it showed me a load of adverts

B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agrees with Person B that doing Vodafone is discussing	Neutral
A	yeah
B	Cos though er
A	yeah
B	who
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah

A	I know it's sad isn't it
B	is oh I I just find it sickening
A	yeah
B	how did she know
A	yeah she's like looking at little
B	I mean everyone knows Yoda
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	yeah looking at Yoda
B	yeah
A	as if he's a normal person
B	yeah
A	how did he do
B	I dunno it just irritates me
A	yeah
B	that kind of stuff
A	I think they pitched that all wrong
B	all wrong man
A	completely
[ANNOTATION]	Person A believe that they are all wrong	Entailment
B	I can see half the country
A	I don't know who that
B	screaming at that advert
A	yeah
B	going oh you fucking leave Yoda alone
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	he's one of the coolest people
A	yeah but they must have bought the rights to Yoda or something
B	yeah they
A	mustn't they?
B	must have spent millions on that
A	they must have bought the
B	yeah
A	to have Yoda on there
B	I reckon they're trying to change their image
A	Don't know
B	I reckon they're trying to make themselves look cool
B	um
A	are they German company?
B	Vodafone
A	I don't  I don't  know
B	oh no that's Ericsson that's
A	I don't know actually
B	Vodafone
A	maybe they are American
B	er no I don't know
A	mm
B	stupid bastards anyway aren't they?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I keep getting sucked into it
B	oh
A	Don't know
B	yeah
A	of all those chat shows and stuff
B	yeah well that's the new trend isn't it?
A	I really had trouble watching the TV when we first came back
B	mm
A	and I don't know what it is
B	it sucks you in doesn't it?
A	it like my habit of like in the evening started watching TV and
B	yeah
A	like we didn't even have a TV before so it's I don't know why this is a new habit of ours
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	yeah but these yeah these flashing graphics which are the trend like like I said before I think it's the the HDTV
A	yeah
B	that they're just trying to brighten everything
A	but it's not oo it's it's
B	well it's not
A	mm
B	it's
A	mm
B	and even like these chat shows
A	yeah
B	they're just moving
A	they always seem to be blue
B	and they're all slowly moving and morphing and changing shape
A	I wonder if it's like some sort of hypnosis thing
A	no seriously
B	maybe it is
A	well there was  there was  this one programme they really
B	yeah
A	er the banker
B	yeah he's got it as well
A	but he's got
B	everyone's got it
A	a round like a a round and it really is like a hypnosis thing
B	yeah
A	and you're thinking oh dear Max you're resorting to hypnosis for people to
A	listen to you or something
B	yeah
A	so I well
B	but TV doesn't even have to do that because
A	but it is hypnotic
B	because TV um it was it alpha
A	mm?
B	alpha
A	oh
B	it puts your brain into a state
A	er
B	that you're in
A	beta I thought
B	when you're sleeping
A	yeah
B	is it beta?
A	or theta theta
B	I can't remember
A	alpha is awake
B	right
A	it's either beta or theta
B	same when you are dreaming
A	yeah
B	which makes you more suggestible
A	mhm
B	mm
A	yeah and that's what I think all these
B	are just trying to
A	they're just trying to enhance it
B	I dunno
A	yeah
B	I'm not sure about that
A	well I wish they'd get rid of it
B	mm
A	mind you I shouldn't be watching TV anyway
B	yeah well huh you know we're staying round someone else's house effectively and you fit into
A	well I know but
B	their routines don't you?
A	no but I feel like I should be up doing stuff but
B	yeah but if you're up doing stuff in the time that they sit down to watch TV
A	well that's um
B	then you're being rude
A	oh
B	because you're not spending time with them
A	mm
B	that's the problem
A	yeah well
B	isn't it?
A	do you want another drink?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	can I have a pint of er John Smith's please?
A	yeah
B	I'll turn that off
