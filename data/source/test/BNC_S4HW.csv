A	I've got all different books
B	he didn't bring any books with him
A	why don't you read that one that mum started? that erm what's it called mum? the Busby one
B	yeah that's
A	what's?
B	a bit distressing
A	yeah but he's he's alright
B	me?
A	yeah
B	well the dad's just been shot and the police have come and then the guy's got into their house and they've been hiding in the loft
A	right I read it years ago I can't remember the details but you've brought two books you've brought that one and the
C	yeah
A	in mum's brown leather handbag down
B	you'll always find oh wait
A	yeah downstairs
C	mm
A	there's my erm Kindle
C	right
A	and that's got a couple of different books on it's not got many on cos I've not used to
C	yeah I know I should have brought them actually
A	what are they? what did she get you? it was
B	Mockingjay
A	is it The Hunger Games
B	yeah
A	trilogy?
B	it's meant to be
A	pardon? it's meant to be I know it's uncomfortable though
B	good
A	do you not think so?
D	yeah
B	tonight? I'm not sure
A	don't think I am I think I'm gonna wait till a hot day
C	yeah?
B	you said you were treating yourself
C	I know but I didn't go cos I figured I didn't wanna buy it because in two weeks the price might have gone down I know
A	what game?
C	I want Uncharted it's called it's the final one
A	why would the price have gone down in two weeks?
C	don't know because sometimes like a couple of weeks after release you can get it for like twenty quid cheaper on Ebay and that's what I was just looking then
B	you're such a skinflint
A	skinflint I suppose he wouldn't have used it these two weeks would he? so
C	no exactly that's what I thought and then there's one called Overwatch which is made by the same people who make World of Warcraft so
A	I've told you we'll get you back to Tesco's
C	yeah I don't know I might just spend
A	you can do loads over the summer and then the minimum contract they'll give you a week is seven hours
C	yeah
A	so you can do either do all either do seven hours at once on a Saturday or do two evenings three and a half hours
B	he's still gotta you've gotta fill that form in and get to beyond
A	yeah yeah
B	haven't you?
A	oh is this ready?
C	oh oh right have you put some like sundried tomatoes on?
B	yeah
C	can I not have the sundried tomatoes please?
B	okay
D	thank you
A	so you could just get a contract for seven hours if they're giving any
C	yeah
A	and then do loads of overtime over the summer and then just in September when you go to college just drop down to two evenings a week or something
C	yeah
A	it's up to you
B	well I think he'd be better
C	how?
A	sorry?
B	he's gonna have to do some voluntary work
A	what for?
B	ready for medical school
A	yeah but over the summer he's gonna have loads of free time
B	yeah
A	you know like if you're on a three and a half hour contract you can ask for overtime to work three and a half hours before so you're not going in for an extra day you're just working a longer shift
C	mm
A	you get time and a half for Sunday so Sundays are good to work really cos you get over ten pound an hour
C	ten pound an hour that's not bad if I worked like seven hours a week that's like seventy quid a week innit?
A	well they'd give you they might it's whether they give you contract hours on a Sunday but you could always take overtime there's always overtime
C	the only difficulty thing is I go on holiday so if like two weeks after I get back I go on holiday don't I with
A	yeah only for a week though
B	they'd set you up for an induction day anyway
A	it takes we'll
B	what would I be doing? would I
A	on tills or putting on like fresh food putting stuff out
B	be better on tills
A	tills well tills is boring though cos you're just sat there
C	no
A	doing nothing

A	at least you can talk to people
C	no I'd rather be tills me
B	would you?
C	yeah
B	you'd be chit-chatting

C	so
B	yeah
C	loads of the students didn't wanna go cos
B	mm
C	er it was also lots of protests went on like African American protests were were big and the second big one was students and at Kent State University I can't remember where in the US it is but erm
A	Pennsylvania
C	in Pennsylvania?
A	Penn State yeah
C	no Kent State
A	Kent?
C	yeah
A	oh
C	erm there's a there was a protest about I think it was Johnson extending bombings in Cambodia and
B	mm
C	and erm National Guards opened fire and killed like five students and injured like eleven others
B	because they were protesting?
C	basically yeah they got startled and just shot them and killed them there and that was like one of the like after that that was like that started not started but was a important factor in the public basically going against the war
B	how do you know that?
C	history
B	who?
C	the Tet offensive
B	no
D	I'll do it now yeah
C	yeah basically new year holiday in Vietnam
A	did you want tea mum?
B	yes please what? I'm listening
C	new year holiday in Vietnam
B	yeah
C	erm the Americans had given all their soldiers er some of the South Vietnamese
A	got about four decaf left
B	it's alright so if you do one in two go on I'm listening
C	erm and basically the Viet Cong launched a massive offensive and the USA didn't expect it and they lost loads and loads of ground and even though a couple of days later they won it back that was like the deciding factor that turned everyone against the Vietnam war and there was this CBS reporter called Walter
B	he thought it was?
C	unwinnable cos the before before the Vietnam war the USA had never won a war they'd always been used to going in quick and then and making a profit from it basically cos you know World War
A	World War Two they made a fortune
C	yeah they made an absolute fortune
B	did they?
C	on World War Two
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	they sold arms to everyone
C	stole they stole the trade routes and then
A	I don't think this is fridge is very cold
C	erm
A	gonna turn it up a bit do you think the higher the number the colder it is?
B	yeah yeah and then how come they sided with us then?
C	sorry?
A	in World War Two?
B	yeah
A	they only very late on
C	yeah
A	they only joined in very late on before that they were just selling to everybody
C	yeah
A	and making a fortune from it
B	but then they had the great depression didn't they?
A	no the Second World War
B	yeah
A	that's what really
B	I mean in the fifties they had the great depression didn't they?
C	yeah the Wall Street crash
B	so but what happened when they had the Wall Street crash?
A	the Wall Street crash
D	that that was in the thirties
B	yeah but why?
C	because I dunno about this too actually sorry but this is all my history basically like it was similar to our situation basically banks had
A	do you want
C	banks were lending to people who couldn't really afford it
D	yeah but the Wall Street crash was in the thirties not the fifties
C	yeah
B	well there was a big depression in the fifties
C	yeah and and it was World War Two that brought them out of the depression
A	there wasn't a I don't think there was a depression in the fifties it was the twenties mum
C	yeah
B	was it?
A	yeah it was the twenties and then the Wall Street crash happened in the thirties oh no the booming twenties
C	booming twenties crash
A	crash in the thirties
C	depression
A	and then the world war
C	so they got out of it for World War Two
A	helped improve things for them
C	yeah
B	take that off
C	and invested money they didn't really have I mean people were setting up like the demand was so big that people were setting up like they were called ghost companies they were just fake companies and people were still buying shares in them
B	gosh
A	well the same thing that happened in the thirties happened in two thousand and
B	I can't well
A	well it's like I think in London it'll have to crash at some point because house prices can't continue to go up
B	well that's what
A	yeah cos something's gonna happen
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	she'll be extremely out of pocket if it crashes you know what I mean? it's like serious money like
B	well I think she'll be okay she's not got a huge mortgage
A	she'd do she'd be quids in to sell now
B	yeah
A	cos she's owned it for what? twenty odd years
B	no no she's got an eleven she's got a bit of a mortgage whacked on it
C	how much?
B	I can't remember what she said
C	well that home's worth what? eight hundred grand did you say?
B	oh no it's millions
C	really?
A	their house is worth a million?
B	yeah
A	bloody
B	she's not really is she?
C	it's just London innit?

A	is
C	no

A	are you okay mum?
B	fine watching the sunset
C	I don't I don't wanna be mean but I just I don't know er Btec like Btec er Btec
B	well
C	do you know what I mean? cos it's like it's a bit of a joke if like it's you know it's seen as a bit of a joke isn't it like basically it is anyway at
B	do you have to go to university to be a midwife? no probably not really
A	except you do now
B	well you do but I'm saying do you need to? too many people have gone to university
A	yeah that's what I mean now it it mean
B	so
A	it means a lot less now than it meant when you guys
B	so
C	no absolutely I'm saying there's some fantastic Btecs out there like I know BA do a great one where they they take you on after A levels and you get a degree while you're working and they
A	like as an engineer?
C	yeah as an engineer for BA
A	yeah
B	quite hard to
A	if you could get an apprenticeship like they are very competitive if you could get something like that where they're gonna pay for your degree and pay
C	absolutely yeah
A	you at the same time
B	you might as well do it
A	you're quids in you may as well do it
B	absolutely
A	don't have experience yeah the if they had experience of studying but no actual work experience
B	like communication skills and
A	which is why like you know dad having a degree would have been enough to get him a job coming out of uni but now it's not you have to have work experience as well and all sorts of extra things
C	yeah
A	cos it's not enough
B	does this affect us
C	what?
B	is this like the end of
C	it's not really
B	is it quarter finals after this?
C	yeah
A	so what happens after this? the top two from each board goes through?
C	yeah and plays the so first we'll play first of another group I can't remember which we played
A	sorry say that again
C	so the third
A	so so England will play the first of another group?
C	yeah which will probably be I dunno I think it's like Portugal's group that we play against and then the second'll play against the second of that group then the first of another group will play against the first of another group
A	right and then what?
C	and then they get smaller and smaller and smaller until it's the final
A	but what about why do the first of each group play the first of another group instead of the second?
C	it's just the way it works
A	but then how do they decide then? does does the winner of the two the two seconds playing each other play a first? or do you know what I mean?
C	yeah it's a bit complex cos er it gets
B	did you share one tea bag between these?
A	yeah looked alright we've only got three three of those left
B	I'm sure we can get some decaf from
A	yeah
B	those shops where
