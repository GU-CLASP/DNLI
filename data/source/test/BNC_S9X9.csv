A	okay so who and who's playing er Madame
B	er
A	the main actress?
B	now
A	oh did she?
B	as as well
A	right
B	er I think that's the thing that's the thing that they were
A	mm
B	equal equal size really
A	oh that's the thing
B	er that was the difference between that and the film
A	mm
B	and erm
A	ah yeah
B	er American
A	that's a name I really can't remember
B	I can't remember either
A	mm
B	so it's just

A	mm well she turns out to be
B	yeah she is isn't she?
A	yeah from Who Do You Think You Are
B	yeah yeah she is she is a
A	by some reprobate
B	mm
A	mm
B	and
A	oh no there's only one
B	and
A	mm
B	er
A	oh right
B	so we don't know we don't know what happened that time
A	alright
B	so
A	oh
B	well
A	well I had a similar thing my great grandmother ran off
B	mm
A	and run off with somebody who was ten years her junior
B	mm
A	and er they er then had another family and she had another four children
B	mm
A	well she
B	oh wow wow
A	and only died
B	mm
A	to er have met or known her actually
B	mm mm
A	but erm
B	mm
A	because erm
B	right
A	well no cos
B	yeah
A	from her first husband
B	mm
A	even in the year where she was born there's forty or fifty women born in that same year with that exactly the same name
B	yeah
A	and erm we didn't know the name of the man she'd run off with so erm so it all sounded a bit impossible until such time as erm one day she just popped up on a
B	wow wow gosh yeah
A	mm so and then which was divorce record
B	right
A	so somebody some labour in somewhere some
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	no one knows anything about my mother's family
A	mm
B	and I was trying to track down some friends who live
A	mm
B	same place scenarios as
A	oh right
B	and
A	mm
B	in trying to track down the the other people
A	oh right
B	er and
A	alright okay
B	so she's only half an hour's drive away
A	mm
B	and she
A	mm
B	her father's name and
A	mm
B	mother's mother
A	mm
B	and erm mother's grandfather
A	right
B	because
A	no
B	it seemed to me
A	right
B	I mean I didn't know but as soon as she
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	er
A	yeah
B	as as my mother always has
A	mm
B	erm
A	what did she do?
B	she was a teacher
A	aha
B	a teacher she she taught
A	oh
B	or erm
B	oh
A	thank you
B	thank you erm and er
A	oh dear
B	yeah
A	mm
B	erm
A	right
B	anyway long story short
A	was she very was she brought up in a
B	er well
A	but
B	I think it was all pretence because
A	yeah
B	I found her grandfather was a coal miner
A	oh really?
B	er and
A	oh yes
B	er since twelve by charge of
A	mm
B	erm
A	oh
B	so he had a whole lot of er individuals erm
A	what the
B	yeah
B	mm
A	oh
A	he could've been
B	he he could've done
A	I guess so
B	he possibly did and
A	like the American
B	mm he could've done
A	oh but the
B	erm
A	right yes definitely and then yes it just came in the door
B	erm that's right that's right so
A	mm
B	but it will explain why mother was a bit
A	mm
B	feeling a bit
A	mm
B	er about her er grandfather being a coal miner
A	mm
B	and
A	what year was your mother born?
B	say again
A	what year was your mother born?
B	nineteen thirteen
A	oh okay
B	and
A	my my granny's born in nineteen 0 three and erm you would
B	yeah
A	she really wasn't
B	wasn't she? wasn't she?
A	no
A	oh it's well there's more than a no I mean I I
B	yeah
A	and erm
B	mm
A	erm my grandmother's father was a chauffeur in a stately home erm and actually worked in Buckinghamshire when I when
B	mm
A	where erm erm which
B	mm mm
A	and erm so erm
B	mm mm
A	that would
B	mm
A	erm is full of ladies who
B	yeah
A	but really who was who was most refined and most gentile out of everybody
A	and erm
B	yes
A	and and it was really quite sad I think
B	yeah yeah
A	so erm
B	yes
A	you were allowed to have a shop but
B	yes yes and the nuances which I
A	yes
B	rumbling
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	erm
A	well at least two three possibly yes run off barmaid pink blouses I er pink blouses were
A	yeah
B	cos my mother's quite a heavy drinker so she
B	erm that's that's right anyway went off with this barmaid er who wore pink blouses
A	yes
B	and erm it produced children and she said you know like
A	yes
B	and
A	yes
B	why that was important
A	actually also got together with somebody who used to be a barmaid his name is
B	uh even better
A	yes
B	mm
A	so my grandmother could barely say the word
A	so my my poor grandfather was sort of terribly you know sort of brought down by the world by this feeling so my nan I think probably spent a great deal of time trying to disguise all of this stuff
B	mm
A	and hide it from everybody
B	mm mm whereas now
A	well people go and
B	is is he is he
A	or do you do you think allowing that you know you know to have marriages and all sorts of things in their past people went to jail
B	yes yes and nobody
A	no
B	or anything but it was
A	yes
A	mm
B	went off with erm
A	so I think that yes it is erm things have changed
B	oh it's much better when other people say
A	mm
B	erm
A	mm
B	er are not nearly so
A	yeah
B	so much more healthy
A	oh
A	this is supposed to be a quiet environment not as
B	mm
A	who knows erm so erm
B	yes he was
A	but he
B	yes he
A	but but that was
B	yeah he was he was a lecturer
A	ah
B	erm a university
A	how many were in Sudan as a child was that cos he was teaching then?
B	that's right there was in Khartoum there was a university college
A	mm
B	er I
A	right
B	I read it somewhere
A	oh
B	and
A	mm
B	and er
A	mm
B	er
A	yeah
B	erm
A	right
B	I don't know
A	oh right I suppose they must've gone away for a new start or something you know
B	erm
A	sort of get away from
B	well the thing
A	yes
B	and being being fairly young
A	yes
B	and
A	yeah
B	and
A	ah
B	and
A	it's funny about all those facts isn't it? because you know there're sort of bits where
A	you know they lived in a place which where the houses were turned into military for training so
B	yeah
A	so you know perhaps he went there on training while her husband was away we just don't know that's that's another story that my great grandfather chased them through the station of the
A	and then he just stopped them leaving and that nobody knows if that's true or not because it's just it is just part of a story and nobody remembers where they heard that
B	mm
A	and whether that was factual or whether that was a supposition or
B	mm
A	whether they imagined that that would
B	yeah of course that's a wonderful erm
A	yeah
A	no and also
B	and
A	yeah how do you
B	mm
B	aha
A	and the judge awarded him compensation because he'd lost his wife this man had stolen his wife and erm and so and it took them many years to be able to afford to pay it back but they did actually pay back this sum of money in the end
B	right
A	which was erm
B	gosh
A	well I don't know I mean I suppose you were that you were legally entitled
B	wow wow yes
A	mm
B	yes think that's that's erm
A	yeah do you want to erm
B	yes
B	yes
A	and go outside past this hoover mind you
A	the hoover'll probably be a bit inaudible for a bit but you're supposed to do it all in one go so you're not supposed to sort of stop and start again
B	I see
A	that's the oh look at this
B	I see right
A	oh
B	so can I make a pig of myself and?
A	yes go on
B	you you don't want to make a pig of yourself?
A	no because I'm supposed to be on a diet
B	oh
A	yes
B	mm
A	and erm but you know when you go out it's a treat so I'm not I'm not being on a diet when I'm out with people because that's just too boring and grim and I know I'd feel mutinous and I'd feel
B	mm well I'm on a
A	ah well there so you'll have
B	so so
A	you'll have stomach cramps tomorrow now
B	so there there you are
B	oh well just eating clotted cream
B	with a spoon
A	with a spoon
B	oh yes so yes
A	out of a bowl
B	which is er
A	you get the maximum value out of our
B	oh yes oh yes yes
A	so let's erm so we have to run past the hoover now and see if we can sit outside for
B	mm
A	few minutes
A	thank you
B	bye bye mm
A	so
unknown_female	thank you
A	thank you
B	thank you
unknown_female	bye
A	do you think?
B	oh yes
A	whose bench is this? can we sit here do you think? can we sit here for a minute? is that alright?
unknown_female	yeah
A	thank you mm
B	that's good
A	looks as if it belongs to the next door neighbours doesn't it?
B	it
A	yes
B	mm
A	so oops
B	yeah so mother had
A	mm
B	erm
A	yeah
B	is acquiesce terribly pompous? erm
A	no it has a specific meaning
B	yes you
A	yes you sort of give in to pressure
B	yeah
A	if you agree er we er we agree to go on holiday together to Ibiza but erm if you acquiesce to go to Ibiza it suggests that actually you would've wanted to go somewhere else
B	yeah yeah okay acquiesce
A	and you're going to Ibiza to
B	yes right okay er no that's that's what I think but I keep on
B	you're sitting there saying yes but er
A	well
A	there are words for things and the English language is a fantastically rich language so you know and it does have more it has more words than French by a long way and so it has got nuances in words
B	well it it it does but
A	ah well this is one of the aims of this project is to work out the differences between how young people speak and how older
B	oh is it?
A	so one of the sort of things that they said to me in an e-mail was you know we're particularly interested if you can get young people to do recordings
B	right
A	so I'm gonna go off and talk to my nephews
B	yeah no that's interesting
A	at the weekend
B	that that that really is interesting cos er
A	if I can get them to sit still for an hour that'd be a miracle cos they don't do anything for an hour
A	they're just they
A	everything is on the double really with them they can't listen to a whole piece of music
B	yeah
A	erm they've got to fast forward it
B	oh
A	I don't
B	yeah and how did you get involved in this project?
A	because a friend of mine
B	oh yeah?
A	to do an
B	yeah
A	so I erm so I thought oh this is really interesting and I was er just about to apply for the job when I saw that there was an exhibition in
B	yes
A	I must go to this exhibition and erm there was a sale there as well erm so erm we
A	all in candy coloured rainwear
A	and with very sensible shoes and very sensible hair
A	who were behaving like a giant flock of starlings they were just landing on everything squabbling elbowing er
B	yeah?
A	I am quite interested in quilting but there is no way that I am going to associate
A	with erm these people for the next three years because er I mean
B	mm
A	I presume that these are the people that one will then be sent to interview
B	yes
A	so that's erm
B	yes
A	that was all a bit of a disappointment really
B	wow
A	but I'm very much into oral history anyway cos erm one of the things one of the historians that I very much
A	oh
A	I don't know erm
B	Studs Terkel why have I heard of
A	he
B	aha
A	so erm so one of erm when I was I think
B	oh yes
A	and as I told you earlier my university lecturers were all ex Oxford and Cambridge and they were all looking at how you learned and taught history in a different way
B	yeah
A	and therefore erm you know that that was a kind of approach that would impress them history from time resources
B	yes yes yes I see
A	completely lost my train now
B	mm
A	oh yes we were talking about quilting and we were talking about oral history and how I got involved in this project that's how we got to here
B	yeah yeah yes yes yes through through through a friend
A	yes
B	yeah yeah that's that's brilliant
A	yes I'm going to go round and find people who there's there's various I'm supposed to be doing a bit of a history about the charity that I'm chair of at the moment so I'm gonna go round and have conversations with trustees and ex trustees because we're opening our building up for the open house weekend in September
B	mm
A	and I'm I'm going to be erm I'm going to be
B	yeah
A	we're right opposite the building of the
B	yes yes
A	oh it's called er
B	right
A	it's right in the middle of Brixton oh there's dance
B	yes oh the dance yes
A	yes
B	it's a good idea I
A	yes
B	cos I was away but erm
A	no that's alright
B	but er yeah
A	yes well if we sold I don't know how much people would be prepared to pay
B	mm
A	a tenner? fifteen quid?
B	yeah
A	mm and then we'll do
A	mm oh yeah that's a good idea
B	er yeah and then after that after that carry on carry on playing
A	yeah cos I actually made this massive
B	gosh
A	and erm and then so I was and then nobody would get up and dance my
B	yes
A	and start dancing round in that open space but everybody was already sitting in comfy chairs and eating with the lights on
B	yes
A	so I would've had to switch the lights off
B	yes
A	and just
B	yes
B	no no there wasn't there wasn't erm erm
A	yes oh you spoke to
B	er I
A	my friend
B	I did yes
A	she said oh that
B	didn't I?
A	no
B	oh that's right that's right I didn't that's well
A	she said I had to give him a lecture in the end and tell him that
A	yeah yeah let one in yeah
B	include include where we met
A	yes
B	in the definition of who I am
A	yes
B	erm
A	I know did you get on with her? because she's very musical and her kids are really musical as well
B	I did I did I did er yes yes and I was a bit of jealous cos they were all all better than me er
A	ah
B	and yes I did I did discover that
A	how do you know? not her singing necessarily
B	erm
A	but you're a singer aren't you? rather than
B	yes
A	an instrumentalist
B	yes I am
A	I only play silly things like bazooms
B	yes
A	it is not the kind of thing that you take to a party in case somebody asks you to play
B	that's right that's right and and er yes yes yes there was a
A	she's very nice I've known her for
B	and it's almost that I don't like to be defined
A	no
B	so I
B	and you know that's far more interesting than the boring old
A	yes
A	yes but
B	yeah
A	how senior you are yes I know and one comes round to the same
B	you understand?
A	debate over and over again
B	you're
A	different times
B	yes yes yes you understand I know that's that's that's erm
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah and it was
A	mm
B	cancer treatments
A	mm
B	and that's
A	really?
B	it was the first time for
A	mm
B	to erm
A	erm you got back into
A	singing cos I remember you saying
B	right
A	you just spent sorry how many weeks have you spent away at summer school now? or is it a week? was it
B	yeah three three weeks three weeks
A	three weeks?
B	three weeks yes
A	and
B	erm
A	alright at
A	uh
B	er
A	ah
B	in nineteen forty-six
A	ah the great
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and
A	but these
A	are these for singers for choirs? for choirs?
B	er they are for oh
A	oh fine
B	so there're there're
A	yeah
B	and as it happens
A	oh
A	aha alright
B	so these run consecutively
A	right
B	er
A	and you went to both
B	I went to both yes
A	mm
B	it's cos some of the people who tutor on one tutor on the other as well
A	right
B	and
A	ah
B	so there's a bit of a bit of an overlap
A	yes and so erm you enjoyed it
B	yes yes very much very much very much yes erm
A	and do you wish to do you erm prefer being in a choir or do you like being a soloist?
B	I prefer being a soloist
A	do you?
B	yes yes I
A	and what's your what is your favourite
B	oh
A	Arne A R N E
B	Arne A R N E
A	yeah
B	who's famous because he
A	I don't know
B	Rule Britannia
A	oh is he?
B	yup
A	oh right see I
B	yeah
A	huge gap see I'm with I'm like music like you are with literature
A	well not quite actually not quite as bad I'm just not
B	well I have admitted to reading George Orwell and
A	yes
B	that's literature P.G
A	yes
B	well
A	I think that's
B	right right
A	okay classics I suppose classics with a capital C obviously would be sort of a big set of pieces I guess
B	yes yes
A	and erm with a small C is just anything that is now deemed to be
B	right right
A	such as for example a few years ago in the Guardian or the Observer I can't remember which said these are the top hundred novels of all times and you really have got to read these novels
B	oh yes
A	so I thought well and I cut it out
B	I do remember that
A	and I discarded the children's ones and I thought the J.K
B	erm Philip Pullman
A	yes
B	yeah
A	so I crossed those out cos I thought
B	yup
A	actually I'm not reading those cos I'm a grown up and I don't need to
B	yes
A	part of them all possibly more than that
B	oh
A	actually as you said before with
B	yeah
A	it depends on the quality of the translation
B	yeah yeah
A	because erm
B	yeah
A	and you cannot imagine for a second why it's on the top list hundred list of novels in fact it's very long
B	yes
A	like if it was just length
B	yes
A	anyway
B	yes
A	so but erm
B	yes erm
A	mm
B	and er wrote a lot of stuff
A	mm
B	so
A	mm
B	by Caccini erm which again I came across this year and
A	oh
B	Purcell Purcell's
A	oh right okay
B	Purcell's
A	mm
B	which I quite enjoyed cos
B	erm
A	oh right
B	between that
A	well
B	so
A	okay
B	but erm but I'll I'll take the Thomas Arne for audition pieces for next term
A	mm
B	erm
A	oh do you have to audition to go to these places?
B	erm no but next term
A	oh that's an interesting approach
B	which is yeah I
A	yeah
B	erm with the with the shifting
A	rather than swapping square pegs into round holes or whatever
B	exactly yeah
A	and I guess actually it's just the lack of
B	yes yes erm
A	mm
B	and who's
A	yeah
B	whose whose staying on for another year and whose
A	that must be frustrating as well losing people that you know you're thinking oh yes that's person is going to key up and be a central person here and they just wander off cos they get another job or their circumstance has changed or something
B	you know week three only half the choir turns up you know where are all the others? well so-and-so's got an instrumental lesson and so-and-so's
A	so tonight I'm going to have fines if you don't turn up
A	yes so I was erm talking to
B	oh is it?
A	well yeah no no I mean not
B	oh yes
A	any particular day of the week but any individual so
B	yes
A	erm there you know they'd be I I can't come
B	of course
A	to class unless it's Friday afternoon and he was cos he's a proper artist he was like oh you know
[ANNOTATION]	Person A could not attend the class unless it were on Friday	Entailment
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said yes	Entailment
A	why it should be effective by the lack of
B	yes
A	and then certainly in
B	yes
A	because they only get paid by results so if you drop out
B	yes
A	or you don't turn up or only half the people wander in and they're late
B	yes
A	so they actually now call you up they send you a text or something they say where are you?
B	yes yes I I hadn't realised until last year
A	I didn't know
B	oh yeah yeah erm
A	I only went to three lectures in the whole three years
B	yes
A	but we learned early that if you wanted to drop out you had to drop out quick because if you were if you got down to the last sort of half dozen they started to realise who you were and certainly you could be followed up if you dropped out really early then nobody could quite track whether you were ever
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think  it is really early for quite	Neutral
B	right
A	supposed to have been there or not
A	mm
B	paying such vast fees for
A	mm
B	for erm for their for their education
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said the paying is for their education	Neutral
A	yes well I think
B	er
A	we were all we were conscientious you couldn't
B	mm
A	so erm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said we were conscientious you couldn't	Neutral
B	mm
A	so you couldn't
B	yeah
A	it
B	yeah yeah
A	perhaps
A	mm
B	erm he was due on a
A	mm
B	at twelve midday so he got to leave erm
A	yes
B	of the of the lecturer
A	yes
B	and and
A	when was this?
B	this was last summer
A	oh yeah no I think a lot of people work through
B	erm
A	now
B	they do they do but I mean one of the
A	mm
B	getting grants and not having to pay tuition fees cos in
A	I can't see why that's desirable
B	erm
A	I really can't I mean I I suppose that that I'm
B	mm
A	you know
B	mm
A	and we were a very small percentage of our age who could go and er perhaps it's only now that I look at it and think quite clearly that was such a privilege
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	that amount of money to be invested in you as an individual with no kind of expectation at the end of it erm
B	mm
A	and erm so I did I did value it I valued it cos
B	yes yes
A	and
B	yeah yeah
A	but erm but anyway
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	it's good though isn't it? I don't have to go right up to the wire on this so I don't know allowing for erm who of us
B	helicopters
A	and that is a helicopter well that's just about it isn't it? the end of
