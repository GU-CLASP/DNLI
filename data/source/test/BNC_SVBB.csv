A	that's what I say cos it needs to be sound of and one word
B	a sound of chopping
A	no
B	sound of advanced knife skills
A	no you can't be too eloquent it just needs to be really brief so I put
B	be good if you one day transcribed an actual murder happening
A	well I've transcribed a lot
B	and sent in
A	well people send in all sorts of things
B	that would be Roald Dahlian
A	it is weird
B	and then the murderer would discover that he's sent the tape

B	recording
A	that's right
B	of the murder they'd track you down and kill you
A	and he'd have to murder again
B	and then all the police would have
A	yes

A	could they not get out of their car though?
C	well yes yeah and I suspect that they did I think
B	yeah they could stroll around
C	but then you you hear that the carpark at Bluewater is two hundred and forty acres
A	so
C	that's a hell of a
A	I don't know acres
C	well an acre is
A	it's that big
C	a football pitch is an acre I think so you're talking about
A	yeah
C	two hundred and forty football pitches well talk about
A	well what caused it though?
C	just too many cars were there and you know arriving and leaving at the same time and just gridlocking
A	oh that's so awful
C	mm
A	I've never heard of that happening before
C	and people were sort of saying that the whole car park area and
B	clearly
A	well obviously yes
C	mm
B	nothing
A	so much for just nipping out to do your Christmas shopping
C	mm
A	oh no that would put you off going out for a while wouldn't it?
C	mm
A	and the car
C	well interestingly
B	that's really annoying
C	well it's
B	not useful at all
C	because the M25 had problems but luckily we'd got we passed through an area then created a problem but
B	after what junction?
C	they said no the junctions that are a real problem was the twelve till ten which we use but they were fine when we were there but they were saying
A	well yes I suppose it would be
C	and er you know
A	but I mean that would really traumatise you
C	oh yeah
A	for a long time
C	mm
A	if that happened
C	yeah
A	you'd probably sell your car but it makes you makes public transport look like heaven
C	mm
A	oh no
C	well
A	but then you can't just leave
C	you can't just leave a car actually no
A	people think they can't leave it but on the other hand
C	it would have been towed away and you would have had to pay something
A	on the other hand and and then it would be even more gridlock cos people would
C	well yes yeah
A	have left their car
C	yeah yeah
A	but there would come a point when you'd have to do that really wouldn't you?
C	well
A	if you don't know what's happening
C	if you're sat there for six hours
A	and you don't know when you're gonna get out of it you know?
C	well
A	that's the other thing
C	I suppose you see it would be a long time before the police were called in so
A	yes it would
C	so nobody could tell anybody anything anyway
A	no
C	it's not like there's an
C	cos if there's
A	intercom system
C	yeah mm
A	at least if you're on a train there's an intercom system
C	mm
A	or when you're gonna be moving again
B	alright
D	yeah but are you sure this was? I thought this
B	uhu
D	is there more than one Bluewater?
A	er
D	cos I thought the one they were talking about was in the west of London
A	there's two west what's the one at Stratford called? Westfield
B	mm
A	there's two two Westfields I think there's only one Bluewater
B	well there's one east
D	yes
B	is there a different one?
D	well there's a huge one somewhere in the west of
B	well then there are two
A	well then there are two
B	then there are two cos it's not the one that we could get the bus to if we so were inclined
A	that's the one we keep meaning to get the bus to isn't it?
B	well not keep meaning but
A	well one day
C	well certainly not over Christmas
A	and certainly not yeah
C	mm cos the buses must have been well I suppose the buses wouldn't well they
A	no
C	wouldn't go anywhere near the car park but
A	no
C	all the road system in the area
A	oh
C	was all blocked
C	and if you'd bought things like ice cream it would to put in the freezer
A	that would be that wouldn't it?
C	you know
A	what a disaster
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	it was unpleasant	Entailment
C	and if you'd got
A	oh no what if they had
A	children in the car
C	mm I was gonna say
A	oh no
C	if you've got screaming tots
A	or a baby
C	mm
A	oh yeah
C	you know at at home
A	yeah

A	okay go and sit down
B	yes
C	fridges are never big enough at this time of
A	no
C	no I mean however big a fridge is it's never big enough

B	not he's not
C	had your ones at lunchtime did you darling?
D	ah
C	they're they're nice and
D	yeah
C	so
B	mm
B	no he uses a German company called Pieroth or maybe it's Pieroth
D	oh right yeah they do a lot of German
B	it's a Germany company
D	yeah yeah and they've been running years
B	but it's really difficult to check what you're buying on their website because I think they're just used as an intermediary who maybe just buy their own wine
C	he stills gets copious quantities of the stuff really
B	yeah
C	doesn't he?
D	hey
B	give one to
D	millionaire slice
C	mm
D	mum used to make this
C	I did
B	I never had it
B	no

C	of which you were one
B	on occasion
C	have you got lights out there? I'm seeing blue lights
A	yes he has
B	that's my keg of beer
A	he decorated his keg of beer
C	oh right

C	that'll be well chilled then
C	that will be well
D	what have you got there
C	should be good
B	your wine you bought yeah
C	and this is the one from
B	it's weird cos it's a Spanish wine but it's written in Portuguese
D	oh really?
B	yeah
D	mm
D	I thought the austere label was quite promising
B	yes
D	this is so good
B	have another one
D	so good
B	we need to finish them
C	thirteen and a half percent
B	that's a lot for a red these days
C	mm yeah
C	so tell me the meeting when you and
B	it had already been negotiated
C	when?
B	over the phone
C	oh right
B	with
C	thousand right
D	there's been much debate about that down in
C	yeah
D	first of all with
C	yeah
C	yeah
C	well I mean to say they're just
C	pardon?
B	why it occurred to
C	yeah
B	just Scottish that's all I can put it down to
C	but
B	it doesn't make any sense from any angle
C	yeah
C	but
D	such a sum was
C	well we
C	he's what?
C	oh he's
B	yeah
C	oh yeah I was saying he was
B	well when I was there it was none of my business so I didn't
C	you thought
B	advised someone in their late seventies with an incurable degenerative disease to invest a windfall in a five-year locked down account?
C	yeah well you see
B	they probably did that
A	no but it wouldn't it have been
B	I I er verbally yes but on instruction
A	well they might not even have met
B	no I I'm sure most of it would have been negotiated over the phone
A	with
C	oh really?
A	well cos if uncle
B	yeah because you don't wanna trawl in
A	they wouldn't even understand what he says
C	yeah well
A	so he would
B	but
C	but I mean there's just no
B	of course he will be
C	yeah but pardon? he will
B	of course he will be
A	well
C	he's about the only person who would
A	you know who's gonna you know who's gonna benefit from it
B	MS only knocks off about
C	yes
B	five six years off your life expectancy so what it will what's the life expectancy for a male UK male then? early eighties?
C	well you I mean five years
B	it's about that
C	takes them to there yeah
B	but and and then the point is the irony well not it's an irony at the end of that five years you've got fifty grand more but so what?
C	yeah but how do you?
B	you've had three hundred and something anyway plus you've had another
C	yeah
B	I think maybe it was predicated then on the fact that he knew he was getting more than that immediately
C	yeah so
B	and was hoping he will spend
C	well well and I'm and I'm hoping he will get
B	yeah he'll get it it's just being held up by the taxman
C	yeah but you know that's a
B	well his salary is thirty-seven thousand per annum
D	really?
B	before tax but that's three erm
C	pensions
B	three pensions
D	oh right
D	wow
B	the
C	what's the
B	erm
C	oh right
B	and his state pension
C	yeah oh right
C	that's a lot more or vastly more than our combined
B	why what's your is your pension a private one?
C	our total pension for both of us is just over twenty-five thousand is that right?
B	per annum?
D	around about
C	yeah
C	yes
B	what's the tax rate on a pension? cos it won't be income tax will it? or is it?
C	well there is yeah but but I pay income tax
B	it's like capital gains I think
C	well yeah I I don't I pay income tax on my little earnings
B	yeah but what's your earnings?
C	I get a well I last year I earned seven hundred pounds
B	do you fill in a tax return form?
C	no
B	well then how do you get taxed?
A	well no you'll pay PAYE that one won't it?
C	that
A	yeah
B	yeah but if you're already paying that should be tax that shouldn't be taxed anyway it's not enough
C	well I well I that but that's what I thought
A	no it shouldn't be
B	the threshold is like twelve
A	the threshold is ten er it's
C	well I I thought so I mean
C	yeah
B	well you should be pocketing every penny of it
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	other than erm
C	I maybe I should be
A	I don't
B	well if you're over the age if you're over the retirement age would you still actually contribute to the what's it called
A	what National Insurance contributions?
B	yeah I think you probably would wouldn't you?
A	maybe
B	that would be the only tax coming out though National Insurance I reckon there wouldn't be any income tax
C	no
A	I don't think there should be unless you were doing a tax return and everything else was taken into account
B	there isn't everything else
A	oh there isn't an everything else is there?
C	no that's our
B	well it would be erm
C	that's our er the rest is just pensions oh
A	er which is already
C	mm
A	you don't pay tax on pensions do you?
B	you do yeah
A	or am I being incredibly stupid?
B	you do yes
A	do you?
B	that's what they said in the bank
C	but yes it would what a a shame that you weren't able to ask this fellow because you know he would it should be
B	it wasn't the chap who advised him we were in that chap's office
C	but he wasn't there
B	but he wasn't it wasn't that chap
B	kind of annoyingly whoever it was was with his supervisor I think cos he was training more than they thought this might be tricky or they might have thought it might be tricky I don't know
A	though it's weird that one moment
B	and there were two of them
A	he's got all that money and then
C	seeing
B	yeah
C	right
A	the next he's taken out a loan
C	when when he when he took put that
B	when I arrived with him
C	oh well yeah oh right
B	but he was introduced as this is my supervisor who's just gonna sit here
C	yeah ah
B	I didn't know if he was a junior he was like in his twenties
C	yeah
B	er five
C	five percent?
B	or five point two
C	yeah
B	he's got to repay eighteen grand obviously so
C	yeah in in what period of time?
B	er I can't remember
C	a year or
C	oh right just
B	thirty-two months or something like that
C	yeah yeah
B	but if he gets the windfall within the next two weeks he can just cancel it
C	yeah
B	otherwise you've got a penalty to pay
C	yeah well well that's not a huge amount sixty days is it?
B	no and it's much less than the two grand if he waited
C	uhu uhu
A	thirtieth
C	and when does he come back?
A	about the fifth
C	sixth?
A	about the fifth?
C	fifth?
B	the bones? no
