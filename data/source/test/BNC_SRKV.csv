B	and get caught
A	mm
B	maybe by the younger girl
A	yeah
B	isn't the same but knew
A	yeah
B	the MO but it's either he the person knows the killer or the person is in the police force
A	why would they know the person's in the police force?
B	because
A	oh right
B	which means they either a copycat killer
A	yeah
B	who knows the killer because I dunno how much they've publicised in the press but we don't know that do we? the the the
A	mm
B	bottle and
A	yeah
A	yeah but it would seem for dramatic purposes to be quite good but it would mean that
B	oh I'm gonna get myself another half
A	oh okay
B	because you take so long
A	cos I'm taking ages
B	jesus fucking hell
A	what's the problem?
B	it's five pounds twenty
A	sorry darling it's what it costs when you leave the house isn't it?
B	for a bottle of beer
A	what in the
B	in the
A	three four
B	I think it's four quid a pint
A	oh my god that's half a pint
B	I guess that's they have a flat rate for bottled
A	yeah
B	oh of course the serial killer got
A	Tommy Lee
B	got er I hope it was him
A	exactly
A	well this is the thing cos it might not be
B	I guess it must be the er
A	it might not we don't know
B	but will they find out well what would she just feed the body to the pigs?
A	but if he he didn't actually say that it was him did he?
B	kind of no I suppose not erm
A	erm someone said in a review that that is the same as Of Mice and Men
B	Steinbeck
A	is that a play?
B	but she won't
A	no I don't think she cares
B	because she did it for her boy
A	I
B	doing it for her boy
A	and doing what's best yeah
B	so he's not cos she could just feed him to the pigs cos they will eat anything
A	raw? or would she have to cook?
B	no they'll no they'll eat anything piggies
A	they'll eat a
B	have to bash it up a bit
A	would they?
B	yeah that's why all those Muslims and Jews don't like pigs cos they're omnivorous
A	so is any
B	cows won't eat a a
A	what
B	a sheep wouldn't
A	so they only eat an animal that eats vegetables?
B	no cows and sheep don't eat any erm
A	that's weird cos they're eating er
[ANNOTATION]	Muslims don't eat pigs because they are very fat.	Contradiction
B	they're herbivores
A	but they're yeah the Muslims are eating
B	yeah they're eating other creatures that
A	a creature
B	they don't like pigs because pigs eat anything
A	they don't like the idea
B	like that erm is he Australian? American? that serial killer who murdered about fifty possibly and he ran a pig farm cos so they just got mashed and fed to the pigs
A	oh
B	but does she call the police and say what she's done and why?
A	yeah
B	or does she feed him to the pigs and carry on with her life and say he ran away?
A	er it depends how much she wants to protect herself from what she's done
B	mind you shooting him in the middle of the kitchen isn't a good way to hide you could have
A	no they are in the middle of nowhere though
B	she could have led him outside
[ANNOTATION]	A serial killer fed his pigs with his victim.	Entailment
A	they're in the middle of nowhere though
B	no but the police will come if she wanted to hide that what she's done
A	oh yeah yeah no I think maybe she's not bothered I wouldn't be bothered if I was her
A	yeah
B	but it's a flat rate cos I remember buying a can of beer in erm in the
[ANNOTATION]	Police doesn't arrive when people want them.	Contradiction
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	five quid
A	it's erm Geronimo's is flat rate then
B	Young's
A	it's a
B	yeah okay
A	yeah okay
[ANNOTATION]	The speakers talk about food places.	Entailment
B	no that burgundy's red darling
A	oh no it is oh no what am I looking for then?
B	that cushion's burgundy
A	taupe?
B	taupe yes it could be
A	it's a a blue
B	teal but that's teal is a very
[ANNOTATION]	The cushion is total balck.	Contradiction
A	teal
B	sort of greyish type taupe you might be right
A	mm oh well
B	T A U P E
A	no aquamarine is more yeah I guess that's got a greeny quality though
B	didn't fucking turn up
B	in hindsight you see although
A	got a two one though didn't you?
B	paying
A	yeah amazing
B	not really
A	no you are you well well if you're not then you're lucky to have been hot housed enough to have enough of whatever it takes to get a decent degree through doing ten minutes' work
B	I've always been a bit lazy academically apart from when I did my UCL course and I knew
A	yeah
B	I was paying for then
A	yeah
B	so I milked it for every single penny
A	exactly it was always the ones who were paying for it who actually asked questions in lectures and
B	oh like the like like er
A	the mature students and things
B	the mature students
A	always in there
B	were so keen
A	with like yeah well
B	and they'd read the book that you're
A	exactly
B	studying and you go like what?
A	the rest of the bloody lecture theatre's falling asleep
B	I mean I did a whole
A	cos they're hung over
B	I did a whole three-hour exam on a book I've never read in my first year
A	how did you how the hell did you
B	well I just bollocks I thought I was doing really really well but I hadn't read the book so er
A	did you pass the exam?
B	so they suggested that I I switch course
A	what did you do in the first place?
B	I enrolled as an English literature student
A	you see I think you're better off for life purposes doing English language than English literature
B	like maths
A	like maths yeah because I'm already creative and all that shit
B	well there's different
A	I need a bit of balance you know
B	there's a different way to describe I mean like history's subjective but you're dealing with objective facts whereas literature
A	it's still subjective
B	there's no objective fact other than the work of art itself
A	yeah
B	any interpretation then becomes subjective
A	and and it's up to who marks it what they think as well
B	the sweet the little boy's just shut the door
A	it
B	darling you're probably not very scientificy
A	no I'm not exactly but I that is why I would
B	would you like me to cut these off?
A	yeah no I tell what I'd like cut off is
B	I might rework this
A	it
B	for the new season
A	dips in things
B	I might rework the whole thing
A	it was when that whole sort of slightly bondage look was in
B	I'm trying to think what I've got to cut it
A	so hence I've got bits of er belt sticking out here and there and it's er superfluous and I don't need it thank you
B	trying to think what I've got darling that would cut through that
A	yeah otherwise it's a very you don't need to cut through it
B	I'd get rid of that
A	you just you just cut that and then it comes off
B	I know but then you've got a loose end
A	yeah
B	you don't
A	oh right
B	and I'd cut it off here
A	no it's
B	of course it does it's
A	what a waste of er stuff it's otherwise a very comfortable warm coat
B	it's like your most longest running coat
A	uhu no it's not my longest running coat is the Vivienne Westwood
B	you can tell notes and everything
A	I can't tell notes
B	it's good I remember when
A	orchestra?
B	who played in the
A	okay
B	Gilbert and Sullivan
A	ah
B	I think
A	sweet
B	and she could tell a false note in an orchestra where I was just hearing
A	yeah
B	noise
A	mm
B	but you've got an ear like that
A	well I
B	haven't you darling?
A	I mean the thing is my my big sleepless night thing is how much I just fucking should've done music in my lifetime and
B	well I never had that either did I?
A	who I don't know why that's a disgrace that you didn't because you had parents that could've done it as well
A	yeah but did they put you into it when you were five or four? no cos that's when you have to start so it becomes natural
B	well they'd already had enough by that point
A	well they'd had enough but I was always plonking away at the piano so nobody noticed that I was picking up tunes on the piano or suggested it at a very early age
B	it's terrible
A	it's terrible
A	yeah and I've done incredibly well from from not knowing anything but it is terrible
A	I know Brian Wilson and
B	I bet John Cale can though
A	but on a personal level it's deeply frustrating and
B	and you could you could then also erm what's it called? when you make music? do you remember? we sent something to my daddy to be
A	yeah
A	well transcribe it and stuff
A	but I mean the thing is
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A did poorly in spite of having a lot of experience.	Contradiction
B	and then you'd be doing gigs
A	yeah
B	in somewhere like the
A	yeah I can still I can still learn how to do it it's just that we're looking at ten years
B	I can't believe that cost me five
A	sorry
B	I'm sorry darling had like five cans of beer
A	yeah there's me getting really existentialist and that's the really
[ANNOTATION]	They are avoiding beer tonight.	Contradiction
B	that's what
A	yeah
B	cos I know you're here all along
A	well I
A	I can understand that cos that's like
B	plus it's not really a
A	terrible
B	it's more rhetorical anyway darling it
A	are you gonna revamp my coat for the next
B	yes
A	season then?
[ANNOTATION]	They had more than 2 beers.	Entailment
B	I'd quite enjoy doing it
A	are you gonna add a few things like
B	it's a bit like when I
A	you could add some ribbons or something
[ANNOTATION]	The coat will be left as it is currently.	Contradiction
B	I'm not allowed
A	you know it's like
B	I'm not allowed
A	like one of these books on revamp your clothes
B	I'm not allowed to cut your hair any more
A	no
B	so this could be like a an equivalent
A	mm
B	thing a creative outlet
A	you could put a few safety pins in it possibly
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will cut speaker A's hair tomorrow when they are not drunk.	Contradiction
B	no I'm underplaying the bondage
A	well it's time it got I mean that's so impractical cos it just like
B	why do you do them up like that anyway? why isn't it done up
B	no but I mean if this
A	okay well change the
[ANNOTATION]	B is not allowed to cut their hair either.	Entailment
A	yeah I don't know actually oh because then it sticks out like that and then it hooks on things
B	and then you get trapped
B	ah I can imagine you would darling
B	that's coming straight off
A	it's such a bad coat
B	I'm gonna get out my craft knife
A	cos er to try and do it up myself is impossible as well
B	have you ever washed it?
A	no
B	we've never washed that have we darling?
A	but on the other hand it's really comfortable to wear
A	yeah
A	yeah it is
B	don't be so existential drink up and we'll get you some food in your tummy and then we get you home
A	yeah but it is a relevant question isn't it?
B	not really no it's not that important
A	where do I go from here?
B	on a on a bricks and mortar scale we've got our
A	but it is
B	house
A	because it is about bricks and mortar though
B	and our
A	ritual suicide?
B	naughty
A	sorry say that again I forgot I didn't hear
B	it stopped you committing to loving me ten years ago that sort of attitude
A	oh yeah yeah it's true cos it goes very much beyond all that
B	existential
A	well I don't mind I'm happy to eat out
A	mm
B	oh chips
A	which I'd have with you'd have it with cheese I'd have it with the pate that I've got left it would be cheaper and then we could just go to bed
B	got half a bottle of wine at home
B	and then we wake up in the morning and there's a whole
A	yeah
B	it would be nice though
A	it would be nice
B	would be nice to have a quick meal
A	be nice to go home actually it's true
B	er I agree
A	shall we just go home?
A	no
B	yet er well let's go to the Chinese and have just a small quick meal
A	yeah
B	and in and out
A	yeah
B	okay darling drink up
A	I thought I was quite good at getting started this morning though wasn't I?
B	very good I was wanting you to take a long time so I could watch the football but in the end of course the football was a disaster
A	hold on I've got this
B	drink your wine first pickles ah
A	actually
B	livid
A	gonna be so angry with us
B	unless it's one of those days where he's been out on adventures and he's curled up fast asleep and doesn't realise
A	I think he would have been out on adventures cos it was a very nice day
B	that's what I mean and then when he does that he's sometimes not aware cos if he's fast asleep
A	that's more impractical you see cos I'll get that hooked up on things
B	I agree
A	so
B	that would be embarrassing
A	it's er it's almost like a booby trap
B	shall
A	coat really
A	and er the whole thing has to come off really yeah and then I've got that
B	it's wrong
A	that really bloody worries me
B	come on then cuddles
A	I don't want to force it down
B	oh
A	no
B	shall I wait here or shall I go
