A	yeah that's more that's more like it isn't it
B	alright
A	quiet?
B	very quiet
A	I met
B	yes how was that?
A	yeah it was alright I was sat next to her I didn't recognise who she was the best thing about the the conference was really good this year by the way
B	was it?
A	one of the best things about it massive name tags so you didn't have to like squint and peer at people's like chest to work out who they were
B	did she know who you were then when you said?
A	when I said I'm
B	bless her
A	but yeah we're in a really interesting talk actually a CLIL which was really good erm by the same guy that did the erm FCE talk but he was a lot better and he was talking about his own thing erm
B	mm
A	and the principal who I've met on various occasions had lots of conversations with either didn't recognise me or didn't want to talk to me which was fine because he's not
B	mm
A	erm yes so I talked to
B	is that what she said?
A	teaching students yeah
B	is she?
A	that's what she said and she described it as a demotion
B	she
A	yeah
B	at the moment
A	I also saw
B	well
A	yeah that's yeah that's what she said
B	yeah and a lot of people weren't happy about it but
A	so a bit of everyone's? who's then?
B	a bit of everyone a bit of mine a bit of
A	okay
B	they just created this role for her and
A	yeah and how are you about it? you've worked with her quite a lot this year though haven't you? you alright with it?
B	we get on yeah well we get on really well
A	yeah so you're fine with a bit of because you've worked together this year so you know what it's like working with her with you in your position and her
B	no
A	why not?
B	she feels victimised at the moment
A	oh
B	she feels like
A	everything to do with work? or not everything to do with work?
B	yeah she feels that they're trying to make her quit her job
A	okay
B	that they're pushing her out they're trying to
A	do you think they are?
B	I don't know they're not making her feel very comfortable or welcome
A	but there's so few people that could do
B	but no one understands her job
A	I totally understand it
B	that's the problem
A	yeah you have to be yeah I would say I haven't met them all
B	mm mm I know
A	well that's quite enough for
B	mm
A	I bet she doesn't like that?
B	no I don't think that's a problem erm
A	mm well but yes no it was nice to meet her but yeah the conference was really good out of all the years to miss you really shouldn't have missed this one it was really good it was actually genuinely good not just good for a southwest conference
B	okay
A	and most and lots of people who I spoke to said
B	mm
A	it's really interesting so they had the new chair or chief exec whoever he is of English UK who was kind of blah blah blah blah blah blah you know like they are erm until this really pompous guy asked the most stupidest question which was really long-winded and clearly designed to test this guy's knowledge and trip him up so he said well you said this but obviously according to so and so's research from 1985 blah blah blah oh it was awful and the guy the guy that was doing the plenary very politely very thoroughly completely slammed him it was brilliant
B	oh good
A	erm so he was really interesting and then
B	wasn't
B	bit brain-dead
A	yeah erm and I went to a talk on about teaching advanced learners which was really interesting
B	oh yeah
A	with a guy who's a doctor
B	his wife died last year and that's why he didn't go
A	oh
B	that's why the one the other one got cancelled last year erm how to make the best out of your team
A	he did that this year
B	yeah
A	oh I didn't realise he was supposed to go last year oh god well he did both of those this year how to make the best of your team I talked to
B	oh
A	where you have minimum the minimum length of course is what four weeks? erm so it's quite different for having a permanent team of teachers as opposed to having a very fluid team of teachers
B	yes
A	it's interesting though they'd erm I think I might do try and implement a couple of
B	that's what we tried to do for the inspection week
A	oh just for the inspection week?
B	well
B	the inspectors were there well it's something that came up leading to because we did so many workshops leading to this
A	yes yeah
B	and one of the things was to standardise the way we do we mark
A	yes yeah exactly
B	because if you have a teacher then you go and get another teacher and the other teacher does it a different way it's just
A	well yeah I thought erm it sounded it sounded interesting erm and one of the benefits I think was when the students come and say well I don't like my teacher I don't feel like I'm learning enough if there's a clash of personalities he can go well actually I know that all the teachers do this in their class so the kind of the director of studies has a clear idea of what's actually going on and can talk to the students go well I know what's happening in your class because it happens in every class
A	but yeah no I didn't go to that one I went to
B	mm
A	and then I went to one on storytelling
B	ah
A	which was really interactive like almost I almost didn't go because he
B	ah
A	tricking people tricking the students into discussing philosophical ideas it was very interesting actually it was all really good I was really surprised I didn't go last year and then this year it was great
B	okay so what freebies did you get?
A	no bloody tickets
B	no?
A	I was really annoyed just loads of pens and books and I don't know but no tickets I was I was quite annoyed by that
B	what did
A	erm that they
B	uh huh
A	really nice
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	so I covered that and the two boys were in that class and after they finished their test we just had a chat with them they were very sweet Yemeni boys not Saudi but I think they possibly lived in Saudi
B	oh I thought they were Saudi
A	Yemeni so really hard working and sweet not your typical lazy arse Saudi boys erm and they they've the school had been in in contact with the mosque in
B	it is really sad
A	I
B	do you know any of the details of?
A	no I no
B	because who was on the mobile phone? the driver or him?
A	I don't know that I I only know what I read in the Herald Express the other day and what
B	well that's what I've heard I don't know if it's true because
A	yeah it just could've been either of them really couldn't it but it was just
B	where was it?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure where is it	Neutral
A	just
B	because I heard that he was the driver was blinded by the sun
A	yeah I remember you told me that it hasn't been very sunny recently though has it? not exactly blinding sunshine weather is it?
B	when you come round that bend and the sun's
A	which bend was it?
A	which one's that?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
B	you know where the train station is?
A	is it? was it on the pedestrian crossing? or sort of between the two pedestrian crossings?
B	between the two I think
A	it is so hard to drive fast around there
B	mm
A	was he not driving very fast?
B	I don't think so no
A	but that's quite hard to it's quite hard to
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about drive fast	Entailment
A	no I don't really I don't know anything else other than that
B	and his poor family
A	yeah so sad
B	and the driver has got to live with that
A	yeah but why are they appealing for witnesses? cos I
B	I guess to see if anyone was on their phones if he was looking the right way
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about right way	Entailment
A	mm
B	erm if there were any other cars that might have caused him to
A	yeah
B	swerve
A	I suppose
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah must be yeah devastating and so unexpected as well because whenever you talk to them I'm going to do this I'm going to university then I'm going to go home and ah you know
B	really? I thought he was sixteen
A	yeah I'm pretty sure he was
B	I thought he was sixteen
A	yeah I don't think he was sixteen I know ages tend to be quite fluid with the
B	yeah
A	yeah right then shall we go into town?
B	yeah

B	oh
A	it's erm chick spiced chickpea with homemade curd cheese wellington
A	it sounds a bit weird
B	is she going?
A	no but I did ask her about it and she said well we put curd cheese on everything in Canada so that sounds quite nice to me I was like alright I'll take your word for it but the starter and the dessert look nice so I'm sure I'll survive or I'll just eat the vegetables
B	er mine is next Friday as well
A	is your up in London? oh my god so when yeah when are you up?
B	it's a shame though when the company is meant to be doing so badly and they're cutting back here there and everywhere why are they going to spend like ten grand or so
B	to send us all to London
A	is that how much it's going to cost?
B	well I imagine so there's like
A	I I agree
B	thirty people staying in a hotel going on a cruise up the the
A	I agree on the one hand but on the other hand I think it's yeah
B	it's too extravagant
A	er yeah I suppose it is actually they could just pay for a meal down here couldn't they?
