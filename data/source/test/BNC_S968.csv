D	you were nearly asleep weren't you darling?
F	he is tired but it's last day of the holiday well night so
B	right ready then? this is really easy right?
unknown_female	yeah
B	yeah? are you ready
unknown_female	yeah
B	good boy okay right so we're all gonna have like these piles of cards in front of us and they're all gonna be face down when it comes to you you've gotta turn it this way out right? so the table sees it before you do not this way like that but this way you put it face down and the next person will put it face down when you've got two symbols that are matching doesn't matter about the colour the symbols have gotta be matching if you and another person have got the same card with the same symbol you've gotta take the totem pole and the person who doesn't take the totem pole when they should has got to collect all the cards that have gone down
D	a bit like snap
B	a little bit like snap you wanna get rid of your cards right? but if you make a mistake cos they look really similar that's the problem that they like that and that is not the same they look really similar in the heat of the moment
D	yeah
B	so say I put that down
B	apart from that there's three magic cards so whenever you see that arrows going in that means everyone has a free throw to take the totem pole and the person who wins can decide how the cards are divided up right?
F	okay
B	so that's like everyone in right? all in
F	so only has to be one of them?
B	yeah and then you all go in
F	yeah
B	this means that just I'll explain it when it happens
B	so don't do anything I'll explain it when it happens and this means the only thing that's gotta be the same now is the colour so if I do that
F	yeah
B	me and
F	so you two have got yeah
B	so only colours now and we're both trying to take a totem pole
C	Jesus
B	you can
A	it's really simple
