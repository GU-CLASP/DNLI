C	I like Asda
A	when you do the price comparison things it's close to Sainsbury's for a lot of it
D	really?
A	mm but they do very clever marketing
D	mm
A	to make you believe that it's cheap
D	that's interesting
A	mm I always find it
C	you can get
A	very expensive when I go
C	you can get you can get plain chocolate for like one pound thirty
A	mm yeah
C	and it's like two litres
A	because they do a lot of their super value food
C	no one litre
A	for very cheap so it makes you think yeah that's really cheap but actually
D	yeah
A	they have a lot of stuff that's like a pound and things like that but actually it's
A	but they'll call it a pound and you just think oh it's only a quid
D	yeah

A	no way
D	mm
C	I'm all done
D	all done is it?
C	eat up eat up mum eat up
D	I'm
C	do you wanna be a big strong

A	they don't eat vegetables?
D	mm no no some
A	what do they eat?
D	maybe er
A	mm?
C	I do eat some
C	I do eat vegetables just sometimes you just don't cook the right vegetables and sometimes you might cook a vegetable that I like but you might put it in a horrible sauce that I hate
D	you're very picky
C	I think your cooking's very nice
C	it's just sometimes you might make like a mixture of everything and I might like the vegetables
D	mm
C	or
A	do you like stir-fry?
C	I might like sauce and not the vegetables mm?
A	do you like stir-fries?
C	I I really don't like stir-fries
A	don't you?
C	cos er I really hate the sauces in stir-fries I mean I'm a big sauce fan I love sauces but
A	what sauces do you like?
C	Thai green curry sauce
A	mm
C	it's really annoying because you can never it's really hard to tell which kind of type of curry you're gonna get
A	mm mm
C	cos sometimes my mum will go and get one the first
D	yeah
C	I
A	oh you liked it did you?
C	I love spicy
A	mm
C	like I might've been like crying afterwards
C	I cried through
A	cried through the pain
C	happy happy painful tears it was
A	mm mm
C	and then she got another one but it's like not spicy at all
A	yeah some of them can be really mild
C	but they should have names on them like spicy or mild
A	so
C	not
A	in sauces or anything like that so I can't do stir-fries for
C	I really like wraps
A	wraps? yeah
D	we make wraps and
C	I would actually if you got me like if you got me some broccoli some sort of pure broccoli
A	yeah
C	I'd make like a forest in there
C	and make it all nice
A	and avocado I like avocado
C	oh in a wrap?
A	yeah all nicely mashed up with a little bit of chilli sauce on
C	that'd be so good
D	mm
A	can you make guacamole? have you ever made it before?
C	I've heard of guacamole I've never made it
A	if you like avocados you will love guacamole
D	oh I love guacamole
A	but you should probably make your own I always prefer my own to a shop-bought one
C	yeah
A	cos I don't mash it up so much I don't mash the avocado into like a paste I keep lumps and bumps in it and that's what I prefer
C	is it spicy?
A	it's as spicy as you want it really
D	can be
A	if you make it yourself
C	oh
A	then you just chop up your avocado lemon juice bit of chilli sauce very finely chopped onion
C	what what I like I don't like using chilli sauce I like to get a red chilli pepper
