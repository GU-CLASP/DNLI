B	is
A	well because we live apart she she is doing it yeah so
B	ah right of course yeah
C	that's it
B	yeah
A	oh
C	twenty-fourth of the fourth in
D	er some of us are
B	I can't see in this light
D	how can chicken tikka masala
B	I won the raffle
D	only be four hundred and fifty calories?
B	that's what I was thinking
A	must be like
C	don't get too excited
B	it's it's quite big and especially if you go large
E	can you please tell me how every raffle you seem to go into at the minute you win but we win jack shit for the Lottery
C	perhaps you need to buy the ticket face to face
E	okay
C	must be what it is
E	can you please buy the ticket that's going to win
unknown_female	yeah
A	if it's discounted and you discount the calories as well
B	or well no that's it there he reckons if you go large and add the samosa and a large onion bhaji
D	mm
B	it's only two hundred and forty calories
C	that's and for the two extra bits of
D	it's
B	yeah
C	sweet potato which is rubbish cos a samosa cannot be two hundred calories
B	that's what I'm saying
A	no a samosa
B	well I think that sounds lovely
unknown_female	right
A	fried in some
D	well I'm having it anyway
E	I ain't looked yet
D	or do you want a samosa?
B	I'm not sure if I'm gonna have the curry
C	the flaming dragon curry I'll have that
B	yeah
C	hot chicken curry and diced chicken breast red peppers curry
A	I also think that unless that bowl of chips is huge it's not gonna be
D	yeah
A	seven hundred and ninety-six calories
D	there are some quite worrying statistics on there both ways underestimates and overestimates aren't there?
A	yeah
B	I think the chips were a big bowl
A	that was absolutely huge and like deep fried three times to bring up the calories
B	I quite like the look of that pasta
C	which one?
D	it's that one
B	oh you get a drink as well
A	the superfood pasta
D	cos that looks ostensibly like I would be able to have it
B	oh she's starting already
C	yeah
D	that that's all free food isn't it?
C	yeah
D	yeah?
C	yeah
D	so I'm gonna try it cos then if I like it I can have it every night
A	want some chicken breast in there?
B	but then
D	I might have it it's
B	do you not have your last supper and just try it next time?
A	the protein up
D	yeah
E	is that really bad to eat?
A	it stops you snacking
B	yeah it is
unknown_female	yeah
E	cos I'm just looking at that and I I can't read any of it

C	it's like the Jamaica Inn but visualised
E	I can't read any of it
D	oh my god
B	it's more him with the diamond glasses
A	they had some manager's specials on as well when they have like steak and chips for six pounds
C	steak and chips is on the special?
B	right oh is it?
A	there's on the bar there were manager's specials but it think it was just steak and chips was six I think
E	right
A	and fish and chips was four
E	right
A	and there was something else but I can't remember
E	that's good
A	so if you pop down to the bar you can have a look
C	I dunno there's just the steak here
A	and it's probably not the best thing to have
B	yeah
A	how do you cremate your steak?
unknown_female	she does
A	why? you're ruining it
B	because I can't eat it any other way
A	it's like eating an old boot
D	that's what she likes isn't it?
A	absolutely ruins it
D	look I have got mine it's under the light here
B	yeah we're not under any light at all

A	I think I just pick it up from wherever I am
D	yeah
A	and I haven't really picked up any
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks their accent is unchanging.	Contradiction
D	yeah
A	mm

E	yeah?
D	and she said they're gonna buy like put two pounds in a week blah-de-blah-de-blah and week five she said something she had last time she went I had salad with salmon and green beans and six roast potatoes
B	because they're putting in two quid a a week and when they get enough they're gonna buy a
E	well that's a meal
B	a spa a spa day treatment and whoever wins the weigh-in on that night when they've got it gets that
B	so that's the incentive
