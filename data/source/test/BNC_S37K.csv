B	on a young girl actor
A	true
C	mm
A	okay

C	I don't understand cool I'm sorry but
A	no?
C	mm

A	well I've never done it
B	it's never gonna  It's never gonna  happen
A	so why specifically?

A	well this is quite unlikely
B	generally we only see each other
C	mm
B	at family events
A	mm
C	erm
A	yeah your family's different Peter
C	no
B	his family's different in one direction my family is different in another direction
A	fair enough
B	another direction
C	fundamental law relatives who don't see each other get together don't like each other so you need to drink
A	I don't think
B	maybe it's  Maybe it's  because of my relatives like each other that we don't have to
C	yeah
A	yours are more
C	liar
A	yours are more spread out though
B	yeah
A	intercontinental
B	oh
A	intercontinental relations

A	oh sorry
C	we're not in continental Europe
B	but
C	we're extra continental Europe
B	erm
A	international
B	no
A	yeah I mean what tends to happen is you know when we were little we used to spend quite a lot of time just us me and my sister and my cousins
B	mm hm
A	over the traditional they would go out in
B	are you similar age?
A	erm quite similar so
B	eh hmm
A	but it's kind of a nice progression of as in me and
B	I know
A	erm but erm so yeah we always used to kind of hang out together as kids
B	so
A	oh right
B	I can't remember I've lost track of what what age my my eldest cousin is but right eh well into his forties

C	well given that your parents are pretty old that makes sense
A	did they have older siblings? Like?
B	erm well my dad's little sister
A	okay
B	erm is the mother of the cousins who are in the middle
A	okay
B	mm
A	mm
B	enough to have have significant impact on

A	so so kinda the same age as us basically
C	mm well the same age as me
A	not twenty-four quite yet but just essentially the same
C	school years
A	yeah
B	no
A	oh right
B	I mean this is
A	not a big
B	yeah
C	mm twenty-five twenty-three isn't as a big difference as say twenty-three twenty-one
A	yeah I'd agree with that
B	mm
A	well it's different situations in life cos twenty-one you're probably still at uni you know final year of uni it's a big difference whereas twenty-three twenty-five twenty-five
B	you're probably still unemployed
C	so a girl I was at school with went straight to uni did a three year geography degree at Nottingham
A	oh God
B	first job?
C	first non bar job
B	mm

C	but
B	mm
C	if that was her eh that was very very arrogant
A	so was it two

B	yeah
C	yeah two two vets
B	her with a first in theology
A	right

C	head of the Catholic Church in Scotland
[ANNOTATION]	Person C is saying something about shouting at a head of the church	Neutral
B	oh
A	is it
C	pretty obscene comments
B	yeah I know
A	he's been
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is gonna dance	Contradiction
C	I thought burn in hell was a very appropriate response
B	mm
C	my favourite thing is that he
C	fuck off and die you bigot
B	mm
A	it's alright
C	oh that's the badger
B	yeah
A	he's basically being an idiot
C	but the thing that really fucked me off is that erm
B	recently since he's been doing that it's been getting to the point where I'm really feeling like I have to apologise for being Catholic
B	do you even know how what the proportion of of liberal Catholics to?
A	no I don't actually
B	folks
B	I see this I keep a I don't know it
C	well no offense
B	so that many have
C	I think the proportion of practising Catholics is a separate issue
A	mm
B	also it depends how you define practising
C	regularly attending a religious institution
A	how regular is regular?
C	reasonable definition
B	how frequent is regular?
C	erm
B	I went last week
A	mm
C	that's cos I was at home and I still haven't  still haven't  gone anywhere in

A	mm
C	let's face it C of E isn't doing any better
A	no just saying
C	what with Archbishop of fuck me off Canterbury
A	mm
C	it's right and wrong
B	I think
C	yeah
C	after he came to Selwyn
B	yup
C	yeah
A	that's interesting
C	yup
B	his his
C	I really felt like asking him so
B	his attitude of tolerance is tolerance of intolerance
C	yeah
A	right
C	so I really felt like asking him so so there are a lot of people who think that eh so yeah someone who's black
A	mm
C	shouldn't be in the church
A	maybe to
C	I I so I actually said essentially well I personally feel that a white woman is far better able to be a bishop than a black man
A	what are your thoughts on that?
C	what do you say bitch? I'm sorry but that's just of all people he should be aware of what it is like to face that kind of attitude
A	yeah to face intolerance and prejudice
B	mm
C	yeah and yet what did he do about it? Fuck all
B	mm
A	very sad
C	but he he does as little as humanly possible without massively upsetting anyone
A	mm
C	mm
A	oh
B	supposed to be Obama's birth certificate
A	yeah

A	have you seen it? Ah God
A	erm
C	so he's chief of the police department

B	oh
A	mm
B	one of those
A	yeah
B	he was taught how to be a terrorist in Indonesia
C	but you know that he's one of the most hated Christians

A	yeah
C	cheap stuff
B	huh
C	isn't it?
B	it is
A	yeah that thing that is really bad
B	I I haven't looked into detail but yeah
C	it's amazing if you look at the erm American system of benefits though so you get unemployment benefits about three months or something and then nothing actually it might be six months
A	no I think it's is it not two years in a row?
B	no
C	no idea
B	I don't think it's that long
A	mm
B	but after which you are literally cut off with nothing
A	which is terrifying
C	and they  And they  wonder why people who have been unemployed for longer than the employed benefit lasts
B	turn to crime
A	yes
C	turn to crime and
[ANNOTATION]	The unemployment rate has reached 15% in England for 2005.	Neutral

A	mm
B	and they refused to abolish it and therefore wasn't allowed to join

C	incidentally erm despite the fact we've got someone trying to demolish our house at the front and turn it into a rubbish tip at the back
A	oh yeah
C	demolish at the back rubbish at the front for fuck's sake
A	some people live there have just dumped a lot of rubbish down the side of the car
C	stop whispering
A	get loads of boxes
C	so they got a car which is actually parked there illegally as in it's like got a flat tyre and
A	it's it's yeah
C	it looks ok it needs work but
A	it's got a flat tyre and its parked right up against the house in the main storage area
C	as in it's actually touching our house
A	and
C	which they cleared this weekend
A	like they've just dumped loads of rubbish which is just
C	well apparently it's now acceptable to dump their rubbish in front of our windows
A	it's not even their bloody parking space
C	it was on
A	oh that's a good idea
C	well I wouldn't start with it
C	mm
A	and people at the back
C	that's not the huge problem
A	the people in the back have driven into our wall and knocked like the corner of the drive up there
C	it would be
A	yeah sort of flat but quite big
C	well yeah sort of flat but that size and out the corner of our wall
A	but it's our wall
C	it's our fucking wall
A	it's our house
C	mm
A	well
C	by scraped

C	her wheel scraped it
A	and it went black yeah
C	and yeah there were few black marks on it
A	there was more damage to the car  There was more damage to the car  than to the wall
C	which is actually quite significant chunks of material that have come out and it's like
A	you can't do that
C	mm
A	stop destroying our house
C	do you want to pop the music back on?
A	yeah okay

A	oh it's erm yeah it's quite good
C	it's quite rare
A	it would've been dreadful after forty-four minutes
C	that's pretty standard for packs of different sizes
A	no it was sort of twenty minutes plus twelve to fifteen for each
C	oh
A	for medium
C	so on other news so yeah next weekend we've got a route idea
B	mm hm
C	so long the old railway line in Derbyshire something like eight miles out and presumably eight miles back

B	yeah
A	sound good?
C	mm
B	erm with timings and arrangements and so on I still don't know what my eh itinerary for the day before is

A	magic flute?
B	I know Mozart was a mason but
C	I'm positive about this
C	the erm

A	there you go
B	oh
C	that's the badger
C	you get to use it

B	well I'll be going to her play on Monday
A	eh huh
C	she's written it
A	eh
C	corpus playroom
A	pleasant
B	next week
C	corpus playroom
B	I'll have to eh look it up
C	I have the worst side of the week in history
A	I don't particularly like the Corpus Playroom actually
C	who actually thought that was a good idea?
A	it's novel but it's dull
C	hate to break it to art students novel doesn't not equal good necessarily
A	I don't know how
B	I don't know
C	the building must be over a hundred years presumably that particular room
B	well it dates back at least to when Stephen Fry was
B	when he eh he had his
A	latin
B	he he broke into uni theatre there
C	pity
B	you can see he erm and he wrote a  he wrote a  letter which was on the erm Corpus Playroom website I think
A	cool
C	writing about how he first came here so
A	eh
B	fuck off Mr Fry and die in a hole
[ANNOTATION]	Stephen Fry is not a good person.	Entailment
B	preferably with one of my knives stuck between your ribs
A	oh
B	he was so
A	it's it's called Latin or something for boys
C	I don't care he's still a shithole
A	it's it it plays Latin Latin with subtitles and something for boys
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is the only person who dislikes Stephen Fry.	Contradiction
B	what?
C	spanking for boys basically for fun
A	no
B	I believe I've heard of it
A	okay
B	it was put on at some point by someone
C	by students
A	by students
B	during my time at uni
A	history Boys was
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C also dislikes Stephen Fry.	Entailment
C	yes and Bennett is an appalling author
C	well he nearly put me in a coma often enough
A	no that's not a good enough reason not to like it
C	him
A	do what?
C	speaking
A	which ones? History Boys is really good
C	yes so you're impartial
A	he wasn't Matt Smith then he was just like a
B	so you're impartial
C	you want something the size of a VW golf and you want a Volvo then there you go
B	you weren't impressed on a technical level
B	oh you know world's first pedestrian air bag
C	okay I I must have skipped that bit
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A dislikes Stephen Fry.	Neutral
A	mm
B	the fact that it's now got the authentic braking facility that works up to forty-one miles an hour which will detect and prevent collision to or other vehicles or pedestrians
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C does not know anything about cars.	Contradiction
A	pretty good
B	in all urban environments
A	so you really can't really remember if you're trying to
C	so basically your car is liable to take control from you?
B	well I have certain issues with that yes
A	would be really funny in like a Hollywood film when they try and run someone down and the car brakes
B	well there should be some Horrible Bosses
A	that was quite funny actually
C	mm?
B	eh
A	in Horrible Bosses if they'd had automatic braking systems they had this really
C	horrible Bosses?
B	it's a film where three guys really hate their bosses and they're trying to kill them?
A	they decide they're going to kill them
C	mm
A	I wouldn't mind seeing that again
C	love film?
A	love film
C	that that doesn't impress you any of it?
B	mm
C	as in Volvo have announced that by twenty twenty it's their goal that no one will be killed or injured severely injured in or by a Volvo
A	an admirable goal
C	yeah
B	mm
C	I think so and they're well on the way to achieving it
A	mm
C	mm
B	mm
B	or as I like to call it Top Gear
A	amazing
B	eh
A	James May is definitely marry
B	yeah
C	really?
A	oh and tricky between the well I genuinely want to
C	I'd definitely avoid
A	well I would avoid it too but I'm not massively in to Richard Hammonds
C	and and also I don't yeah
B	oh and he said something rather interesting at the end of eth last episode which you weren't there for
A	who's that Clarkson or Hammond?
B	yes Clarkson
A	God he's such a dick
C	well no
B	I think his TV personality is such a dick
C	I don't know I disagree I think that it's a perfectly legitimate comment under the circumstances
A	I I'm just not sure I particularly want to snog either of them
C	mm
A	so either snog and marry
B	though we're agreed that you know James May is the marry marry one
A	yeah James May is definitely the marry one yeah
A	yeah
B	hello daughter at last
A	awkward
B	that would be awkward
C	I was just dream off with Sarah Millican
A	ah she's very good
B	it's not that fit
A	oh she's very good
C	she is
B	oh yeah she's brilliant
A	we need to get her Chatterbox DVD

A	oh I didn't know they had a series
C	Sarah Millican's television show it's called
A	nice
C	no?
A	perhaps she is
C	eh
A	it's quite close but it's not close enough
C	it's the right side of the Tyne
A	but it's so wrong
A	you don't need
C	what have you been drinking
B	so
B	you can finish my sherry if you like? Oh God
C	if you don't want it I will have it for you
B	I eh if you say
A	right
A	oh my God
C	now I'll have that sherry
A	gotta get that image out of your head
C	Sarah Millican being fingered by a gorilla
A	no
C	oh yes
A	that wasn't even that sounds like
C	yeah good point
A	I've actually never laughed so much
C	what?
A	you know I think I don't know if you were there
C	yes
A	it's always a good night
B	you should live in
A	yes we know
C	yes but then we wouldn't have this

A	very nice staff
B	oh I know her
A	yeah the blonde
B	well she's got a hat on
A	yeah okay
C	as you asking the question they'll go off and find out for you

B	ah you've received Cam?
C	I haven't

C	it's a really shit read
B	but erm
A	I don't know what's in it if you haven't
B	it's

C	the one on the back is ridiculously hench or fat I can't work out
A	probably hench
C	actually
B	that's blondie
C	they're all ridiculously hench or fat
B	she isn't ridiculously hench and she's not fat
A	hench
C	there are kind of and they've all got really bulging like over their tops there's a lot of bulging going on

C	that's not a massive
A	it's a really tight leotard that she's wearing
C	there there there
A	they're just big women
C	there there there there
A	but she is definitely she's definitely the hottest
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about her friends	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	from the back
C	erm yeah
A	well yeah
B	I'm not saying it could be
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about school	Contradiction
A	you know her from the front?
C	fair enough
A	it's a very weird advert
B	I have no idea
A	no one looks as if it's girls
[ANNOTATION]	it looks like boys	Contradiction
B	I'm just saying that's that's
A	oh right
B	last year
A	which supervision was it? Sorry you did probably say that
B	oh must be geo tech
A	I like her
B	yeah?
A	I believe the one we didn't have in college

A	okay
B	you don't have supervisions whatsoever
A	oh yeah
B	third year? Yeah
A	oh right
B	she's eh living and working in Birmingham
A	Birmingham
B	she's not a prospect I think
A	oh right
B	she's been with the same guy all the time that I've known her
C	well he can be killed?
A	how do you know? He might actually be a superhero
C	yeah
A	Cos then the films would be boring
C	yeah true
B	so they've got to be yeah
C	Metro man in
A	Metro man
C	it's like the villains in what?
A	the the aliens in War of the Worlds
B	Metro city
C	what?
A	in erm there's Metro man and there there's the other villain
B	tighten
A	tighten
A	so good
B	I I love the
A	yeah
B	it's kind of it's got subtle things that not everybody picks on the first time
A	yeah
C	incidentally on a slight change of topic but I think I should go there before I completely forget
A	ah ha
B	mm
A	rose doesn't respond to emails
C	why did you last speak to her?
B	speak
C	well no communicate
A	when did you last know she was alive?
B	I'd have to check my Skype logs erm
B	weeks probably
A	I emailed her a week ago
C	yeah cos I emailed her respectively two weeks and three weeks ago
A	mm
C	and that's not typical
A	she's not responsive
C	well she's bad but she's not that bad as in you normally it takes two emails to get a response
A	normally she
B	she's a funny one that lass
A	I'm trying to get her to commit to a holiday date
A	Holiday dates
C	we were thinking it might be nice to actually go away at some point in the moderately near future
B	like?
A	we don't have any plans
C	well like a month or so cos
A	yes are you looking at me? And well there's this cottage in Wales
C	are you looking at me punk?
A	yes
C	there is this cottage in Wales which has attractions as in it is essentially five star but is only five hundred pounds per week at any time of the year
A	it's a very nice area
C	so that has the attraction it's very cheap
B	on on the list for which we are
A	we are on the special list
B	no
A	on the
B	Don't want to end the sentence on a proposition
A	on the
C	we are on this list
B	okay
A	yeah that works
C	but the point being the location is
B	I'm so annoyed that my godmother sold their farm house in Burgundy
A	mm
B	that was gonna be you know
A	aw
B	not any more
C	to continue with this thread
A	mm
C	the
A	definitely room for four
C	well there's four beds but there's also space for other sleeping bags and stuff I'm sure they wouldn't object
B	or we can share beds
C	there's three beds
B	where in Wales?
C	Mid Wales
B	near which mountains?
C	eh hang on it would be erm
B	yeah
C	so it starts with G
A	gairngorms
C	no
A	I was joking
C	so it's the mountains that go up half way through
B	not
C	no
B	okay I don't know what that is then
A	it's like half way up
B	I was expecting like Brecon or Snowdonia
C	no
B	mm mm
C	starting about here going upwards
B	yeah
C	there's a gap
B	snowdonia being near the top
C	yeah they end in Snowdonia but they go pretty much the entire length
A	but it's kind of on the coast so there's some nice views of cliffs and things
C	there's tonnes of nice beaches lots of nice things to do
B	oh so near
C	no sorry
C	yeah in Cardigan Bay
A	and there's no restaurants so you don't go out you just stay in and cook
B	yay
A	yay
C	but this is a trip
A	exactly so
C	so yeah who's eh leading idea? Erm other ideas up north in Scotland
C	erm that eh question getting a train to Newcastle hiring a car at Newcastle and driving
A	it's really different
C	it's very different
A	I recommend the highlands
C	it's very exotic as in it's not like Scotland as you know it
A	insane hills and white beaches and it's really cool
C	yeah like I said exotic is a good word
B	sounds good
C	nice cheap cottage because it's so far it's so remote it's not expensive
A	do you want to sit on a chair? You're allowed it's fine
B	I want to lie down
C	we're going to have cheese and biscuits later
B	sounds good
C	erm so at most
A	so it's yeah
C	at most it would be five hundred quid
B	I have an outing tomorrow morning
A	ooh
A	you have work tomorrow morning
A	F T B C
C	anyway can I finish please?
A	sorry
C	erm so again there's not a lot to do that involves money which is good
A	beaches
C	boozing inside erm but the problem is that you have to drive a long way to get anywhere
A	yeah that's true whereas if you were in Wales
C	ah but that said it is proportionally a lot cheaper and you don't spend anything out
A	yeah
C	erm then another option is eh
A	Northumberland?
C	no
A	the other one?
C	you've been there
A	oh there? Yeah
C	what's it's called
A	erm
C	which is near Carlisle so it's kind of other side of the country but at my parents' kind of level
C	but what they've got is some very
B	I don't know where Carlisle is
C	which is good because it's in a sort of striking distance of the Lakes Northumberland Dumfries and Galloway and the Pennines
A	it's close  it's close  to all the highlights basically
C	yeah it's basically a literal epicentre to get to anywhere decent
B	I wouldn't sit in and watch TV up there
C	key thing
B	what one each?
A	that would be good yeah
C	well the big cottages do
A	which has attractions
C	so probably in eth summer you'd be looking at about a grand a week
A	which is
C	again not a huge amount
A	but it's a lot more than
B	it is when it's
A	because of the
B	more than five per cent of your annual salary before tax
C	yeah but you don't pay that each
B	oh
A	not a grand each
B	of course of course
A	we're not suggesting this
C	so it's not in fact six grand a week
B	right okay
C	that would be pushing it
A	that would be pushing it
C	yeah so
A	so yeah
C	things
A	all the things
C	so you'd spend a lot less fuel
A	mm
A	but it's kind of totting it up anyway I guess?
C	but none of these options are expensive
B	yeah
A	it is always
C	and again none of these options are particularly expensive because that's you know you're not going to spend anything in bars or restaurants you're just going to buy cheap booze and eh
A	and cheap food
C	so those are my three leading ideas at the moment
A	like
C	yep
A	they're not that cheap
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B will not buy expensive food.	Entailment
C	well they're quite fun and but you have free use of a very nice pool and sauna and Jacuzzi on site and gym
A	but it's not that cheap and they are basically caravans
B	I doubt
C	but you are on the coast
A	you are on the coast
B	I would go away to use a
C	they're not caravans they're permanent
A	mm
C	no
A	okay
C	they're the same size
A	yeah exactly and that didn't sound massive
B	it will be cosy
[ANNOTATION]	The pool is not free of charge to use.	Contradiction
A	yeah
C	yeah I
A	is that good or bad I'm not sure if you're being sentimental?
C	but it's right on the coast
A	as it comes
B	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The sunsets in that coast are very romantic.	Neutral
C	so anyway what are your thoughts on those options?
B	erm
C	any preferences?
B	erm
A	Carlisle
A	yeah
C	okay
B	oh no
C	okay Wales Ullapool near Carlisle middle of Northumberland and Northumberland coast
A	that whole thing
B	not so keen on eh the latter
C	okay of the other four any order of preference?
C	so any order of preference in the other four?
B	I'm thinking
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B hasn't made his/her mind concerning the coast choice yet.	Entailment
B	I mean you tempted me slightly by the eh exotic exotity
B	no I was going to say
A	exoticity
B	yes that's it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has been to many exotic places so far.	Neutral
C	of Ullapool
A	yes
C	they're not mutually exclusive
B	depends how much  how much  I can
C	well what plans do you have?
B	erm first week of
[ANNOTATION]	Speakers will be in Ullapool in the last week of a month.	Contradiction
A	can I take your plate sir?
B	yes thank you
C	mm
B	stretchies
C	first week of?
B	erm oh no last week of August I'm going my parents and my brother to walking in
C	that's two weeks?
B	yeah
C	how much leave have you got?
B	well I've got thirty days including compulsory holiday which includes the eight
A	mm
B	erm so
A	so that's ten used?
B	yeah
A	right
B	that don't aren't already covered
C	that that's
B	should have had the foresight to have leave
