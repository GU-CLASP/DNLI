B	aye so that erm
A	yeah yeah
B	erm
A	very good yes
B	I
A	yeah yeah
B	even the Pole To Pole had that kind of
A	yeah
B	just him
A	yeah
B	okay it's the Hemingway theme but
A	yeah yeah I I found it interesting cos I didn't know much that much about Hemingway so
B	alright
A	found it really interesting to find out I didn't realise he was so well travelled and that he'd been so many places and you know fought in the wars and and all that and I was like I really enjoyed it
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I mean
B	it's good
A	you know? his I hadn't really put it all together his time in Spain and
B	yeah
A	didn't even know he'd been to France to be honest
B	no
A	aha
B	cos that bit
A	yeah
B	I hadn't really read much about
A	yeah yeah
B	and erm
A	yeah? aye aye
B	yeah kinda under under the line kinda place yeah
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mm mm
B	really
A	yeah
B	yeah America as you think of it erm
A	no no
B	it seemed just a bit marginalised and a bit kind of forgotten about
A	yes
B	I dunno if it still is or maybe it's been redeveloped since they did cos it's it's
A	yeah
B	like fifteen years old that book isn't it?
A	but maybe that's what he liked though eh? because then when he went to visit Montana in the end? it was just middle of nowhere
B	bit too
A	middle of nowhere stuff you know so
B	yeah
A	not read
B	like I said about Sahara
A	yeah of course
B	on my old haunt
A	of course
B	well he's on when he's
A	right I'll remember that
B	and erm
A	aha
B	such a mix of cultures going from
A	yeah
B	he's I think he starts in Afghanistan
A	right
B	then he starts to rise in the Hindu Kush and stuff like that
A	aha
B	and then he ends in Bangladesh doesn't he? like in the in the basin
A	ah
B	er the Bay Of Bengal or something isn't it?
A	right
B	so er aye that's that's very very good
A	I look forward to that one yeah yeah
B	er have have you seen the TV series?
A	not well not for those two but for the
A	mm mm
B	the Himalaya one just cos it's
A	mm
B	and
A	right
B	you think of it as a short cut well it's just a mountain range but it's not really it's like a massive
A	yeah huge
B	thing er
A	like Sahara I guess
B	I don't think he goes to Bhutan in that
A	oh right?
B	cos Bhutan would be a good one
A	maybe it's closed off
B	well it is they they
A	aha
B	who'd been in Bhutan
A	mm mm
B	and I remember like nobody at the time had that idea and
A	right
B	of course he came in and gave a presentation about it
A	oh what was that an exchange
B	no no he he was Scottish
A	right aha
B	but he'd lived in Bhutan for a year
A	right
B	and erm
A	jesus
B	cos there was that big controversy I think when Prince Charles took his entourage and like
A	and that was it? for the year?
B	well they kind of
A	oh aye oh aye
B	but there is erm
A	I can imagine
B	but there is a I was reading something about Bhutan having like
A	right
B	I can't remember if the book covers it or not
A	oh that sounds good
B	yeah
A	that sounds good
B	yeah yeah
A	for nothing
B	seriously yeah yeah just like sky scrapers
A	but then no
A	no one lives in them
B	yeah
A	they have
B	that that's that that's what happened on the edge of
A	right
B	where erm
A	no
B	beautiful flowers
B	in in the central reservation
A	yeah
B	erm
A	yeah
B	going up and down
B	within a three
A	right
B	I dunno
A	but no one
B	well er
A	d'you think they can keep that up then because is it not? are they not starting to have some sort of difficulties now?
B	I think that there's a I think there's a lot of corruption in the in the in the building industry which is what keeps it going
A	mm mm mm mm
A	they've obviously got fantastic infrastructure eh but
B	yeah yeah
A	now now the erm
B	yeah I think it takes time it takes time doesn't it?
A	mm mm
B	they take five ten twenty to build up so who knows?
A	yeah yeah
B	and then you've got the erm
A	yeah yeah
B	erm Sahara's a good one
A	mm mm
B	I need to read that New Europe cos that's the one I never
A	aye
B	got to see properly
A	that was good
B	Eastern Europe
A	yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
B	Romania Croatia stuff like that
A	yeah
B	did you see any of those Michael Portillo train journey
A	I've seen the odd one not the series but I've seen the odd one yeah yeah he's quite good
B	when he goes to Europe?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah he's he's he's
A	but he's quite good at it so
B	got bit of panache
A	must be better that than he is at politics or was at politics seen as he got
A	yes
B	did he go back after that or was that him?
A	er
B	cos he's been on that politics show for years
A	er
B	yeah yeah like
B	I dunno almost
A	yes
B	he did er Derry To Kerry
A	aye he did a couple of them and presumably they liked the idea
B	onto the onto the Kyle of Lochalsh or
A	yes
B	something like that
A	but then you said they wanted someone else to do the Palin role first but he turned it down
B	it was originally gonna be Alan Whicker eh?
A	right
B	and then it was another guy and he was third choice or fourth choice or
A	right
B	something like that
A	it's amazing to think eh it could've been someone else
A	who knows what would've happened so
B	no
A	it's filled a hole for him in his career anyway
B	yeah
A	cos I never saw him in his
B	did you have a look at the the
A	yeah yeah I've not read it yet it's on my
B	yeah
A	it's on my shelf
B	well this is it you gotta take the time to digest it all eh?
B	yeah well you gave me that one on Saturday but
A	yeah yeah
B	erm I'm I'm
A	what book's that?
B	erm
A	ah
B	yeah
A	you're gonna become a Buddhist?
B	mm
A	is that not quite full-on?
B	yeah
A	you're like giving up drinking and food and stuff
B	well not all food
A	not all food
B	I've kinda become semi vegetarian eh
B	like I
A	mm mm
B	maybe maybe once a week or something yeah but like erm I don't know
A	someone at work saw the salad I was eating and said where's the meat? how can you eat it without the meat?
B	er
A	so
B	I don't miss it eh
A	well
B	no you get enough nutrients elsewhere as long as you're eating eggs and
A	yeah yeah
B	getting the protein and stuff
A	well aye
B	chopped up
A	chopped up bit of tomato bit of egg
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
A	oh really? how so?
B	I just prefer the taste eh?
B	like
A	mm
B	if if you have a steak I mean?
A	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
B	erm but if if you eat fish
A	mm
B	aye but you don't have to eat until you're heavy
A	yeah
B	there's a difference isn't there?
A	aye absolutely
B	you could probably finish
A	absolutely
B	like most meals you could probably stop three quarters of the way through but like
A	I'm fine
B	there's always that thing it's it's on my plate
A	yeah I better eat it oh I did that tonight I probably
B	it's there
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about food	Entailment
A	I'll finish it yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	there's a lot of that erm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about something is finish	Entailment
B	it's up to you
A	you take what you want so if you want more meat you have it
B	aye so it's that thing if it's like
A	yeah yeah
B	and take too much
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about meat	Neutral
B	especially
A	yeah yeah
B	it's just heavy cos of the cream and bacon and stuff
B	yeah
A	so
B	ah it's alright took you two days?
A	yes
B	no erm
A	dunno if I could give up meat
A	good on you though
B	and erm the
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	and all that
B	yeah
A	all that malarkey
B	but it does work
A	surely it requires discipline?
B	yeah
A	I'm not gonna be a Buddhist
B	yeah so
A	that's like going to the gym
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
A	cos can you both? can you can one of you be a Buddhist and the other one not or?
B	yeah yeah mm
A	d'you reckon?
B	I think she she finds it more difficult not to kill mosquitoes when we're in China but
A	oh really? so you try not to kill animals? but could you like?
B	but I've been doing that for a long time as I've
A	yeah
B	like erm
A	yeah
B	I learned that from
A	yeah yeah
B	he erm
A	yeah
B	you know? are a pain
A	but are you
B	you can try you just try and get rid of negative thoughts yeah
A	really?
B	that's that's
A	but
B	on a practical level
A	but you love your own team
B	yeah that that that's fair enough but I mean that that's different as long as you control it within that
A	yeah yeah
B	I dunno we'll see but yeah I see that that that
A	all
A	someone's annoying you at work or at home you have to just be like
B	yeah
A	that sort of thing
B	but that that that's not just a Buddhist thing that's that's a
A	mm
B	that's a good attitude in general isn't it? walk
A	yeah yeah
B	a mile in the other person's shoes
A	get on with it
A	yeah
B	so
B	we'll see what happens
A	aye interesting though
B	er
A	right
B	I haven't been able to pick up that Scottish football one
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah the Buddhism one's quite a heavy one eh it's over a thousand pages
A	how long will that take you to read then?
B	I'm about well I've been I've got three four hundred in
A	got plenty of time to read
B	no it's just I go to bed and I
A	right
B	and fire through with it
A	right
B	this new job it's been easier to
A	right
B	cos I don't have to prepare lessons or anything so
A	ah right
B	ah my eyes start to get heavy after after a few pages aye
B	and quite often I'll I'll I'll
A	yeah yeah
B	and then
A	don't know where you don't know where you are yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	no I know that feeling
B	I don't I don't like the new touchscreen Kindle eh I I miss my old one
A	oh really?
B	ah
A	ah what were there? buttons at the side?
B	yeah
A	that's what I've got the buttons at the side
B	I prefer that one eh
A	right
B	when I was in Spain last year
A	aye
B	erm
A	the old one aye yeah yeah you
B	whereas with the touchscreen
A	aye
B	different gestures on the screen so if you swipe
A	right
B	to the left or
B	or if you're touching the top third of the screen
A	so it's usual they try and make something
B	well it's it it's probably sleeker eh but I did prefer the old one
A	there's unintended consequences
B	so that's
A	aye
B	I
A	well it's the same thing isn't it but just?
B	different brand
A	a different
B	but yeah access to a different store isn't it?
A	yes I don't even know what their store
B	they're they're they're pushed by WHSmith so
A	right
B	yeah
A	so they've just thrown their lot behind
B	makes sense though eh? if you can't beat them
A	yeah so they must make
B	yeah but
A	did you hear they the
B	mm
A	they had their worst year like
B	what the the e-reader or the tablet?
A	in ages
B	saturation
A	the point where
B	yeah
A	aren't feeling the need to upgrade to the latest e-reader
B	no it's the it's not like a an Ipad or something which gets faster I mean there's only so many things that a book can do
A	yeah
B	broke when I first moved to
A	mm mm
B	so
A	mm mm
B	between me breaking that one and getting a new one and it was only because I couldn't think of anything else to get from my mum for Christmas
A	right
B	said what d'you want? what d'you want? what d'you want?
A	get that
B	no cos it makes no
A	I mean I don't even
B	makes no difference
A	I don't even know if you transfer your books over
B	yeah
A	no idea
B	yeah all all the same books are available
A	right so if I've got
B	yeah
A	I get the a new Kindle all the books are there again?
B	yeah yeah
A	right
B	yeah they're in the cloud and you just download them as as
A	so they're aye so they're mine so I'm buying the
B	yeah
B	er in the same way that you can download the app to a phone and you can get the same book
B	I mean Ipad or
A	of course of course aye
A	I quite often have it on
B	yeah
A	that I've not brought
B	yeah that's that's that's the idea is that
[ANNOTATION]	There is a space of 60GB in the cloud.	Neutral
A	yeah yeah
B	it's a mobile library which
A	yeah yeah
B	in the modern world cos
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yes aye
B	I don't think I'll ever lose that because you cannot share Kindle books that's that's a problem
A	no you're right yeah yeah like that Scottish football book pass it round people and
B	mm I don't know maybe there is a system I dunno
[ANNOTATION]	The Kindle device is a bit expensive.	Neutral
A	well there's a lending library a Kindle lending library that you
B	but I don't understand how that works
A	if you're an Amazon
B	yeah so you get you get
[ANNOTATION]	Kindle was produced by Amazon.	Neutral
A	eighty quid? eighty quid a year to get Prime isn't it?
B	and like you can just get books for as long as you want?
A	well
B	or you
A	yeah I think you basically
B	well the cost
A	they'd only get say three weeks to read it
B	well eighty quid a year you know?
A	yeah and then after
A	afterwards it wouldn't be on your device as far as I know once you hand it back
B	well that's it
A	it just works like a library
[ANNOTATION]	The borrowed book remains in the personal kindle for life.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	you've got it
B	twenty-first century Tory libraries
A	no aye you pay for it yeah yeah you pay for them
A	see that's though that's it I still use libraries for for wee books so Irvine Welsh has got a book out
[ANNOTATION]	It is not expensive to borrow e-books.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	copy of this when you've found it and
B	or or you'd have to pay
A	aye eight quid
B	eight quid for a paperback or twenty quid for a hardback or
A	I I had a look at the
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	There is not difference between paper covered books and hardback when it comes to price.	Contradiction
A	so if I wanna read that pretty quick
B	fair enough
