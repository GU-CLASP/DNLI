B	ah okay let's discuss eh let's discuss our
A	life
B	yeah no no okay eh other teachers
A	you what did you want to be as a child?
B	a barrister I mean
A	no no no no I mean as a child not like as a you weren't born a four-year-old
A	fine okay watch this right when you were the youngest you know okay obviously football it's football alright obviously
B	I didn't care yeah football
B	I didn't I wanted to be eh I didn't want to be I didn't want to be an astronaut or a firefighter or a
A	I did no not firefighter I didn't want to be anything where I had to probably die
B	yeah
A	I I and I and back then I didn't realise that there were so many failed Apollo missions
B	yeah
A	before they actually got to space
B	ah no not Apollo erm
A	no cos no one tells you what death is
B	I know exactly
A	no one tells you you're going to die in like
B	we don't have as much of a regard for death as did you ever? oh a swear word
A	yeah you know? you know that everyone grows up at some point yeah?
B	yeah
A	I'm at that phase where I'm not grown up yet I still want to be something like an astronaut or something
B	yeah yeah but to become an astronaut that would require
A	physics degree yeah
B	maybe a physics degree but do you think working from an early age? to as as in commit to an
A	well erm
B	I don't I don't know
A	Neil Neil Armstrong right?
B	yeah Neil Armstrong
A	erm he
B	oh yeah
A	he flew erm air bombing missions in a in a the Korean War
B	did he?
A	yeah he
B	oh shit
A	yeah he he he had like a crap load of successful er missions in Korean War
B	yeah
A	and after that cos he was so great
B	yeah
A	erm that you know the NASA recruited him because he was the best pilot they could find
B	damn so he he he he but did he have a physics degree before he became a a pilot?
A	no he he was part of the air force
B	damn
A	I guess now you do because if you there's there's a finite
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	maybe not cos their rocket blew up
B	they still don't I know that I'm not
A	no no no that was a private company that was a private company
B	was it really? oh okay
A	yeah NASA know NASA know how to get people to space
B	I understand
A	yeah yeah that's why they need private companies
B	that's why oh alright investment
A	and
B	that's what we should be investing in like er ah I wish I had the statistics on erm on America's use of er
A	yeah like you realise they yeah but their military invented duct tape Velcro?
B	did it?
B	we invented the jet we gave them the jet after World War Two apparently
B	yeah yeah
A	and erm
B	he was British
A	yeah he was British but er and er this started at like thirty-nine right?
B	yeah yeah
A	and and he he campaigned for years and years and years trying to get his idea picked up by the military
B	yeah yeah
A	it wouldn't have it it wasn't until like after the the er Second World War that that
B	yeah yeah
A	and then they decided to take his idea
B	yeah I see well the whole world steals for for everyone's own please
A	yeah yeah it's like erm yeah in in king James' time isn't it? monopolies were always people that invented stuff
B	yeah
A	I guess that I
A	because if you you were the first person
[ANNOTATION]	Person a is going to dance	Contradiction
B	it's like a patent
A	yeah no no it's not like a patent because you can you can like patent say you invented the hoover tomorrow yeah?
B	yeah
A	and the hoover hadn't been invented you invent the hoover you can't patent the hoover
B	yeah
A	you can patent the the things that you make the hoover out of and the systems you use
B	oh right right
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agree with Person A that he should patent his inventions	Neutral
A	but you can't patent the hoover that means that if if if I come tomorrow or the day after and I make a a
B	right yeah
A	a vacuum
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that the one that is like vacuum is not the an invention	Entailment
B	yeah
A	cleaner and but it uses different parts
B	yeah
B	right right right
A	so
B	so it that's an issue with the patent though like
A	no it's not well because you
B	that they're not specific enough or they're not
B	yeah yeah that's good yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B think he need some more specific for inventions	Entailment
A	so so if you invented the computer say as Alan Turing did in eh World War Two
B	yeah
A	he you should have ah undisputed rights to every single computer
B	yeah okay
A	and then there's the flip side of that that people say that that's anti-capitalistic whereas that you have a then have a situation where you have a monopoly
B	yeah
A	where erm whereby one person controls the complete market share
B	right right
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agree that he should find the place that they control all the market	Entailment
B	yeah it's it's it's it's eh so it's like but that I think the issue with patents is that they they hinder the progress of anything creative
A	no patents don't monopolies do
B	or
A	that's that's that's that was their original argument against monopolies because
B	yeah monopolies yeah okay monopolies existed since seventeen hundreds in
A	I mean arguably they still do because
B	yeah
A	you have like oil and gas monopolies
B	right right yeah yeah yeah that that
A	in the end big six six energy companies
B	yeah
A	it's weird how none of their prices ever drop and they all move it up at the same time
B	yeah I know I know that's just competition with allies though
A	yeah
A	by by definition if you're controlling market that makes it monopoly
B	yeah yeah I see that
A	so that's the
B	yeah
A	you would you could get like
B	yeah
A	and I think
B	well okay
A	but on the flip side people that erm eh seek to monopolise a market that can't it's it's like like everything it's nearly impossible to strike up a perfect balance
B	yeah but just because you invent something
A	yeah
B	erm just because eh what was I saying? erm just because you're inventing erm yeah just because you manage to invent something you you said they should be protected more
A	yeah
B	doesn't that theoretically mean that in like fifty years or a hundred years or there's going to be a point where it's becoming eh a a a less likely or a smaller chance that you're going to create something then isn't that? I mean isn't that unfair? why don't we reward people for?
A	no but I know that
B	yeah
A	with a risk of becoming a billionaire or you you can create an amazing product and lose get get absolutely nothing
B	yeah
A	whereas
B	yeah
A	that you would not get nothing out of inventing something
B	yeah
A	more people would you know quit their day job and and pursue you know trying to make something you know
B	and we shouldn't be
B	I mean because because
A	cos every right everything
B	and inventions are so they're so scarce now even in the past they were so scarce
A	exactly that's the issue
B	ah oh no no no no no no I think I think we're over-inspiring I'm saying scarce I'm saying scarce as in it's hard to create something that is original and can be marketed
B	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	but a lot of them don't have
B	no
A	and the the second thing which is an issue you know we're basically talking about is they they're they're not monetarily sustainable
B	yeah but you don't want to be encouraging people all these people to quit their day jobs for a cause that is very
A	right you got alright look at the unemployment yeah?
B	yeah
A	if more people quit their jobs and went into you're getting more people do the Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak deal or a Bill Gates
B	that was so rare that's mostly with like innovative speakers
A	that's so rare because not not that many people are trying it
B	no some people how many?
A	you you realise that there's a certain probability something's going to happen
[ANNOTATION]	There is no change something will happen.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	the more times you you test that
B	yeah
A	the more like the more results you're likely to have
B	yeah yeah
A	Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak yeah?
B	yeah
A	they set up a business in their garage
B	yeah
A	who does that now? who sets up a business in their garage?
[ANNOTATION]	Jobs and Wozniak set up a business in their mom's basement.	Contradiction
B	people try people
A	yeah
B	and yet they can't make money out of it they get no success it's impossible
A	that's the issue they don't make money out of it we need to help them make financially sustainable
A	yeah but
B	yeah
A	the profit you make isn't going into the pockets of the person that owns the company if you
B	yeah
A	you
B	how hard is? yeah
A	because it doesn't matter if the
B	yeah
A	because at the end of the day you're still getting paid
[ANNOTATION]	Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak worked together.	Entailment
B	but they're going to be making a loss as in how hard is it to be freelance? or or or or self-employed and make money?
A	it is hard we we need to help them because
B	yeah
A	at the end of the day we we have a you you look at the computing sector or the gaming sector
B	yeah
A	erm the movie sector we are miles behind the likes of America and China
B	yeah
A	eh and even India right?
B	yeah
A	we are miles behind because people don't
B	but look what that's resulted in
[ANNOTATION]	Developers and self-employed people don't get much help here.	Entailment
A	you know that's not resulted in anything good because at the end of the day you look at it a mountain of things that erm America and China will invent yeah?
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	China invented that radio thing that you can put in the shower.	Neutral
A	they're pushing for why are all the big like mobile
B	we
A	the the way of thinking that well why? why let? why try and work hard and invent something else
B	yeah
A	it doesn't matter that cos China are going to undercut us and we have America over there we have India with a a
B	yeah I mean but you don't want to
A	that's the mentality as much as anything else
[ANNOTATION]	China has not invented anything yet.	Contradiction
B	I think it's as much to do with the work ethic as it is has to do with encouraging people to make inventions and the
A	yeah I know but the the point is that they invested in their people
B	yeah by forcing them to work by controlling them by giving them hard hours
A	I mean yeah I know but
B	yeah okay
A	obviously they're still it's not perfect you still have a a communist regime and you can't talk out against it
B	yeah
A	you have the Hong Kong umbrella riots
B	yeah yeah
A	but but the point is there's they there's been you've seen a stark amount of investment from erm you know communist regime
B	yeah yeah
A	industrialise you know agriculture
B	yeah
A	there there's now no more of that as compared to erm we have erm now er a a market where we can start selling people stuff to consumers we can we can you know?
B	yeah
A	work that way and that's what they try and do they're investing that way that's why their er the
B	yeah we do
A	erm I don't one of the most
A	Chinese company they invent it they make it cheap
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it's all about trying to now change from like industry to try and make stuff that the consumer
B	innovative yeah yeah but they do I mean they do that well I guess Japan does it in a similar way but they don't have
A	well
B	they're they're just innovative in everything they do
A	I know but their their issue is that they don't spend enough money
B	yeah okay but they're they're not in as debt as bloody Britain or America
A	like that's why they they no well China are in a massive amount of debt
B	or China are
A	China are in a
B	China's growing though China is sustainable
A	yeah I know that's the difference the China's debt in being investment
B	yeah
A	they they unlike us we we we
B	yeah
A	has been through erm investing in their er in their country and in their people in their new innovation
B	we the NHS is investing in our people maybe not fundamentally or ideologically but healthcare is better erm er school education
A	education is a
B	yeah
A	every country will have these costs right?
B	yeah
A	unless you're America and you try and do an ObamaCare system
B	yeah ObamaCare
A	okay? but everything will have a set amount of cost what China
B	yeah
A	that you spend on education and healthcare and they've got the the best that they can possibly get even though they have a billion people
B	yeah
A	and it must be hard to
B	yeah
A	they've managed to do that whilst also with the surplus money they've had
B	yeah
A	they've invested it
B	they have and they've done that well yeah
B	yeah
A	they they wasted the
B	yeah
A	they
B	yeah
A	and then a massive windfall of millions and they did not invest it correctly
B	so so you think it's it
A	yeah by
B	for yeah yeah that's true alright I got to go yeah?
