A	she's not drinking her camomile tea she's just chewing the top
A	well I can't remember
B	mm
A	but I know the wisdom teeth kill
B	yeah but why would it help to put pressure on it?
A	it helps them break the gum which is why erm my mum said erm make some dry biscuit things like really hard biscuits for them to chew on to break the gum literally
B	yeah
A	to help the tooth through must really hurt
B	mm
A	wisdom teeth really hurt don't they?
B	mm
A	oh actually I think I've only got one but the others keep pretending to grow and that hurts enough
B	I don't know if I've got
A	I've got one I need it out
B	really?
A	yeah I'm gonna go
B	that's quite a big er operation
A	it's er it's going it's er
B	mm
A	it feels like it doesn't belong
A	what? I'm not supposed to be wise she likes her camomile tea look
B	mm
A	do you like it?
B	mm
A	this is only camomile tea's only a hint of flavour
B	mm yeah it's not strong is it?
A	mm
B	what about marshmallow tea? is she allowed that?
A	I don't know if people have er allergies to that and do you know ever since we had that marshmallow tea? that was lovely wasn't it?
B	mm
A	erm I haven't seen it sold anywhere
B	where did you get it from?
A	we got it from where were we living? it was a little shop that suddenly had all these weird fruit teas
B	was it here?
A	no not here
B	oh she
A	you look cute in your little Labyrinth outfit
B	was it
B	mm?
B	it wasn't
A	it really was ages ago it was
B	mm
A	I liked it I'd like to get it again I wonder if they've got it in that foreign shop cos they had all sorts of stuff didn't they? but I just didn't spend I felt quite rushed
B	mm
A	with just one hour to nip round wasn't kind of browsing
B	well it took us an hour as well
A	yeah well we weren't browsing
B	only got there with a few minutes to spare
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and I'm sure they do the flowers for camomile at the supermarket but then I bought the wrong ones last time that look exactly the same as a camomile flower
B	mm
A	er so
B	so what could we use instead of Bonjela?
A	I don't know
B	cos that's just aniseed isn't it?
A	cloves
B	cloves?
A	cloves and aniseed but it's in a really minute quantity I'm guessing I don't really know what they put in Bonjela but I know that if you put clove when er we when your teeth come through when you're a bit older I remember we I put clove oil on but it's so strong that a baby can't have that can it?
B	mm
A	don't think
B	don't know
A	let me ask the girls they've all they've got four-month-old babies and the their teeth have already come through let me ask them what they've got
B	mm
A	whether they've got anything spare I'll put it on that
A	you can't just put like a comment
A	like when I was telling people where their that that the nurse told us you couldn't get vitamin D only in the hospital and stuff but that but then they just ignore me and talk between themselves because they're asking each other questions
A	it's weird I don't know if I like it yet
B	mm but if you're not asking a question what what are they supposed to say?
A	well I'm giving them answers to questions

B	mm?
A	I like the little fluffy bit on the side
A	it looks kind of like a beret
A	I wonder if she's looking at like the energy that you use you get around like your hands and stuff
B	mm
A	I wonder if she looks at that and can see it
B	maybe
A	or can see the colours of people's auras or anything like that
A	do you think?
B	well I used to watch the energy coming out of my fingers
A	mm like cos babies are so pure they wouldn't know any different
