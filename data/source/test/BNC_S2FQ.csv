A	we've just been spending time talking with
B	to do with social storytelling and how to teach someone how to problem solve
A	okay so one of the key things is about erm ensuring that we operate within a certain niche
B	mm mm
A	er however that might be formed and
B	yeah that will require a bit of market research
A	well you could certainly pick anything and you can go I am going to run through this process with the same
B	yeah but what?  what should we start with? I mean what's the sort of thing that's going to be the most compelling?
B	and how much of it has got a kind of teaching not teaching but an educational kind of slant to it?
A	what's the education element?
B	I don't know I don't know whether you bring in as an interviewer whether I'm you know bringing in some erm say external reading from different authors or I am just really keeping everything on track just being an interviewer and focusing right onto the person whose er
A	you see I've got this this thing about problem solving I don't I'm not convinced that's what it's about
B	mm
A	okay let's just for example say talk let's say car mechanics okay just for the sake of it and you've got erm Johnny who's just left school and he wants to be a car mechanic and he's got an interest and he's been doing some stuff himself and he has a problem
B	mm mm
A	and too often what happens is you know there's all this formal bullshit HR I need a good person I need to apply for a job a thousand ways using shitty CV interview approach with some a lot of people don't know how to interview and I am not given the opportunity to demonstrate myself or to show how valuable I can be to these people right and you will get people on all sorts of different levels but the reality is is that there is a comparative level and connection which goes together with personality and it goes together with skill base yeah
B	yeah but I don't want it to become just about finding a job for example
A	no no no I am not I am just all I've I am not talking about finding a job all I'm doing is using that as an example that that this person wants to go forward in some context in this case I said he wanted to jump forward in doing what he is passionate about
B	yeah
A	which is car mechanics
B	yeah no I get that so it is more like
A	he could he could go down
B	goal
A	the race track
B	let me speak it is all about
A	yeah you could say that you could say that mm mm
B	the only reason why I kind of I know what you mean but
A	mm
B	but solving isn't solving like a riddle or solving a situation whatever isn't a problem I think solving things finding ways to solve things is very useful for people
A	so it's it's crowd solving
B	yeah
A	now we find a a synonym for solving yeah
B	yeah crowd solving yeah
A	something like that yeah and
B	yeah that's really big and he looked like that
A	mm
A	mm
B	how to really collaborate
A	effectively to do something efficiently
B	mm
A	so what you are trying to demonstrate is er as an outcome of this thing is over a very short period of time you are demonstrating comparative er progress that it is significant progress
B	yeah
A	that's that's what you are showing people if
B	mm
A	yeah which we kind of indicated up on the board the other day about how you really need this other input
B	yeah
A	and that gets the community involved in you know and you would have seen examples of that on telly I think with with programming and stuff
B	yeah
A	where either the storyline is defined by some outside source or the likes of Big Brother where people vote on who survives and who doesn't
B	yeah
A	or whatever yeah but it is not as crass as that
B	no
A	it is not crass in any sense
B	no it is meant to be educational
A	it is supposed to be educational and and if people don't get the sense of
B	yeah
A	and and if we can demonstrate to people erm
B	mm
A	but you are actually demonstrating how effective they can be in a very short period of time
B	well this is going to fascinate me on what niche we're
A	it is a depression site yeah
B	yeah so you've got a couple of academics thrown in
A	so do you think they are going to pick up on threads like erm
B	yeah
A	and what I believe in is that it needs to be balanced
B	yeah
A	and so if if you can pin this together in such a way that there is a real community that's meeting
B	yeah
A	and like some other models that are working around the world at the moment you can set up satellite communities in different places around the world which are doing exactly the same model as you you are that the inputs can be international but the local community base is of the local ilk
B	mm
A	and that can have representatives who come from other places who join there and so they become part of a like community
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	erm
B	that's true it is just that it is about start-ups
B	and they all
B	entrepreneurial
A	thing yeah
B	so start-ups now what's a definition of a start-up?
A	erm there's actually a proper definition of it erm a lot of people think it's just kind of starting up a company but erm there is a formal definition of it let me just find out erm
A	I just said the most pizzery burp how burpy pizzery it was so I am just looking up the definition of start-up because
B	actually you know what
A	can it continue to grow?
B	he's kind of got a point because the more I'm thinking about it the more I like it because even the latest research from academics that would be put into a curriculum won't be nearly as up to date oh no no current as some of the things that we would discuss
A	yeah it is already behind the times
B	but it means
A	anything that's published is like that
B	yeah
A	because it takes time to be able to publish it
B	well yeah but nowadays we can have quite a lot of you know immediate publishing you know in terms of news
A	yeah but once it is published it is old news
B	yeah I'm talking about curriculum in universities
A	okay so carry on what is it that you like?
B	it's it's it's it's current
A	what is it that you like?
B	okay that erm
A	mm
B	and validated
A	yeah
B	and accredited
A	so it is quite
B	they are meant to have their lecturer do that for them by bringing in their own research and their research informs their teaching but it doesn't happen that way people say it happens like that but it doesn't
A	right okay  alright so what is it that you like? you like that
B	that if you are a student
A	yes
B	and you want to learn about start-ups you ain't get your needs satisfied at university unless you're incredibly lucky
A	yeah
B	so if you are young you are thinking about making a start-up
A	mm
B	you think maybe I should go to university and study this oh no crap I am not going to study this at university I am going to find another way and this is a complementary way of looking at things
A	yeah
B	in fact I can think of of already three people I could interview
A	yeah mm mm and the good thing with with with probably all of them is that they have a connection they had probably if you get them to distribute what they are talking about effectively and you somehow attach a product to it that by word of mouth you can get stuff out there fairly quickly
B	mm
A	and erm that's what intrigued me so much about this
B	mm
A	erm they simply came across a Youtube video of sixteen year olds who were teaching each other how to put on makeup and so they contacted a girl in the US who was teaching this to other students and making money out of it
B	mm mm
A	and they said we would like to use you to promote our products we have got custom design your own shoe and they ended up having to pay her money because she had a Hollywood agent and so on and so on they paid her some money she did it
B	wow
A	right
B	wow
A	on that site on that day and
B	mm
A	and so they had that problem and so they sent out another another way of doing it and after three weeks they actually got to their target market which were er business women yeah who would be paying two hundred bucks for a pair of shoes
B	yeah
A	so that just shows through using a different mechanism how and and there's nothing complicated about what they've done
B	they have yeah without much of a marketing budget by the sounds of things
A	well they've just used things
B	mm
A	to to create a viral story
B	mm
A	and the reason why it is is because there are enough
B	mm
A	they they have a different enough idea that it is disruptive to an existing industry
B	well I would say our idea is probably quite disruptive
A	so
B	mm
A	and what is it that's holding you up at the moment? what's your hurdle? yeah so you would go through that you would discover what the hurdle is
B	yeah you do but I think you know you've got to talk to the right people and suss out your ideas a bit more as well because like honestly it hadn't occurred to me until today and it obviously had to you but you hadn't discussed it with me
A	mm
B	that it was going to be on a certain kind of niche I hadn't got got that from what we put up on the board those problems are three very very different types of problems
A	mm
B	they are you know not really related to each other
A	mm mm
B	so from what we put on the board I was running with this very general kind of sense of things
A	and that's fine as long as you block all of those things under the guise of they're all students
B	yeah but I think you will get
A	well they are all problems that students could learn
B	the topic I think I understand though the question is one thing but the topic is another and it is true like what
A	mm
B	that's the topic
A	mm
B	the questions I ask
A	mm
B	are just questions I asked but the topic is entrepreneurs so I can't really say the topic is university students I would prefer to have something that's got a little bit more bite to it than that
A	the topic is education
B	yeah the topic is education
A	topic is learning topic is self-learning topic is self-directed learning topic is
A	yeah
B	which is what
A	part of the problem I have with it is
B	well what about if we put
A	we don't have we don't have we don't intrinsically have a track record that is enough to speak with authority
B	yeah but also
A	yeah but what you didn't know until today is is that before he got into that he had built a forty million dollar company when he was twenty-three
B	alright but what I am interested in is the topic that it is the mix of the people
A	oh they are
B	well then start-ups is great because it's around the demographic we're interested in
A	it is in the demographic where things do really kind of happen
B	yeah so we could you know interview the the people from the shoes
A	I I'm quite attracted to their thing erm I the reason why first they are in
B	mm
A	and that he is now quite connected with er investors various
B	mm mm
A	erm that they're still learning but they're a few steps ahead of where other people are going
B	mm
A	so they are not miles ahead they are not angel investors they are not
B	yeah but it's fudging it
A	well
B	that's a really weird way of doing things
A	do it backwards
B	no I mean the people in
A	yeah okay I can run with that erm I haven't looked around the net erm at start-up types there must be
B	yeah
A	I know
B	I was thinking how nice it would be to be tucked up in bed with a nice little cup of something hot
A	mulled wine
B	no
B	mm
A	but you get the point erm these communities er er are quite disparate there are several groups
B	mm
A	people go to different groups erm talking to a couple of people last week they kind of go along to these things and say that sometimes they are a bit hit-and-miss
B	yeah
A	so you will get an element of people who go there just to be listeners
B	yeah
A	and they say they are going to do something but they are not doers and then you have got the real people who are doers who go there to network to find people to partner with yeah
B	well that's alright that's a networking session I don't mind that it is not a learning session though
A	no but my point is if you join all that together as you're picking these people out of these groups within the groups the people know the people right so that's your niche that's your crowd
B	yeah yeah
A	and and then they can see well erm naturally these people get together and do this kind of networking solving problem stuff anyway
B	yeah
A	it is just that it is all kind of kept together nobody is learning from it it is just their little bubble
B	yeah that's true
A	and that's why they think it is all special because I'm all part of the team
B	yeah
A	and everybody else is out there you know
B	yeah
A	but
B	it's a bit silly
A	but we are moving into a society where everybody is expected to be more open and transparent
B	yeah
A	and with the way that information is spread anyway you can find out a hell of a lot without having a talk to these people in the first place
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	in modern society, privacy is expected	Contradiction
A	so
B	yeah
A	and the start-up and tech community in
B	it is interesting what
A	yeah well that's the way it is kind of working around the around the world erm and I bet that the people who are going forward here now have been watching what's been going on in the US for a long time yeah they simply
B	bugger
A	that's what I am seeing
B	well yeah I mean you know fair enough erm
A	it doesn't mean to say that you can't do anything it's just that
B	I like it I like it as a topic I think it's it's it's a good way to at least run with something to start with I think we needed to define what we were going to run with
A	mm
B	and I like it because I can see I could you know
A	the potential is you're going to get a lot more positive stories out of it because of the nature of it being a start-up
B	yeah
A	people will have an interest and try and make something go forward with progress
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a thinks speaker b will get negative stories	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	erm
A	I mean the nice idea for these people to become connected through
B	I think I am going to have to call it there tonight
A	okay that's there what's the time?
B	I don't have the time lady
A	the time old lady is quarter to nine
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b will continue a bit more tonight	Contradiction
