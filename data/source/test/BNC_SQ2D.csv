D	no
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	she is?
A	yeah
D	right
A	and she had Thursday off this week
D	alright
A	because
B	they'd be off to
A	they were going to go to um
D	mm
C	I really want to go to
D	mm
A	trouble is
D	yeah
A	and eh she's got every she said I've got all the symptoms that tell me
D	yeah
A	thirst
B	but she would've gone out so it must have been bad
A	yeah
B	mm
A	but she can  she can  really believe that she can't really be ill that's the problem with with lemon
D	mm
A	yeah but she like being ill too
D	mm well she she always thinks she's ill
A	mm
C	they untwisted it for her
B	mm
D	how did they do that?
C	I don't know
A	I expect they just put one of them drills in
C	she was in the
B	I know she's had everything done today
C	yes she's had everything done
B	awful
C	and they put her out
C	they knocked her out to do it
D	did they?
B	going both ways for
A	yeah
B	through her digestive track mm
C	mm
A	they did all her
D	my biscuit
A	you ate it
D	no there it is
A	she was then going to give you half of hers look
C	mm
A	what? No?
C	mm
D	yes so now she knows she can get all this fantastic treatment
A	yeah but apparently today's treatment was according to her thousands of JDs
C	mm hm
D	wait about three years
C	they haven't got the staff to be able to do it
B	mm
A	I just hope she doesn't have to pay for it
C	and just cos they say pay later
A	they said her employers are supposed to pay
C	she had everything
D	mm
C	and
A	and they put her under
B	yeah
B	yeah came round she didn't even know didn't even feel like they had been there
A	and she hadn't got a sore throat
C	it is amazing some of those healthcare options but it's the same here if you have like the private healthcare?
D	I don't know
C	but the NHS just can't afford to do that kind of thing test people for everything can they? Do you remember
A	no
C	to be able to so he went and paid for private healthcare and stayed there the whole day doing and they did every single test under the sun on him and then and then that's when he found out he had Crohn's disease and then from then onwards he could be treated by the NHS but it's all of the tests cos they cost a fortune
A	mm
D	really?
C	they can't do all of those tests for everybody
D	that's like my mum isn't it?
C	yeah
D	she's been trying to find out what was wrong with her for about eight years now
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	and they still don't know
C	yeah
D	that's because they're always playing golf
A	mm
C	no
A	no
D	yeah
C	yeah that's what the problem is
D	Cos every time she goes back to see our specialist he's either on holiday or something so she has to see someone else who doesn't know her history which is really complicated
A	yeah
D	so don't know
B	they should just be looking it up?
D	mm?
C	mm?
B	they should just be looking up her all history?
C	they
D	yeah I think
C	when they haven't seen her and you know in different situations they can't
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	you said they should be looking it up
C	it's not the same
A	but you went up to our doctors and they didn't even know you'd been to hospital with a broken wrist
B	yeah but that was a mistake wasn't it?
A	it was a big mistake
B	mm
A	they lost all mum's history up the hospital about her broken wrist that she went back to get the plaster on and they said oh you needn't have it then
B	we got the feeling that it was deliberately wiped off hadn't we?
A	mm
C	I went down here and and they said um we'd like you to see like a specialist plastic surgeon for your head and I said no thank you I don't wanna see plastic and cos they were they kept going on about cosmetic surgery
A	mm
C	and I was going no I don't want that I just wanted to talk to someone about something else and they kept going on about it and then three years later when they got my doctor's notes they said oh I
D	yeah
C	and said you saw a specialist when you were eighteen? I said no I didn't and they showed me all of the notes and a signature to say I'd been to hospital when I was eighteen and I never went
B	ooh
C	and I think the doctors might have covered their backs or something
D	yeah
C	I don't know  I don't know  what it was
D	they're useless
C	I I couldn't have completely forgotten unless they knocked me out
B	you were eighteen
C	huh?
B	you were eighteen you were then off to?
C	yeah before I went maybe it was before
A	yeah
B	to
C	I can't remember the exact age they said that I went
A	nineteen she went to
B	eighteen
C	but it was around when I was eighteen
A	no no well
C	unless they completely just knocked me out and dropped me off again
B	we took you up the hospital
C	oh yeah but that was when I was little
B	yeah I know
C	that's um
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C had also a problem in the eye when he/she was 18.	Neutral
B	because we were so worried because it used to swell up so badly and we used to think if she falls
A	her head would go shhhh
B	it'll it'll
D	like a water bomb
B	explode
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C was not young when everything happened.	Contradiction
B	it was awful
C	exploding head
A	no implode
C	implode? Urgh
B	then when I took you up it was this flat as anything wasn't it?
C	yeah
B	so um we thought we we wanna show them you know how it is normally
A	they hung you upside down did they?
B	so he held
B	they had me upside down
D	did they hold your ankles?
C	yeah mum had me up against the wall upside down until it was time to go in the doctor's
[ANNOTATION]	Some speakers were held upside down.	Entailment
D	yeah
B	up
C	yeah but it wasn't not when it was bad
B	they had records on it anyway
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C was in a particular position for a long time before visiting the doctor.	Neutral
A	is it still the shape of a horse? His head?
C	well
A	that she was born
D	what her birthmark on her head?
A	she was born her birthmark
[ANNOTATION]	The birthmark looked like a thunder.	Neutral
A	she was born in the year of the horse and she had and that was a horse's head on
D	yeah
A	her birthmark was a horse's head
C	yeah
C	it's much better lately actually
D	yeah it is
C	it's alright at the moment
D	mm
C	goes through its phases of being bad
A	I think it's eh it's also due to stress and stuff
C	yeah
B	there was one time it was quite  underneath there wasn't it?
C	oh yeah it is it does still change shape underneath
B	mm
C	yeah
B	have you? What to keep
C	I usually wear my scarf

D	what what would you say if you were facing east?
A	southern wind
C	so I was facing the wind? So I was standing upwind
D	sidewind?
C	downwind
A	no
C	no it's still downwind it's still downwind cos that wind would be the wrong direction
D	mm
A	well you if you're stalking a deer you'd

A	downwind
A	because the wind come pass the deer
C	mm
A	anyhow you were downwind of the sawdust

A	what grater did you use?
C	I used the cheese grater
A	did you?
C	I grated each individual potato what a waste of time that was
A	not the little fine one? Not the little fine one?
C	no no no no no
A	no
C	the fat one you're supposed to have big fat grated ones
C	no I was supposed to not quite cook them as much
A	that's right
C	and I thought they
A	yes
B	yeah
A	off of him
D	are these the ones you bought from that farm?
A	yeah
B	they're usually excellent
A	they're usually excellent but this year they've got some kind of black spot or something or other I don't know what it is but they got like it was probably that frost we had
D	frost
A	and they got really frosted
C	mm
D	mm
C	well they're still nice anyway
D	mm
C	anyway that's why they don't have butter in them
A	they don't make good chips either
C	they did
A	well I didn't think they were as good as is normal
C	mm
D	did you watch that football earlier?
A	yeah what eh?

A	West Ham two Cardiff nil
D	mm
A	yeah

A	nah no it was pretty useless really I'm glad I didn't see the first half
D	mm hm
A	and Cardiff were rubbish
D	mm hm
A	but the excuse was they did play a lot of football last week
B	what?
A	they're supposed to be professional players
C	that's their excuse for not playing well?
D	well they don't get paid enough do they?
A	no they don't get paid enough
D	to play two weeks in a row I mean
A	no
D	pushing it isn't it?
B	yeah
A	and that eh Chelsea boss
D	avram Grant
A	yeah him
D	no not Avram Grant
A	no not Avram Grant
D	yeah Barras wannit yeah A V B or whatever they call him
A	yeah that's him
D	yeah
A	he'll want something like two hundred and fifty thousand pound a week
D	yeah
A	will want at least a hundred and sixty thousand pound each
D	yeah but they're all a bunch of money grabbing whatsits aren't they?
A	yeah
D	there's very few players now that play for the love of the game at all
A	no
D	or have any kind of um tie to their club
A	it's an awful lot of money to to expect  to expect  innit?
D	yeah
A	just because
D	yeah
C	I'm gonna go and do some work
D	yeah I better go and do some as well
A	it's hard work doing work innit?
D	it is hard work doing work
C	just before dinner really I'm gonna do a bit of work
D	half past four
C	before dinner and then
D	well I've got
C	yeah
A	well we've done our hour and a half haven't we
C	yep and you've nearly fix the microwave so that's saved you quite a lot of money
A	what a again
C	again you did spend about eight hours on yesterday but
C	it worked for the night
A	off you see
C	yeah
A	I can't
C	really?
A	yeah
C	why? It's just that
A	because it won't be able to
C	but all it is is the door it's so frustrating
A	it is frustrating
C	because mm
B	it's a brilliant microwave
A	it's a brilliant microwave and a stupid poxy Panasonic plastic bit
B	it does everything really
A	they make a microwave for two hundred quid and they stick a stupid little plastic bit in it that wears out and breaks within a year
C	oh so that you buy another one but actually go well the microwaves are actually very good so let's get the same one
A	I wonder if they've updated cos on the net they they reckon that this is the problem with Panasonic using cheapskate designers
D	yeah
A	they're good designers with all the rest of them but
C	you like Panasonic?
A	yeah
C	you've got Panasonic
A	they're good designers with the electronics
C	yeah
A	but when it comes to the actual working piece with the mechanical piece
C	yeah
A	they reckon their designers are using useless
C	so you
A	we changed over to Panasonic because Sony got too expensive
C	and your
A	we were Sony people
B	part and part
C	I don't know what I would choose
D	I'd choose what the cheapest
C	yeah and then they'd just break
D	not necessarily
A	Samsung was good now yeah
C	I like Samsung
D	although they've started shipping their manufacturing over to China
A	yeah
D	so they've gone cheap as well
C	yes so they're all the same now
D	well everyone gets manufactured in China now
A	and
D	there's not much difference really
C	well I think Samsung them aren't they gonna get the North Koreans to make some
A	when we were when we were working on the asphalt we had to go and asphalt Sony's factory down at
D	mm
C	mm
A	Cos transistor radios were the big thing then weren't they? And they had these chips about that big
D	mm
A	and they would churn them out
C	mm
A	yeah and then when eh when eh everybody got to know how to make them they made them cheaper and sold them cheaper and Sony closed the factory down
C	mm
A	yeah
D	right
C	yep me too
A	me too
