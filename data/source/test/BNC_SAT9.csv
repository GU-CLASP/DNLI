B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't know
A	oh nice
B	I think she was chatting me up
A	do you reckon?
B	yeah
A	maybe a bit of both
B	I was just
A	no I know but I was just think of er why she'd come over
B	well I like to think it was because I looked
A	I'm sure it was
B	I just look incredibly fit
A	yeah
B	such an unusual view
A	yeah
B	erm right
A	oh
B	oh
A	well yeah
B	erm do you want to do see if anyone wants to do with anything?
A	in some ways I wouldn't mind just sort of being in
B	well we haven't seen anyone for
A	true
B	relatively kinky
A	yeah
B	there are dotted about
A	I can text
B	there are a lot of XC90s in here
A	mm
B	they've
A	which one sorry the?
B	xC90
A	right
B	erm
A	wow
B	it is very old
A	mhm
B	these wheels are severely out of alignment
A	even in your Polo
B	no I was thinking more sort of friends rather than
A	yeah okay
B	or
A	or
B	or
A	true
B	yeah but it's a most it is an MPhil which is a kind of Masters
A	true
B	it's not taught is it?
A	yeah
B	oh
A	A lot of the MPhils are taught for art
B	what?
A	this is the constant angle
B	can I have my er?
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	what would you like to do?
B	well not to er be a pain
A	yeah
B	erm
A	mhm
B	but I dunno
A	yeah well I I was thinking to plan for the next little while erm if we go back erm
B	erm entirely up to you
A	yeah I could  I could  get the ironing out of the way I suppose erm
B	I would really just like to sit down and have some ice
A	no definitely I
B	no I don't think
A	but yeah
B	well it was more sort of a wandering around the shops it wasn't hugely healthy
A	yeah
A	hmm
B	erm we could hit the gym and do some weights
A	tonight?
B	I'm tempted to leave that for tonight cos it is still sort of active and walking round
A	erm yeah
B	not too much yeah
A	not too much
B	yeah
A	so
B	yeah
A	it wasn't uninteresting it just wasn't
B	I know it was sort of
A	hmm
B	it was very subtle
A	it was
B	yes
A	erm
B	but you just sort of hit sit back and it hits you
A	yeah
B	mm
A	Cos it was chicken and rice basically
B	I I have also concluded come to the conclusion that I'm against having sort of the two cooked dishes I had in
A	ah right you had a sort of a selection er selection yeah
B	yeah it was sort of eh overwhelmingly rich
A	right okay
B	yes
A	oh
B	yeah
A	Cos you know it's not like it's this price for two it's just this price for all of it and
B	this is true
A	with our voucher
B	oh
A	ah that is only on Sunday and Thursday though unfortunately but I might be able to wangle another twenty-five pounds off
B	indeed
A	but erm
B	oh er
A	yeah
B	what the fuck are you doing out by yourself?
A	possibly out with this person
B	yeah possibly
A	that goal was in
B	you're getting drawn into an
A	put your foot
B	ow
A	okay?
B	oh can you work the clutch for me?
A	I'm not sure I can chuck
B	yeah just lean over
A	and poke it occasionally
B	the clutch or my leg?
A	the clutch I was thinking but your leg if that would help
B	at the moment I'm finding the idea of an automatic unbelievably attractive
A	oh there's that couple from Cambourne who get
B	where?
A	erm on the
B	okay
A	mm
B	my god
A	all from customer services
B	mm
A	did you see  Did you see
B	the other week
A	oh the other week right
B	that would be a good place to live
A	mm yeah
B	yeah I would be very happy if I lived there
A	yeah it's lovely
B	yeah look like it
A	okay so yeah so I'll do the shopping and the ironing in which ever order
B	oh
A	oh no it's not
B	park somewhere else
A	I'm just going to block the road
B	or at least if you're going to
A	yeah exactly no he was er
B	well but she obviously had had to get out
A	yeah exactly
B	erm?
A	I'm happy to do either like I said erm
B	er in some ways it might be nice to see people erm I'd be more inclined to say sort of ask Billy first
A	okay
B	well I well if you ask him today
A	yeah okay
B	presumably
A	well do you want to do that then?
B	maybe yeah I think just it might be nice to see him
A	maybe? Ah
B	and possibly
A	yeah
B	what's he been doing recently anyway?
B	mm
A	I don't think er anything massively surprising
B	I'm going to find these next few weeks quite difficult
A	I know you are chuck
B	yes
A	yeah I think the key is to make sure that you don't just end up getting bored
B	doing nothing
A	Cos I think
B	I will try swimming
A	oh do you think that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	oh I need to do that this weekend anyway when I  when I  get home
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	Cos he might give you some interesting ideas for things to you know just for some variety
B	there's not much cardio you can do on upper body
A	mm
B	I mean there's the hand bike thing
A	that's true yeah
B	well that's cos our gym's got too many good things
A	mm
B	mm
B	yeah I know
A	the nurse did seem quite sympathetic to that she's sort of erm
B	doctor? Nurse?
A	the sorry the doctor in erm well the one who's told you
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh and maybe erm go to the cinema next week
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yes
A	I can er start investigating
B	I assume they'd tell us because it would be his chance for him to get more money out of this one wouldn't it?
A	well yeah exactly
B	mm
A	non
B	well cos er
A	if you didn't change?
B	so for example my parents before they signed up to fibre they had normal broadband and it was a damn sight better than ours currently is
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I don't really know how it  how it  works
B	phenomenal fibre speeds are about a hundred times better than what we're currently on as we're on about point four and they're up to forty
A	yes
B	what?
A	Joy
B	four would be an improvement
A	yeah four would be lovely
B	what?
A	well as in it's it's a definite project that's going to go ahead
B	and where to get the information from
A	exactly
B	see I have yet to find this website
A	well we went on it
B	I've well I think I found it once and have been unable to find it since probably
A	well what was it? Oh since yeah
A	ah
B	ah
A	it's alright chuck
B	no it's not
A	I know but get it go back
B	I know
A	oh yes
B	mm
A	I love Amazon Prime
B	yes how long does it last for?
A	thirty days I think it was so I've still got a couple of weeks I think
B	I thought you already had done
A	I had but I'll just the check the page again
B	well not that much of a con
A	not that much of a con yeah
B	no
A	you can if you want to
B	no it's not worth it
A	okay
B	well they seem to have gone away from that
A	yeah
B	I didn't know that you were selling it
A	hmm? Nice
B	yes
A	yeah
B	it could have been a lot worse
A	it could have been an awful lot worse
B	no erm
A	yeah
B	erm in the sense of I think she behave she's a very different people around for different people
A	yeah she is
B	and to some extent it might be nicer if
A	yeah
B	but it's just interesting that I mean I think a lot of
A	yeah
B	I don't understand how you could drink like a fish in certain situations and then have absolutely nothing in the other
A	yeah
B	I it's weird
A	I agree
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b understands perfectly how they could drink so much	Contradiction
B	like last night I was really expecting her to have some wine with dinner
A	yeah a glass of wine like it's not exactly
B	yes exactly
B	mm
A	and she's very easily erm kind of erm angered by people doing stuff and
B	on like what?
A	well just like sort of cyclists doing something or pedestrians doing something or erm that kind of thing
B	really? When was that?
A	did you? Yeah like when we cycled into town she was really quite kind of erm on edge about and so you know there's lots of pedestrians just stepped out
A	hmm
B	as well but er anyway sorry carry on
A	and just and like just occasionally this week she sort of I don't know if I've just been moving too slowly or something but she's stormed off
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b was hoping to drink wine with supper	Entailment
B	fingers?
A	erm she picks the skin on her fingers and it's right back to basically to her knuckles
B	what?
A	it's absolutely disgusting
B	how did you notice that?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has their nails painted	Neutral
A	mm
B	erm could you do me a favour?
A	yeah
B	there's a big rock in the middle of the drive
A	yeah I see it
B	whenever we're there you can't get at it
A	yeah sure I'll I'll go and move it
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b needs a rock moved from the driveway	Entailment
