A	big old softy
B	Cos he had me over
A	really?
B	recently we were in a car park and he's got an extendable lead which I hate because I don't like the fact that if he takes off and I haven't got it clipped in he's motoring by the time he gets to the end of it
A	oh no
B	I had to let I mean the lead just went out of my hand and I was flat on my face on the front of the car
A	oh gosh really?

B	and
A	ah
B	yeah
A	is he looking for things to invest in?
B	yeah
A	because I've got a friend who's looking for an investor
B	okay
A	and everything she does is without erm preservatives so it has a very short shelf like compared to something you'd pick up in Tesco's
B	really?
A	and laid on the the welcome and they wanted to buy her range off her and erm sell it in Tesco's
B	that's somewhat of
A	exactly
B	well
A	oh wow
B	and he he put this
A	brilliant
B	so I'm surprised it's somebody at the college that's pushing her into looking at that
A	really? Well I'll get her to look into that

A	ah

A	I have had I
B	that's interesting cos I wouldn't say that
A	yeah
B	but I do enjoy the teaching
A	but that's  But that's  what I come from

B	as a student
A	oh okay
B	and they and I've also been in cake decorating not not really
A	yeah
B	whether it's appropriate to their skills or whatever
A	right

A	hiya
A	hi how are you?
unknown_female	sorry I was playing with the dog
B	yeah he'll be pleased with that cos I kicked him out cos he was being a bit of a pain
A	getting a wet muzzle and

B	yeah
A	oh right okey-doke
A	well it's just there at maybe at the right angle for him?
B	right right yeah
A	well as long as you enjoy the teaching stuff that you're doing
B	yeah I do I must admit
A	yes
B	but erm
A	cool
B	it's very different to teaching kids
A	and your mum says that you're teaching
unknown_female	what?
B	no
unknown_female	no no no
B	oh
unknown_female	I did  I did  erm doing a bit of coaching in eh
A	well kind of like teaching isn't it?
unknown_female	yeah
A	sports teaching
B	actually you you you're good at it with the hockey aren't you? Well he did it  he did it  for a year a school didn't you? When you left school
unknown_female	yeah I I quite enjoy it
B	you are being a pain
unknown_female	do you want me to put him out?
B	well he's been out and he was whining at us
B	no
A	yeah well so I'm at the moment looking for jobs in like the publishing world
B	oh okay
A	yeah I've I've just
B	no
A	erm and it was more of a sales and marketing type roles trying to promote their primary course books and materials to to schools
B	oh okay
A	but I didn't get an interview because I imagine that they've got sales and marketing professionals who went for that job
B	right
A	that is eh managing their online placement tests
B	is that based in
A	no in Oxford
B	that'll be nice
A	yeah
B	that's different isn't it?
A	yes
B	and you've got a lot of TEFL experience haven't you?
A	yeah well most of the requirements I actually have
B	makes a lot of sense
A	be good
B	I don't know
A	the angle it must be
B	I can see that
A	you're more malleable
B	and I think you're also a bit na√Øve
A	yeah
B	so you sort of
A	yeah
B	really? That's a lot
A	and eh three of us are not straight out of uni
B	mature students as it were
A	and the other guy is French
B	that's ridiculous
A	I mean
B	that's ridiculous
A	it just is ridiculous
B	you're reinventing the wheel all the time aren't you?
A	exactly
B	it's completely pointless
A	exactly exactly
B	yeah
A	right
B	even if they could read it the content was totally inappropriate
A	well what
B	all the time
A	the kids get so used to them
B	yes they do
A	and the teachers like oh using smart boards as if this is so you know cutting edge and we'll motivate the kids
B	but OFSTED has pushed that though
B	and my when I had my lesson review afterwards this woman said it's just
A	what do you want me to do? Buy a computer?
B	what do you want me to do? Yeah I you know
A	well that's a stupid thing to say
B	well it's just
A	it's like saying I would like to have seen that class taught in Africa
B	yeah it's exactly what it
A	yeah yeah I agree
B	we bought some erm
A	well the whole thing of you can arrange things on on the document
B	mm hm
A	so that the kids can actually come up to the back eh to the Smartboard and with their finger like move it around as if it were a touchscreen
B	yeah
A	for some things
B	yeah
A	and then format that
B	and match them up
A	and the kids one at a time had to come up
B	and that's
A	which is another problem
B	that is a problem
A	like everyone else switches off
B	yeah absolutely
A	and you know I I was giving them lots of little conversation cards and
B	that they've actually got here and they can
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but they don't know how to behave
B	no they don't
A	in a
B	I had to teach Spanish to we
A	that is a modern foreign language isn't it? Don't have to specify which one
B	and they did quite enjoy it in a funny sort of way
A	oh fantastic
B	which was a very traditional way of teaching
A	works
B	actually I had them onside because the were occupied and they were  they were  part of it
A	how old were they?
B	these guys were year seven
A	right
B	so first year seniors
A	well I I prepared an activity to learn the colours in Spanish whereby erm they had a presentation of Noah's ark but all the different animals were different colours
B	oh magic
A	I'd made it look silly different colours
B	yeah
A	but she said no no no no you can't get your children colouring in a French lesson
B	but that's not
B	she's completely missed the point of education which is actually you utilise
A	but what I thought she missed the point of was that the colouring was not the end
B	no
A	product
B	to get them to there
A	which you know would have worked
B	that's right
A	they do get into
B	yes
A	silly animals
B	yeah absolutely
A	but no I was told not to  not to  bring
B	that's just silly isn't it? And when you get out there you do your own thing anyway
A	yeah true
B	unfortunately that's the difference
A	right
B	that they weren't necessarily teaching us what was appropriate
A	erm
B	yeah
A	like there exists for English language teaching and I'm sure that must exist it it must exist in
B	yeah it does or most most secondary schools use
A	but then
B	use textbooks
A	yeah but they're the most driest of the dry textbooks
B	but they and they have they will have a well certainly most
A	from what
B	pretty much yeah
A	right
B	as a  As a  erm department
A	well I wouldn't mind doing mostly someone else's thing
B	that's right
A	because I think one of the reasons that they had stopped using course books was that they are so dry and they are so boring
B	yeah
A	practice listening to it
A	write you know change their handwriting every other page and flick ink of the page
B	this is secondary kids?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	but you know if even if they came to well that's if they came to the lesson with a pen because it wasn't cool to have a pencil case
B	it's crazy
A	but they've just been you know they're spoon fed because all the teachers now just give them pens cos they know
B	Cos it means they can get on
A	it that they can get on with it
B	really?
A	the violence
B	where was this? Was it
A	in
B	I went into
A	really?
B	I I stood outside the front door said well I better ask cos it maybe
A	mm hm
B	so I stood outside the door and there's a women in an abaya in the let me help you desk in the corner who just sat there looking at me
A	La la la la la
B	and they knew they all knew I was there
A	the headmaster
B	the headmaster as he was going to his office
A	well at least the led
B	at least he
A	by example
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	and there's signs saying walk on the right walk on the left do this do that
A	well I went to a training session
B	I just thought let me out of here
A	entitled how we can reclaim the corridors
A	oh he was at
B	yeah he did that
A	well this is my  this is my
B	and he handed his notice in the following day
A	yeah this is my take on it
B	it was just
A	it's an unrealistic situation
B	yeah
A	right
B	so
A	yeah
B	and the girls saw school as a way out of home
A	gosh
B	we're talking thirty years ago
A	right
B	so we're now second and third generation
A	yeah
B	it's a bit like
A	yeah and they've been taught that benefits is a career move and having a kid will get you a council house
B	gets you a flat
A	it's a tough situation
B	we had a sixteen year old girl
A	you can kind of understand it can't you? You can  You can  see the root of it the root cause of it but
B	he's being an absolute pain
A	ah it's cos he wants my leg
B	he doesn't do it normally
A	yeah the last few times I've been here he's always been really chilled and
B	we've walked him he's had about a five mile walk this morning
A	ooh
B	and then he needs another walk this evening
A	you have to walk him for five miles
B	we tend to walk him for about an hour and a half
A	that's nice though cos it gets you out
B	it does well we've given up our gym memberships
A	yeah
B	well I was getting all sorts of repetitive strain injuries in my shoulders and things from swimming
A	ah ha
B	Cos I walk eight miles
A	I don't notice a difference
B	yeah yeah I'm alright
B	in my ski socks and walking trousers
A	yeah you always have a way of looking glamorous with your earrings and your
B	no
A	oh you normally have your nails painted
B	no they're all shortened
A	so yeah
B	no I can understand that
A	mm
B	yeah you do
A	push you a long in that career
B	I know that
A	is this
A	I had an
B	and then they had an ambulance man in to because somebody got hit and so badly hurt they had to take them off
A	yeah I had a policeman come into my class to remove a girl that
B	that was
A	it is  It is  and as you say it comes from home
B	it does come from home
A	lack of
B	it means that it's not appropriate what you're teaching is not appropriate to those kids
A	these guys for example they're all fantastic about shouting their mouth off
B	listen to save their lives
A	how can you learn a foreign language without having listening skills
B	and actually reality
A	oh oh
B	and this woman was in the car park absolute guns blazing
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and I went over and I said you know I think you've you need  you need  to hear her side of the story
A	yeah yeah and you have to shout to be heard
B	no it is it's really
A	no
B	you've had them
A	totally
B	and they don't see it as their responsibility to actually perhaps read with the children or do things with the children
A	were these the children maybe that had so the parents could get the council house or single parent benefit
B	probably
A	it is such a shame
B	it is a shame
A	but it's everything I mean it's not just erm
B	no
A	so they have no
B	no
A	they never have to do that
B	it's what suits me
A	it's all prescribed
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	so yeah school uniform
A	yeah
B	no it's it's a really a difficult one
A	yeah
B	you get different problems
A	exactly
B	you get different issues
A	exactly
B	you get pushy parents
A	I guess working with adults in a business environment you get problems there too don't you?
B	you get politics don't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah it's interesting
A	but I think at the moment I'd like to spend this year at least trying to find
B	try something different
A	well it's not really worth it because
B	if you don't do the teaching then
A	no
B	the job market out there is shocking
A	yeah
B	despite despite the unionisation? Cos I know my brother in law says they're having a real problem with they're actually now shutting office out there but it's taken them years
A	really?
B	to get to the point where they could actually shit it because the employment laws were so favourable to the staff
A	really?
B	that
A	well this is what the government changed about six months ago
B	eh yes
A	indemnification
B	right
A	so they'd made it a lot easier for people to sack their employees recently
B	that must have been why they wanted to shut the office them
A	which
B	he said it was just prohibitively expensive to do so before
A	yeah yeah it would have been
B	was cheaper to actually keep them working?
A	yeah
B	at at a loss
A	mm hm
A	yeah
B	right
A	the any information please contact this person
B	it's all there
A	okay you look at a job that was going on the OUP Espanya website and it was three lines prod ELT product specialist required
B	right
A	that you don't you know you never find out about
B	right
A	yeah exactly
B	or whatever
A	yeah it's like a market over there in a different way
[ANNOTATION]	The person that is responsible for information provision is a woman.	Neutral
B	it's going down the tubes big time isn't it?
A	mm
B	is it going to be the next Greece?
A	who knows
B	bit worrying isn't it?
A	yes
B	you're probably better off over here in in many respects I suppose from that point of view
A	well I think so in looking for jobs wise
B	so how did you get the
A	oh just eh looking online
[ANNOTATION]	Greece have a low living cost.	Neutral
B	right
A	and so just luck really that I'd seen it and
A	it's been perfect
B	yeah get you back on your feet again
A	yeah
B	is there?
A	so yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B is in a great economical situation.	Contradiction
B	yeah but it's an experience isn't it? Which is quite useful for what you
A	yeah definitely
B	job applications
A	yeah
B	you can cope with that can't you? I mean that's that's fair enough
A	yeah
B	you're an adult and
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B finds experiences pretty useful.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	yeah you should be able to be trusted but
A	but I do find that they they do
B	I think though a lot of teacher I think particularly people who come out of university erm
A	do you know what I could see that in the staff room
B	oh
A	the cattiness
[ANNOTATION]	The staff room is enormous.	Neutral
B	yeah they never grow up  they never grow up  It's a nightmare
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	you know
A	well I don't know what I'm I'm used to working with teens and teachers who don't actually have to work together but do because they realise that team work is actually very beneficial for everybody
B	no they're
A	I couldn't believe that I you know I expected
B	oh that's good
A	so supportive so human
B	oh yeah
A	completely unprofessional comments being slung across the staffroom I was like
B	that's that is  that is  standard
A	are talking to each other in this way?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I had that particularly over here
A	but that's the thing I never had that in the TEFL teaching
B	they have this thing that
A	petty
B	oh it's ridiculous
A	stupid
B	well
A	she'll probably fit right in
B	she will
A	but do you find in general that in business people are more professional
B	oh
A	right
B	we
B	really really
A	it's worse than the students
B	on Facebook
A	crikey
B	yeah well se
A	did this other the replacement teacher find out about it? Was she?
B	oh she knew all about it
A	really?
B	yeah
A	oh dear
B	its staggering absolutely staggering
A	yeah definitely
B	no I always used to carry on and work through
A	mm hm
B	but that still left me with four weeks actually and at you know Christmas time
A	yeah yeah
B	so
A	mm
B	but the kids are gone by three o'clock in the afternoon four o'clock in the afternoon
A	do you think it's just a problem for this area of
B	I should think it's countrywide in the cities
A	yeah
B	erm it's definitely easier working
A	have you worked in non-city place?
B	erm
A	yeah
B	and the problem is that places like
A	mm
B	so you've got a no win situation really
A	but I saw that that type of behaviour I think jaded the staff to such an extent that even the good teacher's just ended up not being good because for example the guy that I was  I was  attached to his form group
A	that's not going to
B	you're going to change you've lost it
A	exactly exactly
B	it
A	well that's another thing
A	straight to the leg right
B	come here  Come here
A	see what happens when I uncross my legs
B	yeah I know we do love you we just don't want you being a pain alright? Okay?
A	who's a beautiful doggy?
B	cor dear
A	aw
B	ah it's a shame
A	mm
B	yeah
A	I can't deal with that amount of
B	it's no
A	yeah
B	but you can't always take that into account
A	he's got is paw on my leg
B	tembo
A	he's trying to make my leg go
B	aw
A	stop with your wet snout all over me
B	so yeah it's difficult
A	you're such a beautiful boy
B	so have you got the cats with you?
A	no they're in
B	ah
A	so I have been covered in pussy cats
B	are you going to go out here? Come on away you go
A	yeah in many ways I feel like I just went over to Spain for a gap year and I've come back and I'm trying to do the adult life
A	doing driving lessons looking for work
B	fourteen years
A	yeah
B	amazing
A	I don't think of the the number
B	I thought you must be
A	yeah but
B	I was thirty  I was thirty  seven actually when I did my PGCE
A	oh really

B	no he's a good lad
A	how did it turn out?
B	he's a great cook
A	fantastic
B	not a problem
A	aw
B	but no he likes cooking actually
A	he's not so good at shopping
B	therein lies the problem
A	oh shall I let him back in?
B	oh you are just being nuisance
A	what's wrong?
B	I want to be with you
A	aw look at him
B	so you'll have that on tape
A	sorry?
B	that'll be on the tape
A	yeah that'll appear in the British spoken corpus of canine whinging
B	yeah if you're alright with him it's just he was a nuisance on top of you all the time
A	I'm fine with him
B	that's a good boy
A	Good boy
B	normally he comes in and he sits in there and just goes to sleep
