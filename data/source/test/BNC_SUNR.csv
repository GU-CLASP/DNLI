C	oh maybe she's a thief
A	yeah so I really wanted it bad
C	ah
A	and I think it's it's the it's got to be done
C	you've got to get rid of
A	yeah so I'm gonna ring
C	no
A	so
C	nice
A	yeah
C	so what's so what was the issue with the tax then? The tax from work?
A	I'm on the wrong fucking tax code
C	ugh
A	yeah
C	how do you know these things? How does one know whether you're on the wrong one?
A	um cos my if it ends in an M it's mm week month one week one or some at like that
C	yeah?
A	the tax office believe that that's what I'll be paid every month for the rest of the year
C	yeah
A	no
C	mm
A	so that's bullshit
C	that is a bit shit
A	mm
C	it must be said
A	like at Christmas I got my I got like three hundred pound bonus or something
C	mm
A	lost seventy quid of it
C	huh?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	quite the rebate
A	and cos we keep hitting our budget I should be potentially getting a hundred pound extra
C	mm
A	which is better than a poke with a sharp stick
C	in your eyeball
A	in my eye in my eyeball
C	as opposed to up your bum hole
A	yes
C	in your peen eye
A	yes in the penis
C	oh does it feel nice?
A	yeah
C	right
A	no it just reminds me that it's there
C	ah
A	which isn't fun
C	that's not a lot of fun
A	I really want yeah I really want my phone back
C	that's what happens when you invite boys to your house that you don't know
A	I know
C	and you leave it in your bed
A	no
C	before you left the house?
A	no
C	I like this one the best
A	oh I like that one
C	the rest of it is a bit take it or leave it but I just wanted a long necklace
A	I think it's really pretty
C	and it was just fifty P
A	what?
C	yeah
A	ah
C	I got this one for fifty P and the other one for ninety-five P
A	I love charity shopping
C	get
C	oh
A	yeah
C	is it of Mickey Mouse
A	probably
C	maybe I should just go to the Co-Op
A	huh?
C	maybe I should just go to the Co-Op
A	well we can just go to Co-Op
C	yeah
A	that is an option
C	as an option
C	but with the pasta
A	mm
C	I could make  I could make carbonara though if you get I've got cream in the fridge but I need it for the thing that we'll make tomorrow
C	cake
A	cake
C	we probably should have made cake for your tea but then we would have eaten said cake
A	and had nothing for the mother
C	and that's why I was a bit scared about putting the fizz in the fridge
A	prosecco
C	yeah it was like that Prosecco but it's called  as opposed to
A	oh
C	so it's sort of it's ten pounds a bottle and it's very rarely on offer
A	ah
C	it's nicer than just getting Cava
A	ha
C	I looked in the shower earlier I still had red marks on my arms
A	ah
C	from my freaking basket
A	pained
C	everyone had the death wish today as well
A	ah
C	and it just fucks you off cos you think just look
C	who reverses and doesn't look?
A	do you know
C	people that don't want to live
A	yeah or people that are on the roundabout cut me up like they're going to go into my car and I'm thinking how can you not
C	well I think they just  they just  don't know
C	in terms of the rules of the road though?
A	yeah
C	like you're you always know where you're supposed to be
A	no
C	people just go for it
A	people just taking the piss
C	there are far too many  far too many  cars for the roads
A	er the first year I lived here I wanted to move away
C	yeah fine
A	when our
C	mm
A	why? Cos it doesn't function as a city
C	yeah
A	and it doesn't work
C	it doesn't work
A	yeah but I think once you're here you get sucked in
C	that's what happens  what happens
A	well
A	I dunno he can email it to my email
C	yeah or my phone
A	yeah
C	mm
A	I bet it's gonna be awful
C	it's gonna be chavtastic
A	yes
C	it would be pretty bad
C	aw bless
A	I'd just do it
C	I think I might
A	I'm that's a really big bear bug for me of mine and think is one as well

C	all of those
C	and it sounded about five sevens
A	ha yeah
C	and then wondered why she couldn't text me because this number doesn't exist
A	mm mm
C	and obviously on this it comes up as a little conversation
A	oh yeah saved it
C	she replies I don't get it
A	the crazy one?
C	the crazy number
A	oh my friend
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	so when so she presses reply it doesn't work because it goes to the crazy number
A	what?
C	she's like I'm kind of nestled but she'd done all her hair and she was ready to go
A	ah
C	I know
A	ah
C	can you remember the days when no one had mobiles and you had to meet at Woolworths at exactly eleven o'clock
A	yeah
C	you had to be there
A	and the panic was if you weren't then you had to try and find a pay phone and you've got a number written down half your arm
C	where could they be? Awful
A	ah
C	those were the days
A	have you got twenty? You'd pick up twenty Ps
C	horrendous wasn't it
A	I remember you used to have to get off the train
C	oh no way
A	and wait for them to come
C	oh
A	well it's only like a five minute drive but still
C	yeah that's true yeah
A	mad
C	what a bitch
A	yeah
C	oh wow girls
A	aagh
C	I I don't know how people lived
A	uh-uh
C	I um made the mistake of when I first moved to uni um I didn't tell people that I lived that the name of the village that I lived in
A	yeah
C	so it's completely redundant
A	right
C	fine lovely
A	yep
C	erm
A	no
C	so she'd gone straight on the train
C	and I was waiting at the train station for about an hour and a half
A	after the flight
A	can you imagine?
C	so she got to sample you know the British rail and which I'm sure is a delight at rush hour
A	yeah
C	with a massive backpack
A	yes
C	smelling
A	yeah after a massive flight
C	having been you know when you sleep on people's floors for a week
A	yeah
C	so she well didn't really speak to me for most of that night
A	yeah
C	yeah it's quite bad yeah
A	that's pretty serious
C	what a twat
C	who doesn't tell someone who's coming to stay where they actually live? Here's your first challenge
A	it's like when you stay with friends
A	it's like that
C	I'll see you in a week
A	Good luck with that
C	all of those addresses between here and Brighton
C	what a pillock honestly
C	she'd have no idea
A	do you know? My
C	mm
A	erm I was living with my friend
C	yeah
A	and so
C	she didn't?
A	yeah
C	shit
A	erm
C	how big is the village?
A	mm
C	that's pretty  that's pretty  intense
A	it had three pubs
C	yeah
A	have you got it  have you got it  oh my God is it Mickey Mouse?
C	I can't but where is it meant to be
A	I have no idea
C	I don't know what that body part is
A	ugh
C	my phone goes mental whenever you turn it
A	oh yeah we're loading
A	it's just there you go
C	you might have to press load
A	play
C	what is it?
A	erm it's very neat
C	it's really detailed isn't it?
A	yeah
C	I think if you erm if you touch the screen when it's on there
A	that's pause
C	er
A	where is that?
C	play
A	right
C	where could it possibly be? Cos what is that?
A	knobbly bit
C	do you think that's his that's the top of his arm?
A	yeah
C	oh
A	who the hell has done that?
C	and why would you have it there? You certainly wouldn't have it there cos that's a mental place to have it
A	I'm gonna say where is it?
C	like if we look at the angle that the photo's taken at
A	that's a tee-shirt innit
C	it must be the top of his arm
A	yeah
C	like that bit
A	yeah
C	tell him he's a freak
A	I just
C	in the nicest possible way
A	I see what you mean though
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	no he's pretty skinny though isn't he
A	I dunno
C	well it's not his leg though is it? I mean that would be a weird place to have it as well
A	on your knee
C	on your knee yeah
A	I don't remember seeing that knobble on his shoulder before
C	erm
A	I don't remember that
C	just from knocking on doors?
A	yep
C	wow
A	I mean
C	okay
A	er yeah I think it took her about an hour and a half
C	Jesus Christ
A	yeah
A	top arm
C	top of left
A	I love it
C	two hours? Christ
A	it's really nice
C	it's lovely
A	has it? Er no
C	that's his number isn't it? Oh
A	I don't know
C	well presumably that that's his number
A	erm yeah
C	I don't know why
A	mm
C	the last time this happened and they said they were gonna send on er some questions you know about some for me to provide my feedback
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	that's the worst thing
C	and you've you've paid months bill for a phone that you can't actually use
A	use yeah
C	er well yes I erm I would have put photos on
A	ah
C	I haven't put any photos on
A	how did you just put that on then?
C	erm I put those on with Bluetooth
A	ah
C	no it's a little bit illegal
A	that's brilliant
C	erm a website called Tubidy
A	so did you have to type all the names of stuff in?
C	I just put in the name of a song
A	oh
C	erm cos this one I really wanted to listen to cos it's on This is England
A	I haven't seen that
C	it's good actually
A	mm
C	it's quite good
C	yeah you just go onto the website and then type in a song that you wanna listen to
A	oh
C	but what I wanted to do is make an album in there and just move them out so that it doesn't say download
A	put it on in the right place
C	so it doesn't know you've downloaded it
A	ah
C	I know it's pretty clever man
A	yeah
C	I just
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	yep
C	please believe me when I say that
C	it's been fun
A	it's been great
C	Don't call us
A	yeah
C	no one's having any fun anymore
C	right
A	yeah what what do we need to do here
C	I need to eat some food
A	yeah
C	maybe we should go
C	well probably all we'll do is buy mini eggs
A	I know
C	Cos that's all we ever do when we go to the Co-Op
A	yeah
C	which is fine
A	tea
C	someone asked me when I was saying yeah no I'm just living on fish finger sandwiches
A	yep
C	on a good day
A	right
C	but everyone else
A	hi
B	you alright?
C	you alright? Going out?
B	nope
A	we are too
C	we have no list
A	yeah
B	I'm getting beverages
C	are you going? Are you drinking in?
B	yep
C	were you meant to be going out?
B	yep
C	what's going on?
B	long story
C	you alright?
B	no not really but
C	I might just turn this off
A	what's not happy?
C	what's going on?
B	erm
A	yeah
B	it's no more
A	shit
B	mm
A	oh dear
B	no she's talking
A	mm
B	so it's been
A	yeah I can understand why she wouldn't
B	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I I would still expect that reaction from her
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yep
A	as long as she knows you're at the end of the phone
B	yeah no she does know that
A	no she's probably be numb for a couple of days yet
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's really really weird
C	God
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	the worst thing you could do
C	she'll talk to you when she's ready
B	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but when she comes to you just listen to her and don't don't forget about it
B	mm
A	and so maybe a few months down the line
B	mm
A	it might upset her and she'll be really angry that you don't understand that she could still be hurt by it
B	mm
A	like she'll keep it forever and ever and ever
B	mm
A	just er yeah sit sit tight
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I wasn't gonna go to the shop but I'm going to the shop now
A	the bath? Have you been in the bath?
B	I have been in the bath
A	probably not wise
B	no I'm gonna buy a four pack and that's it
A	probably better than you know
B	yeah
A	tripping on your own vomit in your sleep
B	my weekend's just gone to pot to be quite honest
A	mm
B	it really has
A	is she staying in?
B	well that's if she stays in
A	I'd tell her to stay at home if it was me
C	mm
B	but if I tell her to stay at home she's gonna think well why does he want me to stay at home
A	no she'll
B	mm
A	but hypothetically if this is true there is no way she wants to go out tomorrow
B	yeah
A	and any get out of jail free card she's gonna take it like full
B	mm
A	have fun
B	I'll probably see you in a minute anyway
A	okay
C	um a cow on a stick?
A	A cow on a stick
C	mm
A	yep yep yep yep
C	all that's happened is she's had her period
A	no
C	but then how can you be pregnant?
A	she yeah she
C	she's a miracle
A	I think the way she's described it to him
C	what it er I mean I've heard about there being spotting you know in the early days of pregnancy which is why some women don't realise they're pregnant for months
A	mm
C	but actually having a period when you think that you're pregnant is completely ridiculous
A	well she's yeah she's saying that the her last period was two weeks ago
C	nope that's bollocks
A	yeah
C	there's just no way that you can be pregnant in that amount of time
C	she's a fucking weirdo
A	yeah
C	it's just like
A	yeah
C	you can't and it's in that amount of time there's no way
A	no how could you possibly
C	there's absolutely physically no way
A	yeah
C	and there's no way you could possibly be pregnant in that  in that  amount of time
A	I sound bad but I wanna say to him how does the how could you explain to me how she's explained this to you cos I don't really get the chronological order of this
C	no right well there isn't
A	like she's taking the piss out of him bad
C	yeah
A	to throw that on him
C	there's but there was no fucking baby
A	no
C	and to see him
A	I know
C	what's happened is she's probably a bit upset that she's not pregnant
A	yeah
C	she's not lost anything
A	yeah
C	she's comparing herself to the trauma of some other woman having to lose a child
A	yeah
C	which you can't even imagine how bad that must be
A	no
C	I think she's disgusting
A	isn't she
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that Person C is right about her	Entailment
C	Cos she's
A	that's why I want to sit down
C	mm
A	for him to see it
C	mm
A	she must be mental
C	why? Because I don't think they're having much sex
A	no
C	I think they've only had sex about once since the second or third break up whatever it is
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think they have a weird relation	Entailment
A	yeah whatever
C	well it's value
A	mm
C	or he makes stuff up I don't know
A	yeah
C	what the fuck? I mean but he likes the drama
A	yeah
C	for him to have saying he's fallen deeply in love with her in a matter of moments
A	mm
C	and believing this shit though
A	it's the it's not just the believing it's the way he delivers the information
C	mm
A	like so we're both sat here and he said you know the thing I told you
C	so for like ten minutes I'm like well I know what you're talking about
A	yeah
C	I'll pretend that I'm not but it's rude
[ANNOTATION]	Person C think it was rude	Neutral
A	and I'm thinking
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	one it's rude cos there's someone else here
C	yeah
A	do you know what I mean? It's just that that drip feeding of building up the suspense like it's a play like it's not
C	yeah
A	if you were really emotionally invested in it
C	mm
A	you would if he was really really truly emotionally invested in this he would have come and said I'm actually really gutted you know how you I suppose you both have got the the kind of end of the stick now that you know we thought she was pregnant
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that she was pregnant	Neutral
C	mm
A	and you know she's lost the baby
A	you would  you would  be so
C	if you actually was gutted yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	that's really weird
A	do you know what I mean? Just the
C	mm
A	the whole thing's very strange
C	he likes the drama
A	she's nuts
C	I mean it obviously she's compensating for some horrible grizzly incidence that's happened in her past
A	no
C	and that's massively selfish
A	yeah
C	erm particularly when you're clearly mental
A	in her so in her little world apparently
C	mm
A	just just after she's had her period
C	yeah
A	how?
C	in two weeks how would you know?
A	how?
C	how would you know? Because it at which I mean I'm not I'm a bit vague on the specifics myself but it just you can't know that quickly
A	no you can't
C	mm
A	there's nothing for it to cling onto
C	it wouldn't stick yeah
A	it's not possible
C	it's very strange
A	yeah
C	because basically because she wants to be
A	yeah
C	and now she's built up this little little fantasy
A	and I want to ask him
C	well er I mean I could ask him because it's all new to me
A	yes yes yes
C	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	I'm happier with them
C	mm
A	living the lie than I am just being me
C	that's wrong isn't it
A	where's the sense in that?
C	well there's none
A	yeah
C	true fact we haven't got very far with this plan for dinner
A	ah ha ha
C	and that
A	that's not him?
C	I know that would have been really weird
B	it's annoying I get loads everyday
C	I know
B	I turn mine because of job interviews and things like that and I just get a load of shit every day
C	oh yeah
B	no not yet
A	how did it go?
B	very well actually
A	yeah?
B	yeah
C	that's what you want
A	yeah
B	er
A	I'd give them till Monday and give them a ring
B	I was gonna give them a ring Sunday
A	they might the person that you who interviewed you might not be there on the weekend
B	well that's just a risk I'm gonna have to take innit
A	yeah do it
B	yeah
C	shows you're keen
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	there's no that's you you're always better off being keen cos a lot of the times in hotels the staff the shift changes are so frequent that
B	yeah
C	mm
A	that you're so easily forgotten about
C	mm
B	yep
B	yeah
A	hmm mm mm mm mm
B	mm
A	ah
C	get it down you
A	were they on offer?
B	three quid
C	were they?
A	that's good
B	three quid for four
A	oh I think I might need I I think we might need some bud
C	I think we might need to go cos I'm flipping hungry
A	okay
B	we've got Guinness in there
A	that's for cake
C	yeah
B	ah
C	in some some some sort of hunter gatherer
A	ah
B	yeah
C	way
B	I think my Sunday night's or Sunday lunch with mother has gone to pot as well
C	oh no but it was all looking so good
B	yeah
C	ah bless her
B	yeah
C	well that'll still be as nice though
B	yeah I'm gonna get her a big bunch of flowers and that
C	mm
B	she phoned me earlier and she sounds awful
C	oh bless her
B	really awful
C	well she'll just like having everyone around
B	well plus money is tight as well this week
C	mm
B	very tight
C	were you working today?
B	yeah
C	mm
B	I say a short day
A	shit
B	started at six
C	oh yeah you did have an early start today actually yeah
B	yeah and then erm I finished at Watford by eleven
C	yeah
B	which was nice
A	I apologise for nakedness but you seriously have to see my penis
C	in the small
A	yeah
B	oh my good God
A	innit? Look at it in the light
B	that's
C	it's massive
B	you can tell that's fluid though
C	oh man
B	that's naughty
C	you can't wait till Tuesday
A	that's serious
B	that needs some
C	like before it was like a little willy
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	I I think personally you'd be better just waiting up A and E and they'll just drain it out there and then
A	you really think?
B	yeah
C	well what's the least busy time at A and E? Now probably
B	yeah before the mad rush
C	before everyone gets pissed and starts fights
B	and do it before you have any more drink
A	yeah
B	well if you need the company I'll go with you
A	can you imagine how long I'm gonna be there for
C	maybe you could round and they could tell you how long it'll be
A	mm
B	just just just say this needs to get drained out and I've been told I've gotta wait till Tuesday but it keeps growing and it's not good
C	can you not go to CamDoc's for that sort of thing?
B	no they're they're not allowed to touch you
C	they're not allowed to touch you?
B	no they're not allowed to do stitches or nothing
C	what's the point of them? Can they write prescriptions?
B	mm mm
C	okay
A	penis
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	it's not just me?
C	no no no it's definitely bigger
B	I
C	as it were
B	I'd get it drained out personally
C	well it's just uncomfortable for you isn't it? You know
A	yeah
C	it's probably bigger because
A	ah
C	can you call A and E? And find out how long the waiting time is?
A	I don't know
B	when did you? Have you phoned CamDoc at all? For advice
A	no
B	just your doctor
A	but he's he's saying that this will eventually clear itself
C	even though it's getting worse?
A	yeah
C	that's what he said yeah
B	and he
