C	ah dear
B	things like that yeah she comes up with quite a few
A	well when we come out with all all these silly sayings that we have
C	yeah
D	do you want to spend a penny?
A	yeah
C	mm

C	that's what I was going to say it's a bit bit naughty for me but I
D	yes it's nice
A	yeah
B	mm
C	it's lovely
B	and lemon you got lemon
C	and lemon
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	real lemon zest
A	yeah that's cut through
B	mm
C	it's lovely
A	brought that up especially for us
B	yeah
A	and we're sharing it with you
C	no no you can't you now see I understand what you said but when you say somebody brought that up especially for you it could mean totally different
A	well you could have brought it all all over the table you know?
B	what could have been different?
C	well
B	oh dear
A	he he did and we reconstituted when it was here and we put it all back together again this when we took the
B	don't make it worse
D	I wondered why that bottom was so thick that's been bugging me that
D	never mind
A	night before yes
C	bit
D	has she? oh
A	yeah yeah
D	she's got it yeah she said I'm I'm sneaky
A	you're sneaky? why?
D	she said the the email back was that was sneaky
B	why?
A	why was that sneaky?
D	cos she
B	cos you agreed not to give each other things
D	no no she said that was sneaky and no chocolate exclamation mark cos she's given up chocolate this month
A	oh right
D	she gave up alcohol last month she's given up chocolate this month
B	really?
C	that's good
A	but she hadn't given up alcohol altogether that was just
D	I think she needs to join the Methodists or the Baptists or something like that
A	yeah well January was
C	you don't miss it
B	oh dear
C	well it's alright they did alright out in
B	well if they'd want you to come back?
C	no they did alright after the meal and actually it didn't half brighten the place up
B	oh no no no no
C	we brightened the place up
B	mm
A	they they'd
C	we were we were we
D	well microwave probably
C	well it was perfect
D	yeah
C	and erm we were going to say oh you know when
C	so and just then her plate got collected
A	did it?
C	yeah it did we said you'll get it any moment now and sure enough it came out yeah
D	it's well if you do veg in a in a in a you know those steam bags you get in the microwave they come out beautiful
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	mm
C	right a steam bag that is why I'm going wrong where do I get a steam bag from?
B	mm
D	erm Safeway's Tesco's
C	oh okay
D	no sorry not Safeway's
C	you can't get them in Sainsbury's I like Sainsbury's now the stuff is is nice
D	overpriced
B	they are overpriced
C	no it's not if you're there at eight o'clock in the morning as you're going round they put out they put out all the stuff they want to reduce and they're mixed in with everything else they don't put it separate
D	oh right
C	and so if you're the first you know it's the early bird who'll the worm
D	oh I see but cos the Lidl's stuff's probably cheaper than their old
A	yeah
D	stuff no seriously Lidl vegetables are really are really good
C	they are yeah
B	yeah
A	Tesco's vegetables
C	Morrisons don't seem to last
A	Tesco's vegetables
C	oh I think they're awful yeah
B	I've got no complaints about Morrisons
D	but
A	we like Morrisons don't we?
D	yes
C	they I I I think where Tesco's have gone wrong is they they became too big
B	yeah
C	management had become slack
A	yeah
C	and they're used to having a job now which is not hugely demanding
A	yeah
C	cos it wasn't and they swan around doing nothing the the when you go to a Tesco's store there are always too many people doing nothing
A	yeah
D	you know and you go to pay for something and there are two people there in the Tesco garage on the way to
B	yeah
D	you put that to the side you serve the customers and then you carry on when it's quiet you know and she just ignored us
B	that's not what they do
D	and I thought that is just typical Tesco
A	mm yeah
D	you know you go to you do the you're own scanning and you go to check out and you need somebody to okay that you're over eighteen for your bottle of wine right? erm
A	yeah
D	you would think they could scan you wouldn't you?
A	you would wouldn't you?
D	and make a rough guess but anyway so you're waiting for that the red light's flashing right? and these other peoples are stood around Tesco staff are stood there doing nothing
A	yeah
C	mm
D	while you wait for the one who is meant to be doing who has probably gone off to the loo or something and finally comes back and starts doing something else and suddenly finally notices that you've got a red light flashing
A	yeah
D	and deals with it to my mind if the red light's flashing right they should be multi talking trained you haven't got a customer over there at customer services you come straight over and say right are you?
B	yeah
A	yes that's right
A	sometimes you have to wait ages when that light's flashing
D	yeah yeah and that that's that's that's wrong you see and they get that wrong all the way along
B	yeah
A	that's funny cos this morning
D	and it is that that they do wrong
C	yeah yeah
D	yeah a lot of staff
A	this morning on
D	I'm I haven't finished yet
A	yeah okay
D	they think the store is there for them to have a job
A	can I now speak?
D	yeah you can now I've finished now
A	sir please? no
D	I wanted to get that bit in
D	have you forgotten it?
A	on
D	right
A	and the police have got facial recognition all outside like in cameras all outside
D	right
A	so Tesco's will now recognise your face know what you're buying
D	yeah
A	and then you get it all sorted out for you all the time
D	what do you mean sorted out for you?
A	well you get when you go in there he is again
D	yeah
A	it's all straight they got all the stuff that you buy all stacked up and done
B	oh that's silly
D	oh I see
B	bought it this week
A	well they
A	yeah
D	so they'll have it there ready for you just to pay with the card and go
A	yeah that's it yeah
D	oh
A	supposedly
B	but you don't want things every week
D	yeah but you can probably select them can't you?
C	a lot of people shopping is the only exercise they get you know I make a point of parking away if I can and walk in and walk then the the more well the well taken to the ultimate stage people stay at home and it all gets brought to them
A	that's great
C	you know that's no good
A	that's great
C	yeah but it's no good if people need to do a little bit of exercise in their life so they're not just sat watching the box all day
D	well no if you have shopping delivered you can be at the gym while it's
A	yeah you can
B	yeah
C	yeah and pay to exercise rather than doing just
A	all round the
D	well
A	and she goes running
D	and gets the parking gets a free parking ticket
C	no there's there's a friend of mine in the TA old
D	and he jogged to work?
C	and it's expensive no it's really expensive parking in Leeds so it it was cheaper for him to buy a year's subscription to to a gym he used to park in the gym he used to go for a swim have a have a have a shower get changed
D	then go to work
C	go and walk into work from there leave his car there come back and he can have a shower at the end of the day before he went home as well
B	oh right
C	and so he got free parking for the whole day
B	wow
A	yeah
D	yeah yeah I could see that probably working actually yeah
A	yeah
C	that could work well you wouldn't get free parking for a long time in
A	well the nicest thing about living here is we can just get this
C	oh yeah
A	park up the road get on the bus and go to Norwich for nothing
C	that's right yeah I I got one of them cards too
A	yeah you haven't used yours yet have you?
C	yeah
C	are you?
A	yeah but you travel to
C	mm
D	have you got a basket on wheels?
B	no no he doesn't no
C	no there is a no there
B	no he goes to the park and ride
C	I'll work it out for you one day but erm
A	there is no need that don't matter how long it takes to get there we get there free we don't have to drive to the park and ride pay for your park and ride get on the bus
D	have you got a a a a basket on wheels for your shopping?
A	no we haven't not yet not yet
D	no I think they're a good idea actually
C	yeah
D	mum had a superb one didn't she that you pushed?
B	I suppose she did yeah that's alright if you're walking everywhere isn't it?
C	it is yeah yeah
D	but when I stop working I've got my bike all set up cos I've got my I've got by bike on this cycle to work scheme
A	oh yeah?
D	this was ages ago it was when I was at
[ANNOTATION]	They got their bike at a second hand shop.	Neutral
A	oh right yeah yeah
B	yeah
D	they had this scheme so I did this cycle to work scheme
B	yeah
D	and they
A	free bike
D	they took months to process the blasted thing months and months I I was leaving and they
C	by the time they
D	when they processed it you see and I said well I'm not going to be cycling to
A	oh wow
D	so I got my bike at half price and tax free
[ANNOTATION]	They paid full price for an ugly bike they don't even use.	Contradiction
B	yeah
C	mm mm
B	that's what
A	yes they did yeah yeah
D	yeah
A	it's a good idea
B	they just took off so much per week anyway didn't they?
A	yeah in
B	out of their wages
A	you can pick up a bike ride it to where you want leave it there somebody else will come along and pick up the bike ride it where you wanna go leave it there somebody else come along pick up the bike ride it leave it there you can leave your bikes all
D	oh the white bike scheme?
B	mm yeah
[ANNOTATION]	A says you must leave the bike back where you got it from.	Contradiction
D	yeah they did that in Oxford as well but the people started nicking them by the lorry load
A	did they?
D	well they turned up at night and just loaded them on the lorry and drove off
A	did they? oh god
B	mm
D	you see which is a shame cos that's a nice way of doing it
A	yes it is
B	it is lovely yeah
A	yeah well they still they still
[ANNOTATION]	It didn't work out in Oxford.	Entailment
B	well usually they're so old looking aren't they?
A	yeah
D	yeah but they've
[ANNOTATION]	These bikes are usually from the second world war.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	mm yeah
D	they wouldn't have been sold in this country
B	no
D	they all
C	they sent they sent a load out to erm Gambia once cos the kids walked about sort of four miles to school and four miles back
D	that's right yeah yeah
C	so they gave them to kids but when they left the school they had to hand them in they were for kids to use at the school
[ANNOTATION]	The kids could keep the bikes once they were done with school.	Contradiction
A	yeah
D	every pupil gets one
A	Samsung help with that
D	right they pay a deposit and they have to return it when they leave right?
C	mm
B	yeah
D	alright? the thing is they buy them in bulk you you can get them now for probably forty forty pound I should think
A	yeah yeah
D	if you buy in bulk yeah? erm and what's brilliant about it they've all got a Chrome book right? so they can all log onto Google Drive
A	mm
D	yeah? as an educational establishment if you join Google Drive
A	wow
D	okay? and all your pupils you can set them up with a Gmail account in advance and you can do that on the you can't do that unless you you've enrolled
A	no
D	it doesn't cost anything
A	no
D	right? all Google wants is to people to be thinking Google
A	yeah
D	there's nothing else in it for them
A	no
D	no advertising on it at all so when they log on to Google drive you don't have to have any there's no software on a Chromebook you see? cos you go in the cloud and you use the word processor and the Excel well not Excel but the spreadsheet the presentation software that's on Google Drive so it's all in the cloud right?
C	yeah
D	erm all their they have access to folders cos if you if you set up Google Drive you can give different people access to different folders to see different folders of yours you can share the access with them so those who are on the geography GCSE course the head of geography shares or somebody on the behalf of them shares all the folders that they need for their geography work so the reading material the assignments the homework it's all there
A	wow
C	clever innit?
D	right so you don't need to hand out you don't need to print off homework sheets
C	yeah
D	so all that photocopying during the year you don't have to do assignments are handed in online
B	yeah
D	you don't have it's absolutely superb yeah
B	brilliant
C	but how do you know the person who's got that book is actually the the lad that's supposed to be doing the work to hand in the assignment could he?
D	you don't no
C	could he give it to his brother to do all the work and then put
D	yes but they can do you can do that anyway
B	yeah
C	homework
D	there's no difference
A	homework
B	yeah
A	you get homework from the teacher
D	you know do you have samples of their handwriting when you're marking to check it's their hand writing? no
B	yeah
C	but you you get to know a lot of people's handwriting
D	precisely so that's all you need so if the work clearly is way above their ability
C	then I suppose how
B	yeah you have to question it
D	and lots of schools and colleges they use what's called turn it in which will scan
C	oh I see right
D	right? well it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't but it it's reasonably reliable at picking out passages that have been copied off the internet
C	didn't they they do that for the end of of uni don't they I think?
D	yeah unis use turn it in as well yeah yeah
C	so they so they know you haven't pinched it all off the internet
B	mm
D	that's right
A	yeah
C	the only only thing I'd
A	this is a problem
D	well the question is do you need to
D	well how can it?
C	if there's a big war and infrastructure gets zapped then it'll all pack up
A	plus
D	the Ukraine
C	but you need power to charge them
D	huh?
C	you need power to charge them if if you so what do you do?
D	yeah
A	but there's also
D	generator generator
A	there's also a growing sun spot
C	no fuel
D	what?
C	no fuel
D	well in that case you're kaput anyway
C	but if you
B	yeah
D	you know if if so if you're down to the level where you've got no electricity no fuel nothing
C	mm
D	well everything's gone
B	yeah
D	you know? forget about technology your food processing won't take place
C	well that's true but but but it's getting you at the minute we could go back to basics couldn't we? the real basics we've still got cash we can still write
D	yeah
C	and we we we know how to cook we know how to forage we know the things we
D	sorry no gas I thought you said no fuel?
C	no no we wood
B	no yeah
C	wood
D	yeah but
C	pot outside
D	yeah but
B	it would be
C	it would be difficult but we could cope and we could cope and we could keep warm and we could survive but when you get
B	I still think
C	then
D	they could still go out in the wood and chop some wood
B	still most most people would
D	you'd do the basics you'd just forget about the rest but the rest will go anyway you know but I mean everything will go if you've got no fuel nobody is going to be delivering food to the shops
C	no
D	there'll be no food moving around
A	no
D	you'd have to go forage for yourself so
D	mm
C	and if that got into it and then the whole all the electrics went
D	mm
C	I know but but once it's flooded then you can't you've got to unflood it to get it going again haven't you? and then and then that would probably knock out other bits so
D	no it won't cos it's their own
C	oh okay well
B	yeah but if everything did go
C	if everything did go in the whole of London
D	yeah yeah
C	erm there's no power at all in the whole of London
C	mm
C	absolute chaos wouldn't that be?
B	it would be
D	it would be yeah yeah
C	cos everything would stop nothing would be able to work cos it has to be
A	there's one of the thing that can wipe out just about every computer in the world and that's the sun
C	well there's the what is it they taught us in the army? there's electromagnetic force
A	there's sun spots
C	EMF yeah which comes from the sun
A	sun spots which come from the sun and they
C	yeah
A	they they can they can wipe out all the satellites the whole lot of them
C	mm
A	yeah but you wouldn't you wouldn't get the cloud anymore you wouldn't get all the because that'll work from the satellites
D	no it doesn't the cloud is nothing I thought that
A	did you?
D	the word
C	it's not
D	they're all on the ground
C	mm
A	oh right
C	a lot of the the the
A	nevertheless that would wipe out a lot of
D	I
A	yes
D	and it's not no in actual fact they tend to be in the cold areas of of of the world
B	oh right
D	right? near the poles so that they don't have to cool them
A	have you seen Google's?
B	oh
C	it's not one there's lots of them lots of them all working together yeah
D	oh there's loads of them all over the place
A	have you seen Google Google's stuff that they got their their their er what do you call them?
C	right
A	and the heat that's why the keep them up there up there the heat is so intense coming off they have to keep them
C	that's why
A	cool
C	the
A	are melting
D	it's the hard drive Google's hard drive
C	yes
C	yes it is
D	I don't think I don't think it I think the
C	yes we are
D	okay
C	but we've been in both
C	it's exactly the same thing
A	they had riots
D	you know we use to have potters and weavers and so on it's all now done in a factory what happens if the factory shuts down? nobody is gonna have any shoes or any pots or any clothes
C	mm mm
A	yeah oh
A	yeah he's English
C	he's he's worried about he's worried about some of the erm
A	or British
C	of the way the way it's going and I can't remember what it was it was it was yesterday I read it
D	oh right
C	I read it on the BBC News on the internet and he's
A	he actually gave it to the world
C	mm
C	maybe it was to do with erm these television these Samsung televisions that actually could listen in to your conversation
A	oh isn't that terrible?
B	yeah
C	yeah but but how do we know there's not loads more things like that?
D	they could well
C	how do we know they're not listening in on the cloud to what's going on here there and everywhere?
A	well they probably do
D	they do
A	yeah
D	every single mobile call is recorded
C	oh and yeah yeah
A	and every single email can be read by the GHQ in England or in America
C	mm
B	we thought a long time ago that television
D	they they don't seem to do it very well do they? cos
A	well yeah and what they do is look for key words
A	key words if they look at we we have a programme well we've probably told you about this we had a programme on our first IBM computer right? and we could talk and it was voice recognition and everything and we talked into it didn't we?
D	mm
B	we talked into it and it prints out
A	and then it printed out what we said
D	yeah
A	well according to what we'd said we'd said that Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were getting ready for a world war
A	and we were only talking like what you and I are talking now
B	yeah and then we thought we'd read out of a book like Jack and the Beanstalk
A	yeah Jack and the Beanstalk
B	and it was the same kind of thing
A	and it came out the same thing
D	well there we are
B	mm
A	and this was an IBM computer so you know nowadays we'd have had the FBI round here with guns and what have you
B	obviously it's more sophisticated now
A	well that is more sophisticated now but it weren't then were it?
B	you can ask them questions can't you?
A	but don't it make you wonder what's going to happen in twenty thirty years time?
B	mm
A	where will the world be then?
C	ah I dread to think with the way things are going
A	we'll have chips on like like your dog
C	mm?
B	yeah I'm sure we will
A	we'll have chips
B	chips
C	that
D	oh yeah yeah
C	and and the tube is cut at a slant a sharp slant and she just got down on the floor with
D	yeah
C	just just er pinched his skin together and went
D	yeah yeah
C	you see
D	well when did you get
C	recently it was free when
B	oh
C	was it when were you there with?
D	it was free?
C	no no day day before yesterday
D	why was it free?
C	it's it's it's being paid for by the dog's homing trust
B	if you have something else
C	yeah yeah
B	annual check or something
C	they just you know it was fifty pound for the annual check and all the stuff
B	mm
C	erm forty-five and then it's fifty pounds for his wormer and stuff
B	right
C	wasn't it? this last time erm they they've now just sent out a thing that it it all fell to bits that veterinary practice cos the two key people went off and set up another one they wanted to buy it they weren't allowed to they set up another one in
B	I don't know
C	lovely lady and there's a Polish lass as well there's two others so they've got four vets and they've just put out another bumf about who they are all the new vets are there and I met the two of them and they're brilliant and they they're starting a healthy pet club and for nine ninety-nine per that's the lowest maybe it goes up with the age of the dog nine ninety-nine a month you get everything you get your flee your worm two annual checks erm and a few other things on the list erm and that'll work out far cheaper cos at the minute you know before lots of just before lots of medicine for Tobyover the year every three months you've got to do him that comes to erm that's a hundred two hundred pound
B	mm
C	that's two hundred pound and this this if it's nine ninety-nine a month what's that that's?
D	sounds a bargain
C	it's an absolute bargain
D	okay get signed up
C	hundred
A	yeah
C	hundred a twenty for the lot
B	as long as it includes everything you're used to
C	oh it'll be the same stuff cos they that's what they
B	good
A	sounds good
C	so so that sounds good so I think I'm going to go for that
B	but don't do it yet
C	which is no good what's the point in having a vet in
B	don't join them yet
A	well that's just
C	and is bleeding you've got to got to drive to
A	that's the same with er what's the point in having a dentist in London
D	we'll leave that one I think
B	yeah
C	oh there is there is a good reason for that
C	he's fantastic he's very good
A	yeah
B	you do seem to go more often than we do we only go every nine months
C	it's twice
D	well I went to the dentist last
A	yeah?
D	and he did that you know that very high white grating ultra cleaning thing
A	oh right oh sounds horrible
D	right
A	yeah
D	yeah and then
D	and he said oh everything's absolutely fine I'll just give them a quick clean for you and I think the vibrator just loosened it all up
B	well I I won't have it and
D	so I'm gonna go back again
A	no you don't no
B	the cleaning cos I don't like it anyway cos it hurts my teeth for about three weeks
C	yeah yeah yeah mine puts a funny brush in the paste
A	yeah
C	he has a brush and he dips it in some paste and and he does it he's he's not he's not the hygienist it's not something they normally do they have a separate hygienist cos he knows I come his parents live at
B	yeah well I don't
C	part of the inspection
B	I'm not going to have it er done again cos I
A	yeah
C	well you want it come out so that the
B	not really no
D	it was probably loose anyway
C	it would have come out eventually
B	well I don't
A	yes well you're you're filling fell out was that? vibrated out?
D	probably yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	let me see what
B	is she still there?
C	she's still there yeah but she's worked her way up now she's his nurse they're a brilliant team
D	I've got a wisdom tooth coming through
C	but it's kind of embarrassing cos it's
A	now you will be wise
D	it's a bit sideways no all the others I've had this is my last one
C	oh right
D	cos you either get them early or you get them late don't you?
C	mm
A	yeah
B	mm
C	that's why they give them
D	and it's it's a bit tight behind this molar at the back and it's coming out a bit sideways
C	oh they might have to pull it
B	that's how mine was and they decided to move it remove it
A	oh you had to go to hospital didn't you?
B	mm
C	you do for something like that
B	they wanted to save the
C	oh that's unless they're a surgeon is is if they're if he's
D	yeah mine mine do surgical yeah but he er he he he thinks it's alright at the moment
A	yeah but it's free free in hospital
D	oh right
A	there you go see
B	he said I had to go to hospital he said
A	he said you had to go to hospital so he did
C	well he so he might not have been a surgeon he might have been a dental practitioner
D	I'll tell you what he said on mine
B	they did put me out though
C	yeah they can do that
D	he gave me a prescription for erm this Colgate toothpaste that's higher in fluoride you can't buy it over the counter
C	oh right
D	you oh sorry no you can't buy it from a an ordinary chemist you have you can buy it from the dentist or you can get a prescription you get it from the chemist
C	yeah
D	er so because I'm over sixty he gave me the prescription and erm what it does it people with softer teeth even when you're older it reduces the amount of work you have to have done cos you've got the fluoride
A	yeah
C	oh I'll ask him
B	I don't want to touch any to touch any fluoride
D	I can tell you the name of the stuff if you want? you brush them at the end of
C	mm mm
B	oh
D	you just spit
B	oh don't like that
D	because then it leaves well it leaves some of the fluoride there what it says is ideally you you don't want to
B	you should
D	and it builds up the fluoride in that but
C	well that's good that sounds good
B	I always rinse it really well but maybe you shouldn't
C	well if you want to find out about ask
D	oh yeah yes oh it's the same I'll bring the tube down yeah
C	she'll tell you about it I didn't realise then the other day I looked at the Macleans packet that's GSK as well so Macleans Aquafresh and Sensodyne they're all GSK but I didn't know the Macleans was
A	oh right no didn't
C	I just buy what's cheapest I mean
A	so do we yeah
C	when it's on offer
B	yeah you get it for fifty pence if you're
C	I got it
A	if you're lucky yeah
B	yeah cos we left our all our wash stuff at at
C	need to cover this up
B	cos we we were off on holiday so we had to stop off and get something and we said
A	yeah we did yeah
B	pack of two and erm fifty pence
A	toothpaste yeah
B	paste and it's brilliant toothpaste
A	yeah it was
B	nice
C	at at at our show two years ago there was Colgate took a stand right in a prominent position
C	oh yeah that's not
D	this is five thousand you see
C	yeah yeah and you can see that's not a retail pack cos no one would be encouraged to buy that the way it is
D	well the box is quite nice to
C	well
B	one gram contains five milligrams of fluoride
C	Duraphat
B	corresponding to five thousand
C	parts per parts per millilitre
B	is it?
C	probably PPM
D	I think it's normally about a thousand in the normal toothpaste so it's five times but
C	no
B	no
D	erm
A	they won't
C	in the water it's in the water now?
A	that's in the water yeah
D	I think if we'd had fluoride tablets when we were kids our teeth probably would have been much better
A	yeah
C	that's right we had awful teeth haven't we?
D	yeah
B	well there's fluoride water in when we came to Norwich so
A	yeah
C	well anyway
B	and buy tablets
C	when when Colgate took a stand at the
A	yeah
C	with free Colgate free toothbrush and all sorts of bits and pieces in the bag to everybody at the show and I got one I thought ah I could
A	yeah
C	she said I I can use this idea and she'd probably feed the idea as as coming from her but Colgate they were really clever cos the guy theyhad a photographer they had a photographer that was there
A	oh yeah yeah
C	and come down the ramp the other end they were doing that and he said can I go? can I nip through? and he must
B	oh right
A	oh right
C	and so that was I don't know if he could use it without their permission but
D	no
C	but but if if you wanted if they wanted to
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	erm it it would cost a fortune wouldn't it?
D	oh yeah
C	so maybe he'd take the pictures and then say well can we use it and we'll pay you so and so probably probably that way round might work
A	we were gonna go and play weren't we?
D	yeah yeah can we just check to see if we can get that sleeve finish that order
A	yeah we can finish the order yeah
D	and then we'll do it okay?
C	well I'm going to try I'm going to try and make
D	no we haven't we haven't found the right
A	no we haven't have we? no
D	yeah
B	mm
D	er but it can't be difficult
B	yeah
A	that's all it needs yeah
D	my lathe is a different size thread it's a smaller thread there are two basic sizes
A	it's
D	mine is three quarter and his is
C	so you can't swap and change bits and pieces without this this
A	no
D	well there's an adapter for the other one
C	I I'll go another one it's not going to
D	yeah
C	well can you go bigger or?
D	you can put the little one of the big one
A	yeah
D	but we can't
A	but we can't put the big one on the little one
C	it must it must exist then
D	there must be yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	there there the Chinese will have one
B	yeah
C	the Chinese will have one
B	mm sound exhausted
C	well that it it where's when Maysie's walking Maysie's she's like this now she's thirteen
B	yeah
C	and this this leg her back leg if if she overdoes it that leg it she had it it starts trailing and she scoops her you know it could like that her toes you can hear her nails scratching on the ground she can't lift the leg but she wants to walk
B	mm
D	but she did come round but she gets slower and slower and slower but
B	right
C	yeah
B	her back yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
B	yeah
C	she says I've been looking for I've been looking for a valentine card she said you
B	yeah yeah
C	so I put I put them on and erm but mine wasn't sloppy either you know neither of us did a sloppy one it was a nice little one she'd hand written the inside it was nice
B	yeah
C	it was good
B	so she gave you a sloppy one
C	no it wasn't no no no mine says erm I'm so pleased we've been put on the same path so happy
B	oh yeah
C	erm that this was all when we went to
B	you drew it did you?
C	no no the photographs I'd taken when she was with me
B	oh I see oh yeah
C	and then erm and it's an adventurous path and there's she's on the beach with three dogs
B	right
C	stood all round her you see?
B	mm
C	and then adventurous one and a beautiful and peaceful one and that was oh erm there weren't so pleased we'd been put on the same path was just a path going through the snowdrops
B	oh lovely
C	at
B	worked well then
C	there and on the back there was a picture of oh there was a picture of just one or just a clump of snowdrops erm yeah it er and and she looked at it and thought how did you since I was
B	yeah
C	have you got it at from
B	yeah
C	that's what she thought then when she opened it up and saw her picture in it
B	oh
C	realised it wasn't but if I hadn't have put her in it
B	yeah
C	actually I couldn't do cards for
B	yeah course you could
C	because they they're nice little Christian cards erm and and people would understand the way I've written it that it's a Christian card
B	yeah
C	so I don't know I'm there's so many there's so many things I can do
B	yeah
C	but I seem to get snowed under with these ridiculous
B	we're planning an open studio
C	are you? okay
B	erm
C	right
B	and and bringing her stuff
C	yes I know
B	you're gonna say something now
C	I'd have an
B	yeah
C	who?
B	right
C	erm so erm what one one of my thoughts were that when the heritage lottery goes through and we get the tower done it's now gonna help getting the tower done if we've got something really important in there can't let it fall down around that
B	yeah
C	so erm is that when it's open we if we remove some of pews at the back we can have an area where people local crafts could be sold
B	yeah
C	if we're gonna get more people coming
B	yeah
C	I know you'll say that they're not gonna come but it they may well do when they know about this so
B	they might do but
C	but then we've got to have extra car parking and everything down there as well
B	isn't it one of the little churches that should be left as as it is?
C	no what I'm thinking is at the back if if say that's that's the
B	right
C	now if when you come in the door where we stand when we have you know it's a good place for social as well
B	yeah
C	we never used to have pews in its people would stand
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	the font's there
B	yeah
C	all these old folk are stood around you know propping themselves up here there and everywhere round that
B	yeah
C	if one of the part of the plan is that
B	yeah
C	there the loo's got to go in the tower
B	are there loos there now?
C	no you go round the back of the church
B	yeah well I don't think there should be loos
C	you just wanna go and piddle round the back of the church do you?
B	no
C	you can't invite people to come expect people to come and visit the church if there's no loos in the area
B	but there is in the in the hall isn't there?
C	yeah but yes but in the winter
B	yeah but it's so
C	mm that's that's
B	they should they should keep the church as a historical building
C	cos then you take out all the pews cos the everyone used to just stand in it and the vicar used to park his horse in it and
B	oh
C	and it had a and it had a
B	yeah you're going to extremes now
C	no I'm not he used to park his horse and it had a it had a
B	that's the history
C	so you keep improving it everyone that's been there has improved every church evolves with the people church is for people
B	yes
C	we don't own the church the church belongs to the village we just happen to be using it
B	well I know that yeah
C	and looking after it erm but if that had erm that little kitchenette there so you can make cups of tea that's basically what it's for then there was a little area in front of that where you remove say two pews and you and put a table in the middle and people sit looking at each other
B	mm
C	erm the
B	yeah
C	but you could also and then I've seen it done in my old church at
B	no one uses the hall and it's right next door
C	yes
B	no one uses the hall do they? on a Sunday
C	no
B	so why can't they just move across to there and have a lovely get together with all the little tables and they got the kitchen there?
C	well
B	and the loos
C	I'll tell you why it can't happen
B	why?
C	why it can't happen is because heritage lottery will not fund just to repair something they will only fund
B	well
C	they won't repair the tower if we don't make an effort to make it better when people visit
B	mm
C	it's got to be free
B	okay
C	and one of the things that they suggest is to put in a loo and to have a little tea making corner
B	really?
C	for people that visit so it's it makes it
B	yeah it just it just seems a bit silly when right next door they've got all the cups and saucers and everything there
C	mm
B	yeah
C	and you want a cup of tea at the end of the service do you want to then
B	you've still got to leave haven't you?
C	lock the church up walk walk through the snow to get to
B	no I don't think that's a problem
C	to the hall? it's
B	the distance is not a problem
C	but if we didn't ask to do things like that they wouldn't repair the tower
B	right
C	that's the part that's the point
B	seems that seems rotten to me
C	well they won't repair the tower unless you make it accessible to everybody that building
B	yeah
C	so that's what
B	there must be a cos it's an it's a protected building isn't it?
C	yeah they're all they're all
B	they're all erm
C	they're all graded yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	that's a grade two listed
B	so you've got to be very careful how what you do
C	I know I know yeah so we don't can't can't spoil the fabric at all we won't be spoiling the fabric
B	oh oh
C	look what we do at
B	I know
C	look what we can do there it's wonderful
B	yeah
C	so many things and you just move the chairs around
B	mm
C	the only pew the pews were the best that people could do
B	yeah I
C	after people were standing
B	I kind of agree that
C	you see?
B	pews aren't the best
C	but there's twelve of us go every Sunday and the all these pews are all empty
B	twelve at
C	yeah
B	yeah right
C	so there's only about twelve of us going but if you can encourage people to come more people to come to the place they you they won't fund it unless you're improving it for people to come to it and part of it will be having erm a new path so you can get wheelchairs up there
B	yeah a new path that makes sense yeah
C	chairs up there a path possibly going across cutting across which may be difficult cos it'll go across some graves but easier to get to the hall
B	mm
C	erm
B	yeah
C	the dog tap in in bottles and leave it in bottles in the tower
B	mm
C	and we've got tea making stuff in the tower which is just a urn that warms up you see but there's nowhere to sit cos you can't sit all facing
B	but that's why I think why go to all that trouble when you have a purpose built building right next door?
C	but it's no good in the winter if you've got the people going would you how would you like it? alright you're living in here and your kitchen is over there outside
B	yeah yeah but it's a church service
C	if you
A	what's that? what are you talking about?
C	well well
B	when we're going to have erm
C	well when we had when we had the the folk group when we had the folk group we had the folk group
A	yeah
C	played
A	yeah
C	erm everyone had to go across and get their drinks from the hall and carry it back now that was fine unless it's bunging it with rain
A	yeah
C	erm you see it it it it you it's as if erm right you're inviting people to one place and all the facilities are in the house next door
B	I just don't think that's
C	it's like you wouldn't have a village here you had to go to the house next door to use the facilities would you?
D	unless
B	yeah
C	that's what it is but they won't cos the main thing is they will not fund repairs unless it improves the accessibility for everybody
B	mm
C	and that's disabled access a loo is imperative erm you know
B	yeah
C	and
B	mm
C	and so
B	yeah
C	cos he couldn't get he couldn't get to the hall
B	yeah mm
C	so I think it is important
B	yeah
C	it's not and it's not nice I mean I don't mind that I mean like I don't mind helping
B	mm
C	I think erm well it and the other thing is that the church actually suits some events better than the hall
B	yeah
C	in the church than than the hall so it would be good if if there was anything and then they can work together that's not it's not there's not two separate things they can work together but the only way we can get the tower repaired is to make it all work
B	yeah
C	and they're even thinking about they're even thinking about trying to sort out somewhere a field somewhere for a car park because there's always a problem when there's an event there
B	yeah
C	in the hall whether it be in the hall or the church
B	yeah
C	so there needs to be a car park somewhere you know just erm gently just so it's not doesn't upset erm but I'm sure it we will get it sorted
B	well they they have to don't they?
C	yeah they have to
B	they have to do it
C	well I mean it doesn't matter to us because
B	it's a listed building
C	yeah but we don't have to do it we can say go well okay I suppose ultimately if we can't get it repaired we just go and worship in we could hire the hall for six pounds an hour on a Sunday morning no worries worship in the hall and let the tower fall down but that's not not really an option but that's you could say well okay well we'll worship in the hall
B	yeah
C	because we can't go in there cos the tower's falling down
B	mm
C	it's a lovely spot that have you seen what they've done right round the work they've put in?
B	they thought it was going to be up for sale when we first came here
C	mm? what the hall?
B	the church
C	the church did they?
B	mm
C	oh cos there was nobody using it
B	yeah
C	ah
B	they thought it might go up for sale
C	mm mm
B	like lots of churches need lots of people
C	yeah but what? I don't know what you could do that I'm sure I mean it would cost you
B	yeah
C	and that's without anything else
B	mm
C	without doing the the path to it and
C	the road needs doing outside as well that maybe we could include that you see? improve the road
B	yeah yeah
C	erm but it's a chance this is a chance
B	it does need doing that's right
C	we've got a chance to improve that whole area down there
B	right
C	look how it it's churned up in the winter
B	so how much will they give?
C	mm?
B	how much will they give then?
C	you can ask for what you want
B	oh I see
C	providing they think it's a good thing
B	yeah
C	erm but it's got to involve the community
B	mm
C	and improving it and improving all the access
B	which means they've got to pay more than just for the tower anyway
C	and interest
B	got a lot more a lot more
C	they they they won't if you just said we just want the tower doing they wouldn't do it cos you're not improving the place for
B	right
C	it's not just the building they are interested in attracting more people to see the beauty of the building
B	yeah mm mm
C	that's that's what they're trying to get
B	yeah
C	things like that but erm
B	mm
C	it
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is a model	Neutral
B	to what?
C	to head it up they want one person one person needs to be in charge of
B	yes yeah
C	one person but we're all got jobs every every one of us that goes to that church does something
B	yeah
C	whether it be cleaning or or doing the catering for it or cleaning the outside area and maintaining it or doing
B	mm
C	and
B	yeah
C	and we haven't found that person yet I I you know keep looking
B	could be you couldn't it?
C	well it could be if I didn't have anything else to do
B	well
[ANNOTATION]	everyone in the church has a task to do	Entailment
C	well I don't know but at the minute I'm still

B	mm?
C	I probably could yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is a singer songwriter	Neutral
B	mm
C	I think I mean and we need a team as well you see? and no one's volunteered for the team either we all do our bits and keeping things as it is but it and erm
B	mm
C	I thought see a lot of them they are retired a lot of them are retired but they they feel it's gonna be one
B	yeah you can't take too much on
C	I don't think I could take on another one of something
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is going to the beach this weekend	Neutral
B	no
C	but we'll see but the point is well I I'm
B	yeah
C	is that when the church is it's gonna be open Wednesdays
