C	one and a half million?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	people are so
B	but they're beautiful they did show some beautiful places
A	they did yeah but
C	well but well have you got one and a half million to spend on a property? you've obviously
B	I'll go and put the kettle on would you like a cup of tea?
A	no thank you
C	you've obviously got enough spare to have somebody look after it?
A	yeah
C	because a property that worth that much would be huge wouldn't it and you'd
A	well they've just moved
C	have your staff and all sorts
A	they've just moved from
B	mm
C	yeah oh well
C	does it
B	oh
A	you've got to have a cup of tea
C	twenty to four
A	yeah
B	do you want one or not?
A	did you get wet?
C	oh actually I wouldn't mind one are you having one anyway?
B	I'll have one
C	yeah yes please yes erm well it was cold there was a cold wind but it was nice
A	yeah
C	what's handy is having somebody else to stand back and
A	yeah
C	otherwise I've got to keep tweaking it and having a look
A	oh I see yeah yeah
C	erm but he didn't get it level although he said it was level so
A	now we can talk properly I can see you
C	yeah so it's another job out the way
A	yeah
C	now tonight I've got to make the
A	yeah
C	but they don't want the heavy board because they've put the wrong tacks you know they
A	oh yeah
C	so I have got some two mil two mil board
C	pardon?
A	doesn't that catch the wind?
C	well I think if they tack it around the edge and it can't get the wind underneath it can it?
A	no
C	so that's their problem
A	it is yeah
C	but that's what they want because it's difficult because it's got a picture they've got a big Father Christmas and Father Christmas oh actually
A	yeah
C	or do it the same way I did the banner for this just got one two three four layers
A	yeah
C	erm cos at that size across the top Father Christmas is he's gonna well if it's two foot part of the Christmas he's gonna almost be as oh he's gonna he's almost gonna be as big as he
A	yeah
C	what he is on the banner isn't he?
A	yeah of course he is yeah
C	there's no point printing it I'll I'll chop up
A	yeah
C	a couple of
A	yeah oh
C	right another job well done
C	they ought to have one for oh and
B	you put the lights on didn't you?
C	and I came past
A	yes that's why the lights are on
C	and I came past
A	you nutcase
C	the
A	oh crikey yeah
C	and there's nothing pulling out sideways so they've just tied it up and down in the middle of well it's not gonna stay
A	where is it?
C	on the corner by the road it's not gonna stay
A	oh that one I've seen that yeah
C	but they had a most rubbish one there for the they had a summer fair and I put that up but I've never seen such a cheap banner it had no hems the eyelets went rusty in two weeks and a big expanse of white hardly any writing on it but it was a pale colour
A	yeah so you're gonna
C	so they really they they got got rich making it whoever made it because they didn't do anything and it hardly used any ink
A	yeah
C	to colour it erm it looked all washed out and you couldn't read it
A	oh
C	and this one's no better so it's for the Christmas tree thing I went to that once and I thought no never again it was the the lighting of the Christmas tree and it was the biggest flop ever and and I think that and it and people went last year said why did we bother?
A	yeah
C	probably they just wanna switch it on don't they?
A	yeah
C	yeah and have done with it just lower the switch when no one's there and leave it on but to gather people together to throw a switch to see a mediocre sized Christmas tree with white well okay it's white
A	yeah
C	oh well
A	still there you go
C	there you go yeah
A	so you got it up and you didn't get too wet then?
C	not too bad no no because I I was I knew I was under the trees a big yew tree there you see
A	yeah
C	and I found an old I I remember I had erm
A	oh right
C	erm and one I chopped up in several bits to put in my rucksack for when I go walking
A	yeah
C	so I used one of those just chopped it up a bit and that just to protected the tree cos one tree didn't look very good actually the bark well it looks as if it's dying and I don't want to be held responsible for it
A	no
C	so I've put this padding on
A	yeah
C	and pulled the rope around it
A	what tree is that around around the back is it?
C	which?
A	no I'm saying on the on the main bit is it?
C	yeah if you look if you stood on a triangle looking at the
A	yeah
C	it's to the right there's a yew tree and there's another another tree to the right and that's just I've just put the ropes between the two over the years I've learnt exactly how to do it you know you go you go if it's a two foot banner you do two foot six between the ropes and when you're tightening them up you do them as tight as you can
A	yeah
C	two foot six apart lined up
A	yeah
C	start the banner at one end which is the most you know where you can see it the best and get ropes ready to pull it tight the other end and then when it tightens up you can adjust how it goes depending how you pull it between the two
A	yeah
C	erm and then and the other
A	yeah
C	cos I've
C	I don't know what
A	oh is it
A	yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah well when
A	oh is she? oh right
C	yeah and er
A	yeah
C	but the same prison where she was a warder
A	yeah?
C	that's the one down
A	oh right
C	I think I think
A	what
C	yeah I think he was
A	yeah
C	so he's he's he like he likes precision and things and he he did ask me to get it done last week and I couldn't
A	no
C	you see so he and he and he
A	yeah
C	singing carols erm and there's you've got
A	yeah
C	she's just a reader but she's she's so clever she actually works in an architect's office surveyor's officer
A	right
C	but she's brilliant when she talks cos she doesn't she never uses any notes and it's always related to something in her life
A	yeah
C	and it just flows you know it's wonderful
A	yeah some people are really good storytellers aren't they?
C	oh yes she's marvellous
B	mm
C	she's marvellous erm so she
A	yeah
C	depending on what they haven't written the service yet they've got far too many they they they've got a list of carols we might be singing but that's too many and then there's free mulled wine and mince pies afterwards
A	lovely
C	you see?
B	mm
C	no these are old fashioned no

A	I mean we call it traditional but that really er that was really born
C	mm
A	they were the they were the ones that promoted Christmas as it is today
C	yes and and and that's what you get used to you like you like the familiarity of it
A	you do
B	yeah
C	there's there's a comfort in familiarity
A	there is
B	yeah
C	so even what with the bell ringing stuff although it's written for up to twenty-four bells erm or even more actually we have more
A	no
C	erm but we're ringing twelve bell stuff cos you can't fit much more through

C	yeah I'll have to have a look I meant to when
A	yeah there's different shades of red yeah
C	give give give have have a different value
A	yeah
C	erm and he wanted to know that if you could have a look at one and match another one to it somehow
A	yeah
C	on a computer I don't know
A	is he a multimillionaire and don't know about it?
B	yeah
A	I mean you've even got that signed
C	I have The Shadows one up there

C	it's probably it's probably well warped now
C	yeah
A	you know how much I sold my Beatles record for?
C	mm
A	yeah
C	mm I think with those records the thing is to I'd get in touch with
B	yeah I know but do it
C	but he's he he he is a that's what he was you know he was slightly peculiar? well he wasn't he he's you know learning difficulties but what he is brilliant at he can tell you anything about vinyl records the whole
B	yeah
C	he knows exactly what they're worth and how many of them were done and also you know he's he's he's brilliant in fact perhaps he was autistic or something but he he's latched onto that and that's his expertise
A	yeah
C	he doesn't use it he works in Marks and Spencer's I think or Waitrose or something
C	no no no no
A	oh
C	he erm
A	yeah but you say you'll do these things
C	I know
A	and you never give you never
B	well I don't think you should go to to the one you know
A	no
C	no
A	what you've got to do is look on the net to see how much it's worth
B	yeah
C	mm
B	mm
A	so you
C	it might be in the
A	yeah
C	they might be all stuck together now
B	you should yeah you should spend time and find out these things
A	I bet you'll go away here and forget that er
C	well I've got all these people that are pestering me that er that are worried that stuff's not gonna be done for Christmas so I need I need to get that out the way cos it worries me erm
B	what's this?
C	just well I've got jobs that have got to be done before Christmas cos otherwise there's no point doing them because they're for Christmas mostly
B	yeah
C	so so I've got to get I mean like this Santa special and they've already had three banners at ninety-five pound each and they want three banners at ninety-five pounds each they had one banner that was a for the Christmas jazz special train and er I don't know whether well money gets donated doesn't it they're a charity? and now they want three A ones done for Father Christmas specials and one of them's gonna be right above where they've got the banner what is the point?
A	well if they're gonna pay you that doesn't matter does it?
B	no
C	no no
A	I mean it's up to them sticking it where they want
B	mm
C	oh I know but some
B	yeah
C	I just saw in the paper was it in the paper I saw it or was it? some Methodist church somewhere have er er booked the
A	oh right yeah
C	well we've been told that we shouldn't book the
A	oh dear
C	you can't put them all in the same together but er
A	he was actually prosecuted?
C	yes yes
A	oh right is he still there working for them?
C	I don't know I don't know but it's it was suggested that we shouldn't this year this Christmas anyway book the
A	ah well Christmas is all about forgiveness isn't it?
C	well I know it is this is why it's a difficult one
A	yeah
C	anyhow so we have the bell ringers anyway and we've had the
A	have you? oh why don't you get the Songbirds?
C	well perhaps we'll try them yeah we've only we've had the same choir for two years
A	are they still going the
C	mm?
A	are they still going?
C	yes I think so I think so
C	erm we've had the same choir for two years running and er but it's good to have the bells it's nice
A	yeah
C	I might actually we'll see how this goes and then once
A	yeah
C	that'll be good but they have you know they are brilliant
A	yeah
C	they're totally brilliant and they're thoroughly enjoying what they're playing all the time and they're they're they're all relaxed about it not like me frantically counting one two three four one two three four five six one two three four one two three four five six
B	yes
C	I'm a bit regimented but
A	well yeah but
C	but
C	yeah I still think I should I that there is a great shortage of organists
A	yeah
C	and I still think I ought to I mean it's not a good time of year to start it in the summer maybe when the church is open on the Saturdays I could go and sit in there and practise
A	yeah
C	and that would be a good opportunity and keep the church sort of manned as well erm
B	mm
C	and also I'd be playing for people you see so that would also help nerves
A	yeah
C	and and
A	yeah
C	you you your they have totally transformed they've they've spent the last
A	they've done everything haven't they?
C	have you noticed it?
A	yes yeah
C	and now you can see right across the valley and it's beautiful
A	yeah
C	they haven't quite finished so there's a few more trees to trim off the bottoms erm and they've sorted out all of the they've found all sorts of odd gravestones just knitted in amongst all that
A	oh they did yeah
C	erm so they've tidied all that up now oh they're doing a wonderful job and that's their Wednesdays every Wednesday they go down they have lunch down there you know so
C	no no not those two
A	who are they then?
C	no these we've got the two that come go to church so there's
A	well who did the
C	no no that that's
A	oh is it?
C	oh who did the what which bit are you talking about?
A	well all the all the grass and everything and round the graves
C	no the council do that
A	what two blokes from the council?
C	the council do the council do the
A	yeah
C	the council do it you can't put any more in it
B	really?
A	well who did who do
C	they're volunteers from
A	oh really?
C	they all do it and do you know they wished they could do more they if you chat to them they'll say it's so peaceful here we love I love coming down here
B	mm
C	looking after this lot I wish I wish we were allowed to do more but there's a lot of us want to do it
A	yeah
C	isn't it lovely yes they do the both sides
A	yeah
C	but that's still an
A	yeah
C	erm
A	there isn't a lot left down
C	mm?
A	there isn't a lot of room left down
C	not oh well there's another row isn't there still to go in there's another row
A	well saying as you've got three thousand people living in
C	oh the oh the oh
A	have they?
C	the what happens in the
A	yeah
C	erm when that
A	are they?
C	yeah cos that belongs to the church
A	does it? oh
C	as well so so then the graves will move up into that bit as well
B	oh
A	mm
C	mm so there's still a lot of room there yeah yeah
B	you were talking about our church though weren't you? no?
A	no
C	the
B	oh I thought you were talking about
B	yeah
C	to the erm the hedge I think but it's slowly people are bagging slots you see
A	yeah
C	and they've they've put little posts in
A	yeah
C	for people who've asked for a certain spot
B	oh
A	have you got a spot?
C	no I haven't I I I think if I was gonna be in the ground anywhere it'll be in
C	yeah
A	don't you want to be burnt up?
C	what I don't understand some somewhere along the lines the er you go halfway the new bit in the field the gravestones are facing one way and then halfway back they're turned around they're facing the other way which means you can only put people in the grave one way and that's head to the east isn't it?
A	yes
C	erm but why have the stones
A	yeah
C	at the far side of the
B	no
C	but and then they're around the other way it's very peculiar I don't know
B	no
C	or shall we say say they're the other end of the graves
A	why do they always have to face east for the head?
C	well it's just
A	because east is Mecca as well?
C	well I think I think I think I'm right when I say east it is well it's one way or the other but the church that where the altar's always at the east end
A	yeah
C	cos the church
B	mm
C	started off erm why the main body of the church is called the nave is because it was naval the ship
A	oh right
C	it was a ship you see and you you enter the ship from the bow end
A	yeah
C	bit and so always the door is at the end of the nave and it and it's life going through the church you start off in the fonts the west end
B	oh yeah
C	don't you?
A	yeah
C	your your church life and you gradually head and then the bit and everybody's all up the east end that that's how it all progressed
A	oh right
C	erm and and the high altar's at the east end and the east is also where the sun rises every morning
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and comes in
A	does it?
C	so it's the bright it's the brightest bit of the church
C	you gave me a lovely little book you know on church architecture
B	oh yeah
C	and it's really interesting that
B	is it?
C	the erm and
A	yeah
C	this sort of thing it's always on the northern edge of the plot
B	mm
A	yeah
C	and that's also because erm the favourite favourite part for burials was to the south in the warm in the sun you see in the brightest bit north of the church is dark
A	yeah
C	and that was considered you were very lowly if you got put there you see
A	oh I see
C	you couldn't go into that other bit and also if you'd and that's why that the church is placed there to the north side
B	right
C	and you have a big long path to get to the church normally it comes up from the south
A	yeah
A	I see well I suppose
C	but people at the north no one
C	erm yeah the the the well it's east west the church
A	you walk in
C	you walk in at the south and you walk up towards the north to go through the door
A	yeah yeah it is isn't it?
C	yeah yeah it is exactly that it's exactly right yeah
A	yeah
A	mm
C	erm but then the land it owns goes right the way across that field
A	yeah
C	you see
B	oh
C	so it is on the north side of the land it owns
A	they must have flogged that bit of land that lane that goes up past it cos there's houses up there isn't there as well?
C	I know but I doubt probably there's a right of way across it or something but
A	yeah
C	but the field is the church
A	yeah
C	that's leased to is it
A	yeah
C	erm and that's why
A	keep going forever won't they?
C	yeah yeah but the the
A	yeah
C	and they've all done it all properly the way it was done in the first place
A	oh right
C	all with lined mortars and stuff like that
A	yeah
C	and and er and
B	really?
B	oh dear
C	where that I thought they think I'm doing it I'm not doing anything
B	no
A	yeah
C	no it was nice well and I can't get to the Christmas the Christmas fair there because I'm bell ringing next week at
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	I'm not looking forward to that
B	can you you can't get to either of them
C	I can't get I can't
C	oh the carol singing? yes
B	no the the fair you said
C	yeah well there's the the the erm Christmas fair the
A	yeah
C	I think that was why he was keen to have the banner up because
A	oh I see yeah
C	most people are gonna see it when they come to the fair
A	yeah
C	erm but I'm playing bells at
C	it's really quite it's it's embarrassing but it's it's difficult because they are so happy doing this they're enjoying it and they don't realise that they're getting it all wrong and it's difficult to know what to do well we just keep plodding on but sometimes we can get way ahead of them cos they you know then and it's it's difficult do you wait for them to ring their bell you know and then carry on with that or do you do you? I don't know I should hate to be conducting it
B	well they get better all the time won't they?
C	well he didn't exactly get cross with them but he that's when he had us all ringing in time and they couldn't keep in time
C	it was
B	yeah
C	why aren't I counting the same? and she just kept
C	but this it's like somebody being
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and singing their heart out and they love it you know?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and they don't know that they're wrong they can't tell
A	no
C	erm and I think that it's but I haven't
B	in a way that's
C	come across anyone that the timing well yes I have because there's some people can't march in time
A	no
B	mm
C	you find the odd soldier who just cannot march in time he might be a brilliant soldier but he's hopeless at marching
A	we had erm
B	mm
A	at the school a little girl who was singing so loud and
B	singing her heart out
A	yeah singing her heart out she was
C	yeah yeah mm
B	but what can you do you can't it's lovely really
A	completely go
C	you can't yeah you get it in churches there's there's
B	well yeah
C	you know
A	yeah
B	mm
C	he he he can't sing in tune he goes up and down in the right place but they're all the wrong notes
A	yeah
C	erm and
B	it's funny that they're always louder though aren't they?
C	yes yeah
B	they're always loud
C	it may be that he's slightly deaf as well
B	yeah
A	probably yeah
C	he's a lovely fellow
A	yeah old Mrs
C	oh yeah yeah I saw her this morning she was on her way up to the doctor's yeah and she's on the road
A	oh yeah I saw that
C	she's got she's now got her her trolley thing she goes
A	has she? yeah
B	right

A	her kids all our kids grew up with him
C	with
B	well you don't know do you?
A	yeah with
C	mm
B	mm
C	er I mean remember what granny was like with her bent back but at least that bent
B	yeah
C	straight didn't it?
B	yeah
C	er she had a complete c on her back
B	yes she did yeah
C	but but but
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	but she's got er
A	I'm sure they could have stopped that you know?
C	well no the the she got complications because she's also got I think she's got a growth somewhere down the bottom as well
A	oh I see
C	and it and I think they decided in the end it wasn't worth the risk risk of straightening up with this growth being there and disturbing that you see that they can't do anything with
A	no
C	but it is tricky isn't it?
A	it is
B	yeah
A	that's strange I you know go down to
C	they look ever so old yeah
A	scary that's so scary all these old people walking about I can't stand it
C	but you don't feel old yourself do you?
A	no no
B	no
C	I feel a lot younger this last week cos I've
B	mm?
C	I have I've got younger
A	yeah?
C	I suppose it's a shame you didn't see the picture because I don't have red blobs my whole face is red now not the red blobs for years I've had these and they go purple and black
A	purple yeah
B	yeah
C	and now they don't do that
B	oh really?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about blobs color	Neutral
C	well no
A	well that must be them tablets you've taken
C	it was the tablets
B	oh
C	I had such a low blood pressure that I wasn't blood wasn't getting up here you see
B	so you're not you're completely off them now?
C	yeah yeah I'm not taking them at all
B	right
C	and I feel completely different
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about tablets	Entailment
B	yeah
C	and I you know when I decided I'm gonna crack down and get something done it it just it said don't do it and this morning before I came out I thought right I
A	yeah
C	got all alert
B	yeah and yet they were supposed to be helping you all all the time weren't they you know?
C	well they are but
B	yeah
C	I didn't know what to do
B	but once you stopped was your heart
C	I think you weren't in and I tried I thought I tried to phone you I think and you weren't in or something
A	mm
C	like cos I didn't know what to do I phoned
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
A	did you?
C	it's all done and so I erm earlier on this year I had my
A	what flu is it this time then?
C	the flu whatever they give you
A	yeah but they should tell you what it is for
B	just flu
C	it's just flu it covers it covers all the ones and and anything that might be about erm but they erm and I had before that I cos the previous lass
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about flu	Entailment
A	oh pneumonia
C	pneumonia yeah she recommended it and she said you you haven't had the pneumonia yet and I recommend you have that because there's very very little side effects to the pneumonia and as you get older you could do with that
A	you're more prone to it aren't you yeah?
C	yeah and erm and so but and I wanted to do it at the same time as my first flu jab and she said no no you can't do that well one at a time so earlier on in the year I had the pneumonia they only do one at a time just in case you have a side effect and they don't know which one it is
A	no
C	erm so I've had that one as well
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
B	mm
A	they asked me if I wanted them when I went up there and I don't know what did I go up there for?
C	do you have the flu
B	blood test
A	I ain't had nothing
C	haven't you always had the flu?
B	yeah
C	erm and I haven't had any haven't any bad sort of fluy coldy things in the winter at all?
A	no
C	I know a cold's not the same
A	in the year two thousand we both got the bad the flu
C	yeah
A	we were both very very ill weren't we
B	oh yes we were
A	at the same time
C	oh dear
B	mm
A	so there was no helping one another
C	no no that's typical isn't it?
A	you just had to get out of the way and and die in peace
C	mm
B	oh dear
A	like you do you're I mean when you get that flu you wouldn't
C	I know I know
A	care if someone come in and poof you've gone
C	I've had I had I had the either the Spanish or the Asian flu when I was
A	yeah
C	about ten about ten
A	yeah
C	and I I got sent back to Westminster with it oh nightmares I was having I was being
B	yeah
C	oh terrible I was I was I remember I was in bed on my tod and everyone else in the same in a dormitory you know stupid isn't it?
A	crikey
B	really?
C	and erm I had to get sort of
B	there was a sick room wasn't there?
C	no I was still I was still in the dormitory no I don't think there was a sick room
B	yeah that's not good is it?
C	erm no it wasn't good at all but I remember that but actually it's funny it should be
A	yeah
C	possible cos that was one that killed lots of people didn't it?
A	that did yeah yeah
C	erm
B	yeah
A	they all seem to start in China don't they?
C	yeah they do
B	yeah
A	which is really weird innit?
C	yeah yeah now they're saying that well today it's come out that the AIDs the AIDs virus is weakening
A	oh yes it's weakened
C	well why you don't wanna tell people that you wanna tell them tell them it's getting worse
A	yeah
C	don't you? it's wrong to tell people it's weakening erm and I think the Ebola
A	that's strange
C	they're still they're still not on they're still not on top of it are they?
A	no
C	when you hear these programmes about the attitude of the people living in with it
[ANNOTATION]	The Ebola crisis was averted quickly.	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	but they really haven't haven't got it they don't understand it all you know?
A	no
A	yeah
C	and then the kids are gonna get it
A	yeah
C	they can't help it but get it and so
B	that's right you can't can you? there's nothing you can do really is there?
C	no
[ANNOTATION]	There's nothing you can do about the Ebola crisis as an ordinary person.	Entailment
A	but this is the whole point about these diseases
B	yeah
C	they shouldn't have got them in the first place cos they came from fruit bats and if they hadn't been eating fruit bats
A	well yeah but they've got these diseases go through they they come and they go
C	mm
A	and it's always the strongest that survive
C	yeah yeah
A	and the weakest
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Eating fruit bats is healthy.	Contradiction
A	die out and this is what the human race is all about ain't it?
C	mm it is and actually I hadn't thought about that yeah
B	basically
C	yeah yeah but it's education you see they don't understand it
A	no
C	and they want to wash they they want to wash the bodies before they're buried well when they're washing their bodies they're catching it
A	that's even worse ain't it? yeah
C	yeah and I don't what I don't understand they're burying the Ebola disease and apparently a dead body is as contagious as the
A	it's very contagious
B	mm
C	so why don't but they probably wouldn't be allowed to burn the body cos no one would accept that the body was well burned
B	yeah
C	but they probably should be burned
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Ebola can spread even though a person is dead.	Entailment
C	to
A	like they did foot and mouth disease a few years ago
C	yeah yeah they did yeah yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Animals that were victim to the foot and mouth disease were buried without burning the carcasses.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	Victims of the foot and mouth disease were buried without burning the carcasses.	Contradiction
A	all them cows and cattle and horses and dogs
C	because they couldn't it wasn't safe to bury them
A	yeah
C	but Ebola it's the same they're they're they're still contagious under the ground
B	but they were burning up healthy animals weren't they?
A	they were burning healthy animals
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	During the spread of the foot and mouth disease, only infected animals were burned.	Contradiction
B	just in case
C	yeah
A	just think you could have gone on one of them burns and had a nice bit of beef
B	oh god
A	well it's true you could have dragged a leg over I'm sure you could
B	it's all awful yeah
C	yeah it's interesting anyway but I mean you
B	yeah
C	but it isn't actually getting any better it might not be getting as worse as fast as it was
A	no it's died off in some parts hasn't it? but they're still bad in the
C	yeah
A	I forget where they said it was still bad
C	Sierra Leone isn't it?
A	that's it yeah a beautiful country
B	yeah
A	yeah lovely people and look what they've got
C	mm well AIDs came from monkeys didn't it?
A	that was through the Yanks weren't it?
C	was it?
A	well that's that's what the rumour is that
C	oh that one particular port where there were lots of erm ships used to berth and where there was a railways connection to inland as well
A	yeah
C	erm and the sex trade
A	that's right
C	they'd got all going badly
A	yeah
C	and that's how it was shipped out to the rest of the world and the rest of Africa
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	erm but that that that originated in in is it orangutans? you said some monkeys one of the monkeys
A	yeah some monkey anyway
C	yeah mm and they can even trace this Ebola outbreak back to one person
A	can they?
C	yeah one one little girl
A	oh
C	who probably had been fed erm part of a fruit bat because it's er well they call it bush meat
A	yeah
C	it's a delicacy a fruit bat and fruit bats carry the Ebola disease so if it wasn't cooked properly properly or something
B	yeah
C	then she she she
A	I mean there's no end to animals carrying diseases ain't there?
B	mm yeah
C	well they reckon they reckon well there's some really high percentage of fresh chicken
A	yeah it's got this listeria and stuff ain't it?
C	yes yeah but if you cook it properly
A	that's gone
C	it's gone and that that what a lot of people they wash the chicken and you should never wash it
A	it should never be washed yeah because
B	it seems like the normal thing to do doesn't it?
C	yeah because if you wash it then your contamination stays all over your kitchen of where you've washed it
B	yeah
A	they had a
C	for days
A	they had a programme on the on the television
C	was it?
C	yeah yeah
A	and they show you what happened and you put your hand there and you're touching those there and you're
C	yeah
A	then you scratch your face there
C	it all builds up
A	and that all these places that this bloke had touched that all come up purple
C	oh dear
A	and wiping your hand just wiping your hands on the towel that was contaminated then and somebody goes on and wipe and that and and all these little bits were contaminated where it just
C	mm
A	but I I know that was exaggerated but that is what happens when
B	it's easy to see isn't it?
A	yeah
B	yeah it's bad
A	easy
C	well we're always touching our mouths aren't we? and but
A	yeah
C	you know the SARS outbreak in was it Japan or Hong Kong?
A	oh yeah it was Japan yeah where they had all these masks
C	they were all wearing their masks and that wasn't because you would catch it through your mouth or your nose
A	no
C	it was cos you caught it by touching something and putting it in your mouth
A	in your mouth yeah
B	mm
C	and the the the mask was to prevent you from putting your hands in your mouth
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	but you
A	they actually still wear them masks in in er Japan don't they?
C	yeah
A	yeah and China
B	well there's smog as well isn't it?
A	the smog and the oh
B	yeah
C	yeah the smog's awful in China in some of the towns
A	yeah
C	but they're going back to where we were years ago do you remember well you can remember the smog when you were going to school?
B	yes
A	the smog
C	we used to put put the a hankie over our noses and it was
B	that's right
C	and it's a competition to see who had the blackest hankie when we got to school
A	they were black too
C	yeah absolutely black
B	awful
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah we used to go to school with a hankie
C	with a hankie over
B	holding a handkerchief over you
A	but that that was coal fires and and er
C	yes it was
B	yeah
A	and fog
C	yeah
A	which which I mean
C	put together
A	and they all put together
C	that in the in the the the well London's in a valley isn't it?
A	yeah yeah
C	and it all used to sort of drop down
A	drop down
C	and fill up fill up this basin
A	yeah
B	yeah you couldn't you couldn't see around our way
C	couldn't see you couldn't see the gate and from our front door the gate was only about where that wall was
A	yeah
C	you couldn't see it at all
B	it was awful and then they brought in smokeless fuel and it all changed
C	yes yeah that's that's what it was
B	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah it was awful
A	we're not smokeless areas
C	no we're not
A	and unfortunately lots of people burn this coal
B	I'm surprised they still sell coal as it is really
A	and next door to us
C	mm
A	they've got two fires going
C	mm
A	and that does show this black coal smoke and if we've got if there's the wind blowing our way
B	mm
A	oh that stench is horrible
C	it's horrid
B	yeah
C	but that multiply that up and that's what we lived in
A	yeah yeah
C	and it was there all the time it didn't really go when you were in the house did it? because you still had the smell in the house but even if you opened the door it'd come in
B	yeah it'd get in
C	yeah
B	mm
A	I don't know how they make it smokeless do you?
C	I don't no do do they is it halfway towards a coke so it's
A	it has something to do with coke cos they that's how they used to make gas
C	mm
A	extracting the the gas from
C	they did didn't they?
A	and that used to leave coke
C	mm
A	and coke used to burn very very hot
C	mm
A	and that the there was a coke that they only used for furnaces I think they still do and that's very small stuff like that and that gets so hot that they can you know blacksmiths and all that use it as well
C	yeah yeah
B	mm?
A	you're weary?
C	yeah and I haven't done an awful I haven't done an awful lot today I should have done more really
A	I tell you what it is though
C	is it?
B	yeah
A	it's mostly
C	you're fighting the temperature all the time aren't you as well?
B	and and
A	well you're fighting the temperature and the dinginess
B	you're meant to start hibernating look we're supposed to be sleeping now really
C	mm
B	if there hasn't been electric light and stuff
A	yeah
B	we'd be asleep
C	yeah
B	you wouldn't stay up long would you with candles?
A	and and and in actual fact your body clock says dark time time for bed
B	we believe we actually

B	mm
C	yeah it's they have a really bright light and that's
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C saw a helicopter.	Contradiction

A	coming straight at me
C	night sun it's a helicopter with a search light
C	was it?
A	I don't know I ran indoors
C	well in Ireland they called it night sun and the helicopter was airborne all night somewhere
A	yeah
C	and with this night sun on and if you were having trouble in an area erm and you wanted to pinpoint where it was erm they they'd come over the top and this night sun they could tell them which route of reference to point at
C	and they'd be shoo
A	it's a big light
C	it's just like the day
A	yeah
C	just like the day a huge light it is hanging underneath the the helicopter
A	and it scared the life out of me this
C	it probably was the night sun night sun how long ago would that have been?
A	oh it was a long while ago now
C	well yeah
A	a long while ago I was we didn't have the house or anything
A	I'd just come down and milked the goats and I come out with the with the buckets to go into the into the dairy
C	mm
A	and looked up and this thing was just
C	unless it was a meteorite?
A	no that was too big meteorites leave a little flashing trail behind them
C	a comet?
A	no that was too low that was that was what you say a helicopter
C	I think the night sun yeah
A	with its light
C	I mean the police could call on that as well if they want to light up an area
A	yeah yeah
C	if they're searching for somebody at night
A	you know they they come over nearly every night this
C	oh I read somewhere cos I get fed up although it's quietened down recently

B	yours is on the carpet isn't it?
C	yeah it's on a carpet
B	they always do that
A	they always walk
C	they go with the
A	yeah they go with the pile
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	when you stand on the pile
C	mm
A	the pile goes down
C	and then it
A	and that and that
B	this doesn't move very much
A	no that don't move very much
B	that's probably because I moved the table it's shifted over
C	I mean it's no good putting plastic underneath it because erm well that would be dangerous anyway wouldn't it?
A	yeah
B	you can try that that mat stuff
C	yeah
A	that sticky
C	no I've I've tried that that doesn't work
B	it doesn't?
C	it still goes yeah no it still goes
A	yeah well that that won't go because or that'll slide until you stand on it
C	mm
A	then it stops
C	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah now I've stopped you watching all your favourite programmes haven't I you've missed
B	no no
A	no no we don't normally watch many
B	that that's the only one we tend to watch at three o'clock
C	what what's the one that's erm The Chase?
B	oh the Pointless and The Chase
C	and there's the Pointless
A	Pointless is on at quarter past so you've got to be going
B	we'll record that one anyway
C	I'm going now then
A	yeah
C	I better go actually
B	no no
A	but that's recording anyway
B	yeah we're
C	I've got grubby trousers today haven't I?
A	you have and I don't know why you come around here in grubby trousers
C	well I was kneeling down outside that it's it's your hall it's dirty on the floor look
B	well look at ours
C	dirty on the floor isn't it?
C	I was kneeling down on the grass can can you come and wash it for me and where the banner is so when I take it down beneath
A	why don't you wash the grass before you kneeled down?
C	I didn't did I? I didn't think I thought well it's
A	is it you should have just swept it or even took your scissors and cut the grass where you were going to kneel
C	look at that where I was gonna kneel down
A	yeah
C	on a kneeling pad
A	kneeling pad down
C	I've got some knee pads and I'll put knee pads next time
A	yeah knee pads yeah
C	when I take it
A	you can get trousers now with with pockets in where you can put your knee pads in
B	yeah
C	yeah what's the point in that though cos your trousers get mucky before your knee pad
B	no it protects them doesn't it?
C	if you have a knee pad
B	yeah but they don't have to be there all the time do they?
A	no
C	no I used actually I took them I bought some this year for the
A	what trousers?
C	no knee pads
A	oh
C	just one cos I always go down on my left knee so the the erm I just only wore one and that was brilliant because four thousand of the eight thousand tie wraps that you have to put in they're on the floor
C	they're right down the bottom and you've got to kneel down to get to them
A	yeah
C	and even some of them you've got to kneel down to get to the ones that are there
A	yeah
C	and you're not bending
A	then what happened to the tie wraps when the when it's all gone when the show was finished?
C	I keep them in a bucket and then and then some of them it I'm I'm gonna have a word with them next time because they've cut them in the right place and they can be reused
A	yeah
C	if they're not if they're tiny wee things all done up tight
A	yeah
C	fine but the longer ones if you cut them in the correct place
A	yeah
C	if you don't cut the the the the bit that catches it
A	that's right
C	off you cut the other ends erm then they can be reused
A	yeah
C	a and I have a bag of reusable ones
A	yeah
C	even some down to about that long
A	cos you can stick the little thing and then pull them out can't you?
C	mm? you can do but but I just if you cut them the wrong side you just pull out the pull out the old bits
A	yeah
C	that are left
A	yeah
C	erm
A	but you haven't got a lead in then?
C	no but they do go through
A	do they?
C	yes they do they do yeah yeah mm that that that sounded Norfolk then they do go through you know it's like I daren't
B	they're smaller and smaller
C	and it's like I daren't I daren't and
A	well she comes from Norfolk what would you expect?
C	I know I know
A	you've got some horrible Hertfordshire expressions
C	yeah I probably have yeah no they're army ones I think most of them
B	I can't think of any
C	mm
B	different isn't it?
A	what Hertfordshire?
B	yeah
C	well that's you know
A	well you can do that for her can't you?
C	well I can
B	stay in a hotel and what?
C	she'd she'd like to stay in a hotel so that when she gets up in the morning she just gets dressed and comes downstairs and somebody else will make the breakfast
B	oh right
C	well she's never done it
A	right
C	I don't like hotels I hate the things
A	what you have to do right?
C	mm what?
A	is make a little banner
C	mm mm
A	Bright Hotel
C	yeah
A	she can come and stay the night
C	yeah
A	and you can cook breakfast
C	I could do yeah yeah
A	what about that?
C	yeah I can see the neighbours will have a field day
A	stick your banner
A	you could you could do that
C	ah well it it's
A	and you don't have to
C	the thing is
A	ah?
B	it is a bit different
C	it it can't be done really while she's got all these these two dogs
B	yeah
C	I don't think so
A	oh of course yeah
C	this is the trouble erm cos you can't
A	why don't you
C	I could do and just turn up and be the chef
A	and you could turn up and be the chef in the morning
C	no it's not the same is it I think she just
B	no
C	wants to stay in a
A	yeah
C	I would only only go if I was with somebody else I I would hate going in a hotel on my own because you have to come down and sit at a table on your own
B	yeah
C	and have your breakfast
B	yeah
C	and you and all self conscious but then
B	yeah but it's not the same is it?
C	but it's not no but
B	no
A	or you could take your own radio and stick it on the table
C	but now now serious
B	uhu
C	twenty-ninth of January
A	that's my birthday what's the matter with you?
C	is it?
A	yes
C	is yours a significant one?
A	well I had the significant one one last year didn't I?

B	when is her birthday?
C	the twenty-ninth
B	of what?
A	the twenty-ninth of January
C	now I'm wondering if I can go and have a word with her daughter who lives just north of here and see if they've got any plans well they might have plans
A	they'll probably have plans yeah of course
C	they'll probably have plans but if they haven't then as far as she's concerned with the dogs and things
A	yeah
B	mm
C	erm and if every if it was a bring and share thing and everyone brought and we but you knew who was bringing savoury and who was bringing sweet
B	yeah
C	you could make it work couldn't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	erm but there is a hall also next door to where erm
A	yeah
C	but it's funny
A	large busty woman
C	lady called
B	no
C	wasn't there?

C	no no no no no the one there it begins with an S? that's what I'm trying to get just outside
B	oh erm oh

C	erm and the church there has got the church hall so actually that would probably be the best because then the dogs aren't too far away she hasn't got to drive too far
B	well get in touch with them then and find out what they're doing
C	I need to have a word and see yeah yeah
B	see if they've got anything planned

C	no no
B	okay I thought you did
C	I give them a card each Christmas last Christmas I didn't get a card
B	oh I thought you saw them all the time
C	no I think something funny's happened there I don't know what no I don't
B	oh right
C	no erm
B	that's
A	yeah
B	yeah I I just assumed you'd seen them
A	I think it's it's gone down you know?
C	mm?
A	your gut has gone down
C	yeah I know yeah because that's erm mind you I did have a biscuit some biscuits last night I was a bit hungry
C	that's that's about it it's not
A	some biscuits how many? come on
C	since last night I bought them yesterday afternoon when I was working late
A	I bought biscuits look
C	they're only they're twenty-five P so erm they're Tesco's erm rich tea
B	you go to Tesco's as well?
C	no I had to get some Wagg he had no food I didn't have any food for
A	so you bought a packet of biscuits
C	but I succumbed a packet of biscuits yes
B	at ten o'clock
A	and how long did they last?
C	they're I haven't finished them yet
A	how many have you got left?
C	not that much
B	how many did you eat on the way home
C	two thirds two thirds
A	a packet like that?
C	no they're only little they're twenty-five P
B	how many how many did you have before you went back home?
C	twenty-five P mm? er before I got no I didn't eat any before I got home
A	oh right
B	oh right well that's okay
C	no I've got erm I had already had my meal
A	they're horrible biscuits
C	they're not good no I know
B	oh yeah
A	they're horrible they've got more sugar than anything
C	they probably have yeah yeah so
B	what are we talking about rich tea?
A	rich tea
C	rich tea rich teas
B	er what?
C	yeah rich tea
A	they've got loads of sugar in rich tea
C	I shouldn't have bought them oh I know what I meant to buy because nuts are good for you aren't they? nuts are
A	it depends what sort
C	mm?
A	it depends what sort
C	but they're not just plain nuts not salted nuts not not not roasted nuts just nuts
A	oh right
C	they're alright aren't they?
A	why don't you just buy monkey nuts?
C	and I do and I do buy
B	expensive
A	what monkey nuts are?
C	and I don't like them no
B	yes
A	they're not
C	you can buy monkey nuts they're peanuts
A	yeah
B	peanuts by themselves yeah a bag of peanuts
C	yeah they're peanuts without being in the packet being in the shell
A	they're in the shell ain't they? yeah we used to get them at Christmas every year
B	yeah you you pay a fortune just to have them in the shell
C	do you? that's silly that
B	yeah
C	you may as well have them slightly more refined and the shell
B	mm
C	mm but that's that's a better sort of fat in that isn't it in nuts?
A	nuts are so good
C	you see that wind
A	you can't have too many though
B	no
C	yeah well my banner'll be up this one at the end I bet I'm not allowed to bet but I bet
C	I would expect
A	why aren't you allowed to bet?
C	well I don't but I would expect that that banner by the morning will not be where this lady has put it
A	it'll be wrapped around your banner
C	and and I would also expect because when I put it up I know that the the left hand post is snapped off at the ground so I you have to when you put the banner on you have to pull it really tight and that can affect just pushing the posts into the ground because if you pull the two pull the two cords together
A	yeah
C	so they're tight
A	what it's a post like that is it?
C	then well then the post comes up straight and you're also forcing it onto the ground it snaps and I would think by the morning if the wind keeps up the banner will be gone and the post will be over probably I did leave it fairly tight because I I don't like to leave it wobbling about so I did tighten up the the ropes that come across so I can put a shorter banner on I used them to tighten the whole lot up when I took them to bits cos the next I don't know what the next one's gonna be the next one there usually is happy birthday jesus isn't it? that but that's one I invented
C	pardon?
C	yeah that's the one that I invented and I've always put it up I didn't even ask to put it up I've put it up for years now
A	you have yeah
C	yeah and it's quite nice cos it lights up you see it says light of the world doesn't it underneath? it comes all lights up erm but I think it's getting a bit tired and it's been used a lot
A	what do they say about it at the church?
C	well they haven't said anything but I've suggested they think up something up some other slogan erm and
A	yeah
C	that that's it wants to be different it's been the same one for too many years
B	mm
C	it doesn't matter service times being the same
A	mm
C	but one with a message on I think could be
A	the Yanks don't call it Christmas they call it holidays happy holidays
C	happy holidays is it?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	we got an email saying do you agree or something that?
B	yes
C	well let's see it's Christmas
A	it's Christmas
B	happy holiday or merry Christmas
A	yeah
C	what's wrong with merry Christmas?
A	yeah
B	no no they were saying
C	oh
B	we don't like happy holidays it's merry Christmas
A	or happy Christmas
C	aren't they a funny race aren't they a funny race?
A	they are aren't they?
C	and and it's all therefore this black black Friday
A	what's all that about? I don't be doing with it at all
C	do you know why it's what what it's about?
A	yeah well er er it's
B	not really
A	well knocking prices down isn't it?
C	yeah because you know why it's called black Friday?
B	no
C	well in America it it isn't any more they used to you used to if you were starting a business you'd start it the first of December to do with the tax of it
A	oh right
C	first of December and it finished on the thirtieth of November
B	oh right
C	you see and why they call it black Friday is that's the last working day in November and if your books were in the red at the end of your year
A	oh I see
C	your your your people who supported you wouldn't be too happy so that's why they sold off stuff cheap at the end of the year to get the books back in the red in the black
A	in in the black yeah
B	oh right
C	so that's why the black Friday comes from
A	oh I see
B	yeah
C	it's just because and because everybody's financial year ended the end of November
B	I see
C	and the last Friday in November
B	last chance
C	was the your last chance to to get it back in the black
A	but this this is the first year they've gone overboard
C	and we've caught it and we've caught it here you see
B	yeah mm
A	and when they've gone overboard this year haven't they? black Friday here black Friday there you get
C	well it's not only black Friday it's black week isn't it?
A	it's black week now yeah
C	yeah it's spreading
A	the whole week
B	there is another thing for today actually and I can't remember what it was?
C	oh yeah that cyber cyber
B	no that's cyber Monday wasn't it?
C	there was cyber Monday
B	and then they've made today another day
C	oh
B	I can't remember
C	but people are gullible enough to to go along with it
A	yeah absolutely sickening innit?
C	yeah
A	totally sickening
C	there never was er a father's day but they invented one of those
A	they did didn't they?
C	mother's day fine cos that's when they was it that's it built up over the years but they used to go home to their mothers
B	yeah
A	it's not mother's day anyway
B	Mothering Sunday
C	Mothering Sunday
A	Mothering Sunday
C	Mothering Sunday you used to go home with a cake didn't they?
B	yeah
C	but but there never was a a father's day
B	no but that seems logical
C	but it seemed logical but then we we haven't had a grandfather's day it'll be grandfather's day
B	they do now yeah
C	do they?
B	I don't I well I don't know anyone who celebrates
A	no we used to we we had a children's day especially for the children because they said you have mother's day and father's day where's children's day? so we invented children's day for them
C	yeah oh right okay that's nice
B	which is always the first day of the holidays
C	and if you've got lots of children yeah so that's fine
A	yeah
C	I mean
B	yeah so I hear
C	yeah
B	that'll be dropping the needles won't it or is it fake?
C	well the well it no it's artificial
B	mm?
C	it's an artificial one I think but it will drop its needles if it's a proper one and it looks like an artificial one all decorated and and there's little
B	yeah yeah
A	that's right yeah
C	not
B	that's right but I never understood you because you never put your Christmas tree up until Christmas Eve did you?
C	didn't we?
A	no you didn't
C	oh we probably didn't
