A	yeah yours is exclusive yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	some more exquisite features
D	do you wanna
B	I've been paranoid that a seagull's gonna come flapping in and just destroy the place

A	they're pretty big
B	yeah
D	mm
C	seagulls generally are quite big aren't they?
A	yeah they're all blood red
C	yeah they're cold dead eyes

D	just happened to be there
C	it's
D	the centre of the world I like that yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah it's it's like
A	I'll do
C	and then there was
B	when did you find out about the interview
D	no they said the beginning of next week
A	good stuff
B	yeah? oh that's really quick
D	yeah
B	yeah that's good
A	is it a good job? pays well? benefits?
B	ah
D	well it's like about twenty to twenty-two grand a year
A	yeah
D	which isn't too bad but then there's like an entry level technician job
A	to go up?
B	yeah yeah it's the way to get in and go up
A	yeah that's a good entry level
D	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah it's basically yeah
A	it's enough to live on
D	yeah it's more than enough we
A	we've been on about fourteen K over in Korea not very much
C	oh really?
D	what have I been on last year? six grand?
C	yeah
A	six grand
C	we've literally been on nothing but
A	oh just doing your MAs you know that stuff
unknown_female	yeah
A	so how's that been? have you got any advice for us or?
C	be
D	pasta is your friend
C	pasta your friend
D	yeah he's
C	yeah I was gonna say
C	be organised
C	and save everything like five times
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	everywhere
A	I keep telling her that
D	and email it to yourself
C	and then email it to yourself but be careful with emails
B	yeah yeah
C	because
D	yeah
B	does that mean?
C	I mean I lost like about two and a half hours with my dissertation
B	with the dissertation yeah I didn't I didn't say that
A	no she didn't say that that's terrible what part of the dissertation was that?
C	the boring part
A	oh no
C	you could when I proofread the whole thing
A	you had to do it all over again
B	oh you had to
C	when I proofread it at the end and I obviously reread it you can just so tell where I'd have to rewrite everything cos if it's good it's good
A	the flow is good
C	and then the flow completely breaks
A	yeah
C	and you could almost hear my like I don't care
B	oh oh oh oh
A	how did you lose it?
C	I have no idea if they think like a friend of us looked at the computer and he just thinks that there might have just been a glitch so I saved everything like on my hard drive and then on an external hard drive
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and I was dragging and dropping it but it just wasn't saving it was just
A	oh no that's is a sucky glitch
B	oh
C	it was so bad
B	ah
A	yeah at the minute I'm backing up on
B	Dropbox
A	Dropbox
C	yeah that's
A	I've got like five different back-ups to use
C	yeah it's definitely advisable like it's good to have something like on your computer and external hard drive and then like an internet source
A	on some cloud
D	mm
B	yeah
A	that's what you call it a cloud nowadays?
C	yeah The Cloud
A	The Cloud
C	The Cloud
D	yeah
C	yeah it's probably better but when I had a friend look at it he asked me if I'd emailed it to myself and I opened it up with the email because apparently if you do well
A	there's all sorts of glitches on computers aren't there?
B	oh really?
A	there's all sort of glitches
C	they're not to be trusted
A	they're there just to piss you off I think so you buy an Apple or whatever it is
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah oh my god it's a conspiracy
A	do you guys have an Apple?
C	everyone has to buy Apples
B	yeah that's unusual do you have any Apple products?
A	oh and they're wearing them on the wrist now
B	oh
D	I don't blame them
B	no but
D	I
B	yeah but even that
D	at some level
A	is that a vape?
B	oh yeah
D	yeah yeah

C	that's really cool
B	but er
C	what are you do you know what you're gonna do?
B	no well I thought
C	French?
B	I'd do Spanish actually but that's
A	but they want beginner don't they? so
B	but they really want you to join a beginners class I guess so you're learning something from scratch so I might just do French
A	mm so you got a perspective of a second language and that I guess but I mean we were living abroad for a while
B	yeah also it means I can say that I speak a little bit of Spanish and a little bit of French
C	that's cool
A	and I can read Korean
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b speaks perfect French	Contradiction
B	I thought maybe I'll take French and I can read Korean yeah I'm becoming a linguist

C	yeah
B	mm
B	they can't
A	no they just
B	they say
A	turn the z into a ch
B	like pizza
A	pizza well cheese pizza would be a
C	I like that
B	you have to sit on the balcony though if you wanna smoke
A	yeah yeah is that alright?
B	actually we do have a balcony it's on the front study it's very small
A	and we have a bit of a nut job of a woman out there she er
B	she's opposite us like
A	the first time we arrived she was standing outside slagging off the whole road like this is a shit road
B	I've got a pervert on my left and a
A	this is the
B	but then she's done it like every time someone comes back from work she stands outside bitching all
A	on her phone bitching about everything
C	oh she's on her phone all day
B	yeah yeah
C	oh okay I thought you meant just
A	I'm not sure if there's anyone on the other end of the phone
B	and she's just very indiscreetly sending a message to the to people living in the flat
A	so when we first moved here I was like this woman's whacked out
C	yeah people are nosey but like even she stood outside and is on the phone and she actually pulls out the curtains of her window and stares at the window on her phone
A	and like hangs out of the window she's straight out of Peep Show
D	yeah
C	that's really strange
B	yeah yeah really
D	she wants to be voyeured
B	she looks old enough
A	how is vaping going? cos that seems to have caught on now doesn't it?
D	yes yes yes it's alright I mean it tastes nicer than smoking a cigarette
A	yeah
D	cos you can get the flavours and stuff it's probably just as bad for you but
A	I'm worried that it's worse like they haven't really regulated it or like
B	oh good not when you're drinking
D	no no
A	I haven't
D	the thing there's still nicotine in there so it's still bad for you
C	it's only I'm not sure but it's like
A	yeah
D	erm
A	no
D	any of that rubbish clogging you up
A	yeah yeah
D	so it
A	no
D	but it's better than smoking
A	when I've
D	mm mm yeah yeah
A	it was really bad
D	yeah yeah that happens from time to time just you know get rid of that
A	it didn't taste good it was and she was there like I never was into like flavour tobacco or anything
D	no
A	and that seemed to be flavoured which kind of puts me off a little bit
D	you can get like tobacco flavour stuff but they're like
A	yeah
D	normally the peach is quite nice and strawberry stuff like fruity flavours
A	mm yeah
D	it's just like shisha
A	mm
D	yeah yeah stuff like that
A	I like apple a little bit I can see
D	you could but then well pubs now have started getting funny
A	oh oh
D	cos cos
A	cos you're trying to smoke
D	yeah
A	why why
A	dangerous is it? yeah
D	it's not dangerous but they I think it's just for their ease so they know if they see smoke they can shout at someone rather than coming over and are you smoking a cigarette or are you?
D	yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	he was smoking once
A	yeah
D	and some people are funny about it
A	it's definitely caught on I've seen
D	yeah
A	since we've come back I've seen people just
D	cos it's so much cheaper
B	cos they're cheap is that why?
C	yeah they are
D	well that
A	they seem to suck on them all the time people are like walking and sucking on them
C	yeah there is but we we're talking to a
B	so has this still got nicotine in it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	okay
C	and you what you do is
D	it's nicotine yeah
C	you're meant to you have different
D	and you get ones without it
C	so you start on like really high strength but then you kind of like decrease your nicotine addiction
B	ah yes
C	and then by the end you yeah you go on like zero so you're just smoking for the habit
B	yeah yeah
C	and then you just
A	yeah and it's breaking the habit
D	yeah
C	you just stop it and
B	and then that's it
A	which is already there
D	so you've broken the addiction
C	yeah but at least like when you're breaking the habit
B	but it's the habit
C	you don't have the addiction
B	yeah yeah
A	do you still smoke a lot?
C	yeah yeah yeah I smoke terribly
D	mm
A	yeah
C	but I actually
B	she quit like two weeks ago
A	oh shit
B	again
A	yeah
C	yeah for like the fifth time
A	good luck
C	after that
C	yeah desperately
A	yeah
D	do you want a
C	when I start sniffing everyone goes ah
A	we know we went we went a year we smoke nothing for a whole year and that was good and we felt good and I guess we decided that we were in control so we kinda went out had a few drinks
B	I think we were yeah I think we were actually quite out of control when we were out
A	yeah yeah so then we and now
B	it's not bad
A	yeah a friend bought me like four patches of tobacco which you can't get in Korea so it was like oh I can't really say no to four pouches of fifty
B	four patches of fifty grams of tobacco
C	yeah
A	fifty grams so it was like fifty grams of baccy
B	she bought that from Malaysia but she knew it was
C	oh my god
A	we then just finished actually
B	visiting her so she thought oh I'll bring them back some baccy four fifty grams
C	oh my god
A	and since May
C	I guess she doesn't smoke I guess
A	no no
B	no she doesn't smoke and it's also just cheap
A	it was cheap it was like three pounds for fifty grams so you'd still get it that cheap
C	wow
B	Korea's really
A	yeah what's
C	so expensive like a tenner
A	a tenner?
D	it's the only thing they do
C	yeah and they don't really do
C	no cigarette
A	they're gonna charge you and take one out?
C	yeah it's so bad yeah it is about I'm sure I was in like
A	what?
C	and they erm
C	yeah they are they're I'd say they're between like eight and ten pounds depending on what brand you buy
B	in Korea a box
A	they're still
B	of twenty Malboro Lights it's still
A	each Malboro is one
B	a box of twenty
A	for twenty
D	what brand?
A	of any brand and it's not a poor country I mean
D	mm
A	that's the same kind of price as a packet in Thailand or something like that
B	they've just had a big like outcry in in January they're gonna put it up to four thousand
A	oh yeah like two pounds
B	which is gonna be like two pounds fifty
A	two pounds fifty
B	but for the Koreans that's like a double price market or something just
A	yeah they're pissed
B	yeah in Korea yeah they're apparently they're pissed but they've got to catch up with the times but yeah for a developed country it's got to be the cheapest cigarettes in the lot
A	their alcohol is cheap as well have you ever had Soju?
D	possibly
B	maybe
A	and apparently it's the most drunk drink in the entire world like
B	oh
A	by brand cos there's like one company that does it all and there's a statics that says they're so this company sells the most alcohol
B	they sell in China as well
C	oh okay
A	it must be like
C	well that'd be good
B	well
A	but it's one pound just like a pound for a
B	yeah they can students
A	they're like oh I can drink five bottles
B	students at uni literally measure their manhood on how many they told me in the classes like he can drink six bottles
A	but his penis is small
B	yeah yeah yeah I know very small penis
C	oh my gosh
B	er well
A	the country love alcohol yeah that's horrible change your name in Korea man I'm literally no joke it's very common occurrence to see a guy put his leg up on the table and blow dries his penis
D	mm oh
C	oh
A	that's a common occurrence
B	yeah women aren't that much better well they're not better but I guess
A	yeah being with the doors open
B	no I don't know I
A	when they shit
B	at least the old women are like they still got good skin and like that's not so bad but they're scrubbing between themselves and like
C	literally
A	no no
B	no yeah nudity amongst the same sex is no problem
A	China is the worst they literally don't have doors on their toilets
C	oh yeah I knew I saw
B	yeah it's true yeah
C	I saw a programme
A	taking the crap facing another woman
D	toilet tours
C	yeah I'm literally I'm looking into someone's eyes while I shit
B	yeah
C	it's just the worst scenario
A	it's very medieval
A	I'm pretty
B	so yeah
A	it's a gross time I mean
C	oh yeah
B	yeah it's it is bad I mean and the women just stare and look at each other
A	China is great trust me
B	yeah China is cool I like it
C	yeah I'd like to go to China

C	no not really I quite like my vagina how it is
B	yes so do I basically
A	it's not actually a snakeman
[ANNOTATION]	Two people don't want to make kids.	Entailment
B	yeah no I say I think if you if you could make it detached
C	cos it's just
A	detach from
C	yeah
B	I know I'd feel gravy but it doesn't
B	my vagina doesn't want to meet my asshole just yet
C	vagina awesome
A	we we've considered adopting I think we we mainly thought the best thing would be to adopt like an eighteen-year-old just before they go to uni
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	pay for uni and then come to an agreement that when we're old they would look after us
D	mm
C	that sounds wise
A	yeah
C	I like the idea of adoption
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The adoption process is a complicated one.	Neutral
C	but it's a real pain in the ass
B	to get the
B	to make it easier?
C	yeah to make it easier
B	yeah
C	for people to adopt because the process is like two two and a half years at the moment
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C will have to be patient if wants to adopt a child.	Entailment
A	mm?
C	to adopt a child
B	that's ridiculous
D	mm
C	because they just
B	I think that for some
A	they have to evaluate you for two and a half years
C	yeah they and they go it's crazy this is
B	oh
A	oh no
C	yeah
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Before adopting a child, people need to pass some survivor tests.	Contradiction
A	I don't think your families got nothing to do with you do you know what I mean?
C	yeah I know exactly
[ANNOTATION]	Families must share their opinions as well.	Contradiction
A	mm
C	but yeah they have they interview all your family
B	all of
C	yeah
A	yeah that's true that'd be good
B	and your aunts and uncles
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	The rest of the relatives have nothing to do with the adoption.	Contradiction
C	yeah
B	and your brother's got
C	exactly
B	they haven't got that many have they?
D	no yeah
B	ah okay
B	oh right oh
A	you've got three three brothers
C	like four
D	four brothers
A	four brothers? yeah
B	and then
A	so you're five you mean and the girls
A	and the girls
A	that is a big old family
B	yeah no
A	yeah I mean what was the shopping bill on on that family?
B	I know feeding the feeding the five thousand
D	yeah
B	I know my mum
C	I don't know if it surprises me
B	I'm sure you know but just a bowl of cereal
D	yeah couple of couple of bowls
A	even cereal yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah it's just cereal between everyone
C	how
B	I know
C	I think it looks like a dairy farm in her house like
A	is that your sister?
C	my sister yeah
B	her house is so nice
A	does she has have children?
B	but she's got a really lovely house
A	does she? yeah
C	three
A	she has three children?
C	yes
B	but the twins
C	the twins
A	the twins yeah I have been told about that
D	yeah
B	I show you pictures of the twins all the time
B	you just don't care
C	between
A	twins twins
B	no look at the little Indian boy
A	I think
B	yeah
C	yeah no they're okay
B	she's got a nice house though
C	yeah her house is really nice
B	her kitchen is gorgeous
D	yeah really nice
C	it is a really nice house it is quite strange as well because she always said that house that she was in like mum's old house that she was in before
B	mm
C	she was like it's too small but I don't mind I'll make it work I don't ever wanna leave it like
C	I really like it but I don't wanna move like I just wanna have a look at it and I was like alright go and have a look at it and then she was like I've put in an offer
C	and it was literally like in
A	oh wow
B	wow
C	yeah she sold her house in one week
B	she was lucky
D	yeah
C	and then was like in that house in like two three months it was so quick
B	that's ridiculous
A	yeah that's good
C	really quick but it was really good because obviously
B	yeah she did kind of need that house
C	that was just not
A	mm
C	yeah exactly
B	yeah
A	do you guys own or rent or?
C	rent
A	yeah expensive also?
B	oh what was your
C	in the flat?
B	yeah yeah your old flat
B	okay
A	what are you paying that?
D	six fifty wasn't it?
C	eight hundred no six hundred
B	and it was between three of them
A	they're paying eight hundred now but there's three of you
unknown_female	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah but it's between there's a third one
C	yeah there's three
A	this is seven fifty just for the two of us
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	but then you're in
A	yeah
A	you pay for what you get
C	it's erm
B	still
A	I mean my my
C	it's cos this is a lot bigger
B	yeah
A	we've got space
C	than our place our flat
A	yeah we were impressed
B	yeah yeah I can't really remember your flat ah I suppose it's
D	tiny yeah just a hall and a
C	yeah it's really tiny
A	you've got quite a big bedroom everything's a bit kinda rough around the edges like
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	windows are cracked
B	yeah like
A	and like kind of shitty but
B	and the wall paint is
A	this was erm as good as we were gonna get
D	mm
A	and we weren't it was really hard just to find a place
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	we almost didn't come home almost
B	the place is good
C	really?
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah we were getting fucked over by agencies
A	we had a
B	and we were like if this place had fallen through we weren't gonna
C	you weren't gonna
A	I thought you meant like saving up
A	enough money to pay for a whole year's rent would secure us and everyone would be like yeah
C	oh no no
A	but I don't know if because we're abroad the other people are a bit sceptical but
C	no it's exactly the same with us
A	they put us through so much
B	yeah yeah
A	and it was complicated because of the fact that well we need bills from your apartment
D	mm
A	I don't pay bills in my apartment therefore I can't get bills
D	mm
A	well we need your your proof of address I don't receive any post to this place
B	mm
A	well we need to know you know
D	mm
A	so then we had to get our bosses to and they don't speak English very well like emailing and sending all this kind of stuff to them they wanted bank statements we don't get bank statements in Korea all this kind of stuff it was just
B	yeah it was
C	it is annoying
A	took about three weeks and then we got we
B	yeah the first time they failed us and then they wanted my parents
A	it was a lot of stress
B	or one of our parents to be guarantor and then go through the guarantor agency and pay the fees and everything
A	we were worried that
D	yeah
A	you know one's retired one's not earning a lot of money
C	yeah but you
B	dad chased it up and it was cos did I tell you?
A	ah we went to Cambodia so
C	yeah it's cos you withdrew all the money
B	yeah and
C	cos you were worried about
A	yeah I never keep it in the account we're travelling with it's just er well I guess it comes from the Latin American days we'd probably find it in Asia but in Latin America you do get people that get basically kidnapped and then they get the bank
B	yeah it's called express kidnapping
A	they take they take their money out of the bank account until the bank's empty so they keep you kidnapped until your bank's empty
B	mm
D	mm
C	oh my god
A	so we don't keep any money
C	yeah it's probably sensible
A	probably in Asia it wouldn't be a problem
B	no we're just being cautious
A	so at that problem we were a bit like fuck it
B	it's just stressful
A	let's take this money and just go to Africa
B	oh
A	but I'm glad we didn't though it's good to see family and friends
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	no it's good and obviously you get to get your MAs done
B	yeah of course yeah
A	yeah we'll join the club
B	I know it's about that it's so much reading so much reading
A	are you gonna get I think you were saying we were gonna get distinction?
B	it's basically yeah yeah are you gonna distinction?
D	yeah yeah yeah probably
B	oh that's
A	that's amazing isn't it? and you're pretty much
D	technically
C	yeah really
D	sixty-nine
B	oh oh oh oh oh
C	if I get another sixty-nine I'm gonna be
B	is that what you got in your undergrad? yeah
D	no
C	yeah I got sixty-nine
A	ah that tastes bitter we got exactly the same grade
B	what did you get in the end? cos
D	I got
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah so did I
B	well
D	I think I got sixty-three
A	oh yeah
B	did you? yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah one of those
D	or something like that no there's a two one there's a two one
C	and in the first we
B	but no that that means shit shit if you get a distinction for your MA
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	if I get it
B	it's okay yeah
C	I think it's cos cos you can get like a sixty or sixty-nine
B	when did you get the result?
D	erm yeah that's what I'm saying whenever they mark it
B	whenever they mark it
D	I like
C	oh really?
A	I got one first then I got like seventy-two or something that was it that was the only first otherwise er we were hitting like sixty-six sixty-seven sixty-eight it's pretty much
B	yeah I've got a couple of firsts that's
A	but I mean I
B	we actually got exactly the same grade we both got sixty-seven point five
A	really exactly the same sixty-seven point four yeah sixty-seven point four
C	er do they not write?
B	and then we got completely different grades
C	oh they rounded it down
A	so it's just sixty-seven
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	but I mean I was like
B	oh yeah like sixty-eight
A	we were busy with other stuff
C	yeah
A	so I kinda tell myself maybe I could've done better
B	I mean that's fine for an undergrad
C	yeah the thing is with an undergrad anyway you don't really pay too much attention
A	no
B	no no no
C	you just trying to
A	I want to do it
B	no exactly
C	no no
C	but then as
A	it does limit you you know
B	yeah that's true
D	yeah that's good
C	but she's doing her Masters along with that so
A	oh you don't want to turd
B	yeah I had an Irish teacher
A	what
B	when I was beginner he's like you can get a first or a second but you don't want a turd no I want some turd and I know he must say every year to like
A	mine was
B	to like freshmen every year you know and he does it with the straightest of faces you don't want a third no one likes turds
A	well two two's a drinker's degree isn't it? a third is just what happened?
A	I just got a third
C	a third one is do you know where your uni is?
A	yeah yeah
B	exactly
C	that's the first question
A	you remember your student name right? I think that's six digits
B	cos I remember I was I mean the first year I just scraped passed but that thankfully doesn't count
C	yeah
A	yeah
B	how kind of you
D	as soon as soon as everyone finds that out
B	yeah yeah
D	everyone's quite
C	yeah
D	and I as soon as I found out you need forty
B	yeah
D	or a or a forty-one
B	yeah yeah it looks bad on your transcripts
D	cos if you if you want a
B	mm
A	yeah
D	grades
A	and also for us like
B	oh that's true yeah
A	abroad
B	taking it after us
A	they don't really care so much about the degree they wanna see our transcripts they wanna see what
B	yeah it's true
C	yeah
A	modules we did and what grades we got so
D	mm
A	actually it does kind of matter because it shows
D	mm
B	yeah
A	that we were shit and we were shit
B	cos one of my one of my English
C	yeah I mean that's true
B	was like a forty or something
D	mm
A	yeah you dropped English and we teach English so English was good and
B	yes
C	yeah it was like a forty
B	I dropped English
C	but you just like you
B	you've got to read the books
C	yeah I know that's quite new in England a forty's very high
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	but that's another problem
A	that's another problem as well
B	yeah because actually
A	they're like you only got a sixty-seven that's terrible you know
C	yeah
A	cos Americans will get like ninety-fives
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	and ninety-sevens and three point nine average
D	mm
B	and hundreds like
C	ah yeah
A	yeah
B	no one gets near a hundred
C	no
D	and they kick you
C	but when erm yeah like
A	yeah yeah yeah pretty much
D	and then they have three more
A	exceptional
D	yeah
A	have you ever known anyone get beyond an eighty?
D	yeah
C	I did
A	you did?
B	oh
A	fucking hell
D	for one it was an online exam like it was easy I think I got used to that
A	oh it was an exam so yeah
B	oh
C	eighty-seven er for your Masters?
A	an exam is kinda like you get along alright
D	yeah yeah yeah it was an online exam it was like a twenty-minute online exam it was just like anatomy and physiology and stuff
C	yeah it was an exam
A	that'd be
D	no I take exams
C	no I'm not very good at exams
B	yeah yeah
C	I don't think many people are
B	I used to be better
C	very good with exams
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I'm not very good with exams
C	I think most people who are good with exams tend not to be very academic
A	yeah
C	but the people that are very good at memory like
A	memorising loads yeah
B	memorising stuff
A	are good when they were doing their GCSEs but didn't really care enough
D	mm
C	yeah didn't really worry too much
B	no no
A	ended up being big Christians got married young
A	just thinking of someone in particular
C	specific yeah
A	yeah I think so yeah
C	yeah I was gonna say
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I did fancy I did fancy her and then I
B	and she
A	that happened she repulsed me so it was horrible
C	oh
A	she had a really smelly breath like
C	oh
A	one
B	oh well now she's a Christian
A	yeah that was a while ago now different different
B	you've changed now you
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
B	when did that did that start this September or last September?
C	erm I don't know no I think
B	that group
A	mm
C	erm but yeah I knew
B	until he's eighteen
C	so I guess
B	oh okay
C	I think that like this year next year
A	I think like our college
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah yeah you cancelled it
C	yeah like sixteen years
D	he stopped being
A	I've got a five-year-old half brother
B	which is why I spoke to
A	mum had one at forty-seven
B	her college is an under age
A	a bit old isn't it?
D	yeah
C	they're getting older
A	they are they are
C	I think it's sensible
A	I think there're times that we may be might be ready to have children would be in our forties but I think like
C	yeah
C	wishful thinking
B	they're in their forties they're not twenty-six
A	forty yeah
B	maybe
B	yeah he said that to me that's frightening I mean actually it's kind of good for the babies for her
C	yeah
A	yeah for her but I mean if you don't want children having the menopause isn't gonna
B	but if you haven't had kids yet and you're considering it
C	no but I think it's very nice
A	I am right your periods stop right? that's
C	yeah
B	well maybe they you like
A	because you're hot flush feeling weird hormonal
D	very cold
C	the kitchen sink
B	yeah that's not that's not quite
C	yeah
B	imagine a girl like her
A	do you want to develop a tablet for that? you know of medical attendance
B	well they have cos they slow it down but you have to eventually just confront it
A	and then you get hairier and hairier don't you?
A	basically
C	I think
B	cos you never know this
A	it's a long grey whiskers you get not thick enough to be a beard but
B	enjoying that
A	pluck them
B	yeah yeah he you don't care at certain point then do you?
A	you can do what you want
A	but do prefer it
C	but I must insist
A	yeah
B	get you shaving this
A	your armpit hair was pretty long before
B	yeah
A	that gold German
B	yeah that's alright
A	it's just weird for girls that because it's not thick it's kind of wiry do you know what I mean? it looks a bit odd to me when a girl grows her armpit hair
B	I don't know
C	did you get it long enough to plait it or?
B	no it was not that long
A	oh god
B	it was never that long just a couple of weeks of growth
A	shouldn't wax it kinda give a moustache
B	yeah
B	nah it was never that long it was never that long
A	stick it out yeah
B	it was not a big deal
B	not that
B	yeah I neglected my shaving
C	yeah
A	you're finding that you're just getting hairier and hairier
D	yeah?
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	no but I
B	growing growing back hair? do you have any back hair?
D	oh yeah
A	I used to have back hair
C	no
B	just getting a little bit some more hair
A	I'm getting more shoulder hair or
B	a couple down at the bottom that's it
C	oh that's no you're okay I think for the moment
D	yeah I'm alright
C	your dad wasn't very hairy though
D	yeah he was
A	yeah
C	was he?
D	a little bit
C	was he?
D	yeah
C	really?
A	some people
D	yeah I know I think it took me a while
A	yeah
C	bastards
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	I think I was a late bearder
B	no
A	my brother's
B	ah that's fine though
A	my brother's
D	yeah
A	twenty-
D	mm
A	I mean I had one at eighteen
B	he's
A	nineteen
B	I think he
A	I'm not sure
B	maybe
B	we'll get there eventually
C	yeah I know I'm really really
A	some quicker than others
D	yeah
B	is it? I do have one hair that grows through a mole there
C	oh
B	yeah
C	I might have like my nan has one
B	I don't have
C	on her face and it's like
B	ah
C	it's horrible
A	gross
C	I look at my nan and I'm like oh my god that's me
B	yeah
C	like that's gonna be me in like fifty years
B	yeah
B	I do remember my nan getting quite wiry in the end yeah
C	did I tell? I don't know if I told you my
D	oh yeah I remember
C	yeah so I found
A	oh wow
B	ah
C	and it's really thick and it's like wire like it almost it's like the consistency of
B	ah
C	like Africa
B	yeah yeah
A	that's like negres you're growing in
C	yeah yeah
C	like the it's really weird and I found
[ANNOTATION]	my nan is from africa	Neutral
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	we're not racist
C	and then that was it and I spent the whole night just sat there
B	looking for another one?
C	literally I'll probably spent all of tonight now doing it
B	and yours still wasn't grey I suppose
[ANNOTATION]	yours is grey	Contradiction
A	I'm starting to go
B	it's weird your hair is just fair
A	bleach white hairs on my beard and
C	yeah that's what I said
B	yeah you've got the odd grey coming through
C	I don't think it's gonna become grey

B	yeah yeah he's got
A	yeah

A	mine's actually
B	yeah it's actually
[ANNOTATION]	beard is lighter than hair	Contradiction
A	I've got that hair really blonde
D	it's much patchy but I've got the moustache waxed
A	yeah
D	hold it in place
B	yeah yeah
A	ah you've been doing that yeah
D	and that darkens it up a bit so yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah nice
B	yeah
D	I don't know what it is with my hair it's darker it's darkened
C	I don't know
D	I don't know if you realised it goes darker
C	yeah
D	cos
D	er yeah had a little bit of a long beard
C	when we were in yes it's when we were here for New Year's
D	last time we came to
A	oh you were here for New Year?
D	yeah
C	yeah we came here for New Year
D	a few years ago
B	to see your uncle?
C	yeah it was a couple of years ago
D	mm
C	two or three years ago?
A	where did you go?
C	er we just went to
C	it's amazing
D	this is where the action is
C	if you're here for New Year's like go there
D	just go go to the beach
A	I think we will yeah
C	go to the beach cos at midnight the whole seafront is populated with people setting off like Chinese erm paper lanterns
B	ah paper lanterns yeah
A	yeah
C	within the
D	loads of people drinking and smoking
C	it's er it's so it's so nice
A	do you wanna join us for this New Year?
C	yeah it's like
A	wanna do it again?
D	oh we'll be in
B	oh it could be in
C	yeah we'll probably be in
B	when does your job start?
A	yeah when will you find out?
D	er well they asked me how long my erm notice period is so
B	oh yeah
C	two weeks
D	I'll probably be in
B	yeah you said
A	we'll be here for New Year
B	awesome
D	mm
B	you
C	all of them
D	all of them
B	all of them yeah yeah
A	what do you mean all of them? how many jobs do you have?
D	three
A	three? oh yeah
D	but I can't get enough balance in one
A	what are they? what are you doing?
D	er so I work at
A	yeah
D	then I work at
A	do you get like free uses of the gym?
D	yeah
A	that's pretty good
D	it's good but it's at a terrible gym
A	ah no good
D	and also I was writing my dissertation and it's
A	no
B	ah it depends
A	I mean if we can get enough
B	probably still got
A	hours and work
D	mm
C	but the contract and the recording
B	recording thing yeah
A	we've just enough to carry us through
B	if we can keep recordings
A	we've got enough money to like pay bills pay for food get to uni and back for the whole year
C	yeah
D	mm
A	but like we wanna come and see you guys and and go to other places we need some spare cash
B	yeah we would like to walk to a pub or do anything
A	and this thing pays about eighteen pounds an hour which is
C	wow that's good
D	pretty good yeah
A	but it's actually quite difficult to record people
D	mm
A	you guys are like sound but like
C	can you not will you be able to take it to uni?
B	yeah maybe
C	record your classmates?
D	just take a
B	well no I don't know if it has to be conversations not er
A	you need
C	but it could be seminars
B	yeah yeah
A	it can't be lecturers seminars I wonder about this but you do need
C	yeah
B	but we have to get as long as we get permission it's okay
A	you do need written permission from everyone we're gonna give you the form in a bit it's like a two-page form that you have to fill out
C	yeah
A	but provided once I've got everyone's permission in a class then I can just record every class
C	you keep doing it yeah
B	yeah
A	if I wanted to
D	yeah
B	yeah that might be as long as people are willing they might be willing
A	mm
C	also you can just go like go to the
B	yeah
C	stand near someone
A	I've been through linguistics recently
D	yeah
B	would you like to do?
C	would you tell me about what have you been doing?
B	in the school
A	as long as it's something in our field is what is like Cambridge University Press so
C	yeah well it's like
A	a bit lucky
C	you know what is like look at like
B	yeah like that's also an option
A	yeah
C	just you like an evening
A	definitely
D	it's also kind of at the uni as well cos your Masters
C	yeah you have to have tutorials
D	they only employ Masters students stuff like that?
C	they
B	oh really?
D	because you know it's just typing
A	well we'll look into that
B	oh really?
C	yeah
A	we definitely
B	oh that's fantastic
C	yeah
B	cos that's just one-off stuff
D	it's a more open job
B	just to earn you a bit more money
C	yeah
D	mm
C	they are good things to do
B	yeah
A	I mean we could teach in
C	yeah there're so many
A	like here or something so I think we could get some I don't know if they hire us part-time but I think maybe we could get some hours failing that I might put some posters up for like private tuition or
C	yeah
A	proofreading or something like that
C	I was gonna say like your proofreading and like copy-proof and that stuff
A	mm
C	would probably be
A	we were proofreading like
C	just
A	in our last job like PhDs theses and stuff
D	mm
A	but that was terrible
B	yeah
C	because they're
B	because they have to produce them in English
A	the standard in Korea I don't know how it's like you know
B	ah I don't think it's the same standard
A	no it's not the same standard at all
B	it's terrible
A	well I mean fair play to them they're producing a a PhD thesis in a foreign language
unknown_female	yeah
B	that's true
A	that's really impressive
C	it is impressive
A	but the content of what they were writing was so repetitive I mean we probably got paid they split a thesis between four people and we were two of the people and we probably got a hundred pounds each I think for doing maybe we did like twenty pages each or thirty pages each something like that
C	I guess that's not too bad
A	no the money was okay it was like
C	yeah
B	yeah they were quite
A	it's really hard what is she trying to say?
D	mm
B	they were quite hard weren't they?
A	no but this thesis was just so repetitive the abstract was the same as a literature review it was the same as yeah everything was the same it was just
D	yeah
B	about like
A	what was it about? like some kind of wool trade in Mongolia or something
B	trade in Mongolia
A	so that one in particular
B	I think she may be Mongolian I don't know but
A	yeah she was Mongolian
A	yeah
D	there was a guy
B	really?
D	yeah
A	can you do sport science?
D	yeah
A	yeah
B	ah
C	ah you laughed at
D	a bit of a chat
A	yeah
D	he told me seemed pretty interesting
A	you wanna do a PhD?
D	er well I applied for one but I didn't get it and I wouldn't just do one er the only reason I applied for it cos it was
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah but I mean you've got many years left to keep applying
D	yeah well
A	if you wanna do it
D	I'm only gonna apply for what I really wanna do
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure what he apply	Neutral
A	yeah for if you see one that comes out
D	mm
C	you need to get the funding as well this is the thing like
D	yeah
C	PhDs are incredibly expensive for what they are considering you have like no contact hours
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about PhD	Entailment
B	yeah it's just
C	you have like one meeting a month it is like three four grand a year I suppose or something like that?
A	it doesn't cost so much
B	yeah
A	but you can get complete funding
C	which isane yeah you can
B	yeah you can try to get scholarships and things
C	yeah because
B	then they want specific PhDs
A	we were
C	usually yeah
B	yeah
A	if we did a PhD which we'd like to do then we're trying to do it we'd considered doing it in like America or Canada or something so that A we can get a foot in the door
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure can do it or not	Neutral
A	to potentially getting dual citizenship somewhere else and then B there's a lot more funding for foreign students
C	yeah
A	than there is for
C	generally is you're a foreign student there is a lot more funding
C	in England as well
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about England	Entailment
C	like
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah it's depressing like I go in the
B	we can't apply for any
A	yeah it's like any of them we can't get any of the discounts
B	did you get a discount for being a
[ANNOTATION]	person B is talking about discount	Entailment
C	yeah I did
A	like a grand or something?
C	before it was different though because I
B	yeah straight though yeah
C	so you finish your MBA or whatever you do and then you go straight into your MA but because I come under a alumni I think I got like ten percent off
B	okay
A	mm
C	something like that
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about MBA	Entailment
A	fair enough
C	it's better than a kick in the teeth
B	yeah yeah
C	and my tuition fees
C	weren't bad either like
A	yeah
C	were like
D	mine was fucking ridiculous
C	seven and a half grand
B	ah shit
A	oh jesus
C	and mine was like five
B	oh fuck
A	we we paid six
C	five grand? something like that? yeah
A	we wanted to go to
C	yeah
B	but we yeah we went to
A	we applied eight it went up to eight
B	and we thought the cost of and also like once we're actually in Edinburgh we were like ah slightly defeats the object of being in England
A	brand new
B	cos no one's gonna visit you in Edinburgh I mean maybe once in the year
A	yeah this is a good a really good location
B	but they're not gonna
A	people would come and visit us which is what we want
B	yes
C	yeah
A	we'll be back for a year
B	yeah
A	but we're not I think we're gonna move on after that so that's kind of
B	that's gonna
A	and also once you've kinda lived out of England you start to price yourself out of the market a little bit
D	mm
A	you come back and you're like a pint in a pub is five pounds
C	yeah it is
B	on a bad day
A	I was just in Cambodia where a pint was fifty cents
B	mm
A	it's just like thirty P you're like thirty P five quid I think I'll drink at home
D	mm
C	yeah I think that's normal though like everything has gone up quite significantly
B	yeah
C	in the past few years as well like
B	it has in the last few years it's quite a lot
D	yeah
B	you're
A	but
C	crazy enough
A	we've been impressed by how the price of food I guess cos of how much we were paying in Korea but like
B	yeah
A	all the food's cheaper here than it was in Korea
B	yeah food isn't cheap supermarkets aren't that cheap in Korea
C	yeah
A	everything else is cheaper in Korea
C	yeah
A	but food is not cheap
B	especially stuff that we wouldn't buy
C	yeah
A	like a bag of potatoes would be like four pounds or something like that
B	yeah
A	it was like one carrot was two pounds fifty
B	yeah yeah stuff fluctuate there a lot with like seasons and stuff like that
C	yeah that makes sense
B	they do it
C	but like if you get
A	like if you buy
C	and you learn to buy the season
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	then things will be cheaper
B	there were things that
A	we had to do seasonal in Korea
B	although some things that were all year round and they were obviously imported cos they were
A	yeah
B	they weren't growing bananas
A	but then were a lot of
B	but they would fluctuate
C	yeah
B	one week they would be like three pounds and
A	it's like the very same comes
B	the next week they would literally be seven pounds for a bunch of bananas and then the next week it would be down again like you feel like the supermarket just kept doing what they want to make more profits and
A	watermelons
D	mm
C	like this big
D	oh yeah you get much more
B	yeah you can get bigger ones yeah yeah
A	I haven't seen bigger ones since I've been back but then you get them in Korea we get ones like that they're huge ones
C	wow
B	yeah
A	I mean they're like ten kilos or something
B	in season yeah
A	and when they're in season they're like three pounds two pounds fifty for like a big one it last us a solid week no worries we've eaten as much watermelon as we want everyday
B	yeah yeah
A	but out of season that same watermelon would be like fifteen pounds twenty pounds for the watermelon it goes up to like thirty thousand wons thirty-five thousand wons
B	yeah it was hard to predict what your bills were gonna cost each week
A	yeah
B	whereas here it's consistent we just know
A	it's consistent
C	yeah we
B	we buy the same things and like
C	yeah and you don't really
B	sometimes strawberries will get cheaper in the summer and that's good but
C	yeah I think that's the one good thing about British supermarkets is you're gonna be paying like the maximum price and the only way it'll go is down
B	down yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	it tends to be and it
B	and it does yeah yeah yeah
C	happens every January
B	and there's a lot of
A	I've been impressed by that
C	oh yeah
B	and supermarkets
A	we were getting you know most of the week shop for like twenty-five pounds I reckon maybe we spent thirty to thirty-five pounds for the two of us for the most of a week's shop
C	yeah that's pretty good
A	yeah
C	you need to go to like Lidl
C	are you going to Lidl?
B	yeah we've been going to Aldi
A	Aldi yeah
C	Aldi
A	we don't have a Lidl nearby but we went to Aldi
C	Aldi
D	what's the frozen one?
C	Iceland
D	Iceland
B	yeah
A	is that any good?
B	yeah we
D	cheap
C	it's cheap
A	er but do they have more stuff than just frozen stuff?
B	what
C	it's just
D	yeah they do both it's stuff they they have frozen stuff
A	yeah
C	you wouldn't really buy they do do like
A	we don't really buy much frozen stuff
C	butter and like fresh stuff but if you go to
D	you can get that
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	and then getting like
A	it's a bit scummy around there though
C	yeah I mean
D	I don't know the way they operate
C	I don't know if
C	do they
D	oh
C	at the desk you just like throw it
B	oh I've noticed that they
C	into
B	they
A	take aside and
B	we weren't we haven't been but yeah they're like
B	I remember a
A	do they shout at you though?
D	they
C	yeah they do
D	they're like can you move that out of there? well no
C	yeah
B	mm
C	I could but I'm not going to
B	oh dear
D	no I'll do it here why can't I do it here? shouldn't you be helping me with it?
A	mm
B	are
D	that's what you get paid for
A	that's your job yeah
B	er non native speakers in Aldi in
C	no
B	but the ones here they're all like
A	foreign
B	they're all foreign
A	yeah they're foreign
C	well I
D	it's a good job
C	it's like amazing really good
B	oh dear
C	like really really good
B	wow
D	you do everything
C	yeah
D	it's not just like
C	so the person that serves you at the till also like
D	coming for the till you do everything
A	still?
C	takes in the stock cleans the shop floor
A	wouldn't you rather?
A	mm
C	like they do everything
A	I'd rather do that
C	I don't think it's kind of good but it's a pain if you're a
D	I think there're less staff as well
C	customer because
D	cos there're never all the tills open
C	yeah they never have they
B	yeah yeah
D	they they always have the minimum amount of staff they need
C	only have one or two tills open
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	it doesn't matter how busy it is you always queue for the same time
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	if there's like five people in there there's only one person on so you still queue for the same time
C	yeah
B	for the same amount of time yeah that's annoying
C	but yeah they do pay really well actually
A	I would
C	er
D	six thirty over twenty-one
C	six fifty? yeah it's about that
B	oh six pounds thirty?
D	over twenty-one yeah
B	oh
C	yeah
B	yeah but everything's getting more expensive
D	I don't know where
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	kind of
B	we haven't had any bills through yet
A	no we had a problem Korea that we couldn't just go to one supermarket could we? they're all in different directions and like everyone stocked different things you can't find cheese at that one and you can't find pasta in that one so it was
C	oh right
A	it's kind of
C	how my my sister does that though like she goes she shops at Aldi Asda and Iceland
B	ah yeah
C	she gets like all her frozen stuff from Iceland all her fresh stuff from Aldi and then like the kids' stuff at Asda
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	and it makes it like so much cheaper
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	because
B	selective
A	yeah you need to yeah
B	yeah so that you can get
A	do you know
C	I've been here a couple of times I don't know it really that well I could recommend like a really good cocktail bar but I

B	yeah yeah yeah
A	were a bit crappy and like
C	were they?
A	the price you don't get very much for your money and it's
C	I think it's
A	run-down and like
B	yeah yeah the land was definitely not
A	they just treat students like crap when you think
B	yeah yeah
C	when you think like
A	between the five you're paying like fifteen hundred a month on that property and it's
B	it's just the landlords yeah
D	mm
A	a piece of crap
B	yeah when you're each renting the room
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	like we have friends that were renting out houses and they were paying like four hundred pounds per room
B	yeah yeah
A	bloody hell
C	it was insane

C	we'd only been there for like
B	oh bless your mum
C	so bad
A	I'm being attacked
C	we'd only been there for about three months and a girl got raped on campus
A	oh
C	like very close to the
C	that's a different story but
D	yeah cos she
C	so no apparently she and her boyfriend broke up so she thought saying that he raped to get him back
B	oh nice
C	classic
B	a logical
B	yeah he
C	I'm definitely I'm definitely sure that worked erm so we didn't know about this until like months and months later so before we'd even heard about this
D	yeah that was
C	a girl had been raped like walking home
B	yeah yeah
C	erm
B	in the woods
C	just finished work and it was about one in the morning and my mum was still up because she always stayed up quite late so I was on the phone to her and I was like I don't like it it's really dark like quite a lot of the sort of lamps had gone out erm
B	it was really late wasn't it?
C	yeah it was really late and I could hear like someone running like quick footsteps coming behind me and I told my mum
A	sounds like a rapist
C	I know right?
C	the sound of rape
B	where's my mum?
C	I can hear someone
A	I'm gonna
C	I can hear someone behind me I was like there's someone behind me I was like I'll be fine I'll be fine she was like

A	no
B	it was one in the morning
A	no what's he doing jogging around at one in the morning?
C	yeah it was one in the morning right?
D	he'd probably just finished work was like there's no one about I can jog
B	yeah yeah yeah let's jog I bet you scared the shit out of him
C	he was like I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm fine and I was like
C	and my mum was on the phone like I dropped my phone on the floor you could hear my mum screaming
B	oh
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	I was like I'm fine I'm just like possibly giving a jogger some kind of like
D	and he never jogged again
B	never jogged again in the future yeah
C	he's probably like really
B	he comes out on his bike from now on but he'll
C	he's like
C	I like to think so
B	yeah that's good
A	I'm not a rapist
B	no that's good that was you near-rape experience
C	my near-rape
B	yeah
C	but yeah that was er that was my one experience but

B	mm yeah
C	like I didn't even see it
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	oh right right that was the
A	I can't believe they're on a grand a year now
C	I think it was like about that
D	yeah
C	yeah I know
A	my brother's gone come out with like a fifty grand debt or something ridiculous
B	ah it's so much
C	I know
A	it's so big that it's just I don't care
C	yeah this is what I was saying that you might as well
A	it's just you know
C	like when they
B	yeah
C	how much is it? twelvety twelvety million
D	yeah it doesn't matter I'm not gonna buy that the government's paying

B	yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah
A	I haven't heard of that reference
C	you haven't?
A	no I do know League of Gentlemen though but not that well?
C	but it's just like it's like a yeah it's just a
A	can I can't?
C	I can I can't
A	that was League of Gentlemen
C	yeah
B	did you watch Mighty Boosh?

B	yeah it's Baileys
A	this one's Baileys mm creamy
B	American friends liked it
A	do you love him?
C	yeah
A	make an assessment
A	so yeah so we saw it recently so obviously I've heard of Mighty Boosh the whole time but then
B	I've seen some episodes but I didn't recognise him from it
C	yeah it's
A	we were always like I really like Brass Eye and Peep Show and Look Around You that kind of stuff
C	yeah yeah yeah that's a classic
A	that kind of stuff
B	but you don't like Peep Show
C	yeah yeah yeah I love Peep Show
B	ah okay

B	sorry I thought that was someone else
A	out
C	I'd be like yeah
D	there's someone who doesn't like Peep Show who is that?
B	is it
C	you know I think it might be
A	is there like one person who doesn't like it?
B	yeah
A	is that the one who hates everything?
C	yeah
A	mm it's too cool and once you like what she likes she doesn't like it
C	that's why we all have to like animals so like
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	I was told that was a hipster once but I barely knew what it bloody was
B	yeah we never know what the term meant
A	I went to America I think some guy was trying to insult me and he was like you're a hipster I was what?
C	yeah like I guess I would kind
B	yeah yeah I think
A	I think he
D	mm
B	we didn't know before we got to South America we haven't heard hipster before
D	mm
A	yeah
C	it's kind of I still think it's something that like I'm particularly au fait with it's just
B	oh yeah yeah just people trying hard
D	no no I'm never quite
A	if if a hipster is a a bit of a hippie that doesn't buy clothes but it's still a bit more
C	yeah I'm not sure cos I always thought a hipster was one of those people that
B	that burden
A	a bit geeky? nerdy?
C	no I guess like someone who like purposely likes things that they know
B	yeah they'll wear something that's really retro just to
A	oh
C	yeah just to be
B	terrible
C	like different
B	or look different
C	no I thought
A	oh is this
C	yeah
B	B
A	B yeah she
B	it's funny you remember that you don't know the twins but you remember
C	they obviously don't have anything interesting to define them
B	I haven't seen
A	it took me four years just to to get to terms with her family so
C	yeah she's got a lot of brothers
B	yeah
B	er
A	especially people that you've not really met
C	it is hard
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	ridiculously big family it's like they're breeding like it's coming out of action
D	it's not that bad
C	I think you know something that we don't
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	they're just like go go go go
C	there're so many of them so many
B	there's one girl isn't there? one that's
D	there is one yeah but you have to breathe a while that's why
C	yeah
B	just one
C	yeah they
B	oh shit just one little girl
A	my family used to be smaller
C	yeah
A	but it's gone er gone much much bigger
B	since your parents married other people
A	used to be just me my mum my dad and my brother and then it became my mother's partner and his two children and then their children and then my dad's partner and her children and their children and it just gets on on and on doesn't it? then you come and home and it just a bunch of people you don't really know
A	apparently that's family
C	hi
A	mm
C	just you know er dealing with a bunch of people that you don't really know very well
A	yeah
C	definitely I'm sure that's not maybe biologically but
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah

B	but you were like irritated
D	oh right
A	it's like you know
B	I was meant to be out but I
D	mm
A	useful
D	mm
A	the interesting part of this is if you're into kind of social history in fact
D	mm
A	so I've been in corpus before and
D	mm
A	at the
D	mm
A	and then you know statistically they'll find out which is more common like
D	yeah
A	all those sorts of stuff but they never got a decent voiced you know their corpus voice and now they're getting one which should effectively you know
D	wicked
A	you guys you know somebody in a hundred years in the future wants to know what the people sounded like
D	mm
A	then they'll be listening to this
D	it's cool
D	I want one and when
A	yeah
D	the type species
D	there's no so there's obviously every species has like a skeleton on file in the British Museum

D	which museum?
A	I think
D	er the Natural History
A	the Natural History yeah right in the entrance is

A	is that what happens with syphilis?
D	yeah yeah
A	what do you mean by the bones were peered? like
A	what causes that? like just like
D	it's just the
A	the relation of the
D	yeah so yeah the bone weakens and decays
A	don't get syphilis syphilis right?
D	mm try not
A	no it's the
D	mm I don't know it may be
A	I think it is I'm not sure

A	oh I'm sorry I'm not very good with my gangster history
C	I don't know actually I think he was based loosly on a man

B	oh really? yeah
D	the last episode's good
C	yeah

C	mine was historic space erm
B	what was it about?
D	it was on Chaplin
C	historic
A	okay
B	okay
C	erm and how he you can observe space as a kind of
A	delineate for me space what do you mean space?
C	like the construction of space so the filmic space of
B	the
D	like the
C	not like the space between the spectator and the screen not how the spectator engages with the cinema and that
A	no
B	but the actual setting of the scenes and the spaces
C	but the actual yeah setting well it would be called like the
D	like the jargon and
C	like everything's there
C	yeah that somehow
A	was it interesting?
C	yeah it wasn't it wasn't like the research was really interesting
B	yeah yeah I know
C	and I love Chaplin so
B	it was really good yeah

D	Recovermax isn't as good as they would like you to think
B	they would like us
A	of course as with every Glaxo Smith Klein product
B	but it's
A	we were worried about doing this linguistics dissertation weren't we a little bit?
C	you were saying that it's hard

A	we're changing subject effectively
D	mm
B	yeah yeah

B	yeah he's been going through this
A	this is language structure so this is do you know Noam Chomsky?
D	mm m
C	yeah
A	this is his transformational exbar grammar so it's all like erm
B	it's very scientific and quite complicated it sounds
A	it's all like there're so many movements and rules and principles and conditions
D	grass?
A	that arise it's about universal grammar
B	oh
D	can I do some grass?

B	when did you have
D	I think it was alright?
C	I don't know we had moved in
B	we slept in the front room oh yeah
D	oh yeah I know what you mean
C	yeah you slept
B	yeah yeah there was
C	we moved
D	yeah cos you
C	oh my god er to move the stuff cos the
A	Romania
C	lived round the corner
B	was it clean?
A	I didn't know that
C	no not doing it and he was I swear it's clean it's fine so there's pictures of me and our other housemate
C	and like kitchen utensils like picking up
A	oh gross
C	so then it was so yeah I was just not not comfortable touching
A	we've got two pretty good stories about filthy people haven't we? when we were last living somewhere there was this woman that
B	oh
A	she was notoriously she was the
B	yeah she had a Masters
A	in the university she was very well respected
B	I think she even had a PhD I'm not sure English woman in her thirties
A	she said she'd been studying for years she was running the
C	oh okay
A	which is the next step for us when we like go on and er she was filthy I mean we went in a room somebody let me in cos they were saying you got to see how filthy this is and we knew the different door codes so we went in
B	the door code
A	she had a box with okay in Korea you can't when you wipe your ass you don't put it in the toilet it goes in the bin
C	yeah
A	you have a little poo bin she had poo paper like in a box in her living room so there's like poo strip paper on there it was like
B	cos the place was just filthy
A	the place stank
B	you
A	so she was there
B	and she lived in that I don't know how she lived in that
A	and then there's another guy that we had called
B	herpes
A	he was always like
B	not quite the same
A	flaring up on his belly like I mean like he'd always fuck these girls and they'd be really noisy and stuff
B	they were all from uni
A	but he was
B	his room was filthy and after like three months
A	he stopped it
B	he finally cleaned his room
A	well we would say
B	rubbish bags
D	yeah
A	and then bring it in the class put it dump it out and then you sort it
B	and then use it it's like in your face theatre
A	so like but the problem was the only bag they stole was
A	from the one time that he cleaned his fucking room
C	oh
A	and they're making me
D	mm
A	B there're probably loads of condoms and shit
B	there were loads of condoms and all that kind of thing
A	he takes his shit like condoms in bottles and stuff I was
D	oh
A	like I'm not cleaning this I'm not doing it but they were a bit pissed cos I kinda ruined their performance a bit but I was like seriously
D	you still
A	but she
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	they'd taken bag and that's wrong
B	yeah yeah
A	they could've stolen the toilet bag or something you could've found like tampons and shit you know what I mean?
B	or the kitchen's just
C	yeah that's pretty
B	I mean that's fine but
A	yeah really
B	it was specific
A	it was just
B	yeah yeah
A	then like a big poster of dinosaurs or something
A	something like
B	it was definitely
A	yeah something really random
B	you end up with some random stuff at uni though
D	mm
B	even when you choose who you live with which you do in the second and third year you move into houses but jesus you still don't really know people that well
D	mm
A	did you enjoy your bachelors?
D	yeah it was good yeah it was fun
B	mm good fun yeah yeah
A	I had good fun
D	mm
A	and being a bit carefree and that kind of stuff
B	yeah yeah it's definitely
A	I take it the MA's not the same kind of experience
D	no more work
B	yeah yeah a lot more work
A	we've doing it for one year
B	are you taking? like I don't remember being nervous when I first went into my bachelors
D	mm
B	genuinely very nervous
A	yeah do you think it'll be harder or easier doing it in one year?
D	er probably easier
A	yeah?
B	yeah?
D	cos obviously you'll have more work to do but then
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	just the same workload anyway
B	just the amount of workload yeah
A	yeah
B	I guess it depends on the hours
A	the problem is we're going into work and another addition for us is that we've just come home after years of living abroad so
D	mm
A	loads of people wanna see us and visit us
D	mm
A	and all this kind of stuff so I think we've already got a pretty hectic schedule
B	just gotta keep on top of it
A	they give you a reading list and I'm doing four modules this semester and
D	mm
A	and each reading list they give you like ten core books and then another twenty extra books
D	mm
A	you've got like thirty books per module
B	yeah
A	it was like a hundred and twenty books that I meant to read until before Christmas
B	I feel that's surely they'll just focus you on some chapters
D	fuck off
A	we've already read all of those they're up there
B	yeah yeah yeah have we?
A	yeah I've pretty much read all of those
A	yay
B	I always go for the skinny ones
A	it's expensive enough doing it in one year I I suppose
D	mm
A	it's kind of cheaper doing it in two years
B	maybe
D	well
A	if we were living in England I'd probably do it part-time but
D	yeah we didn't get any cos we thought
C	yeah
D	we thought that we weren't gonna get not have to pay council tax
C	yeah but that's the
B	yeah you do yeah yeah you have to be full-time
D	cos you're not full-time mm
C	yeah that was er but then
B	oh okay
A	oh why?
C	cos you just have to be a
D	cos we were doing more hours or something
B	oh right
C	modules and because you're doing your
B	dissertation
A	that counts
C	and that counts
B	two modules
C	two modules
A	it was a hundred and eighty credits in total
C	no
B	no no your entire Masters
A	your entire for two years
A	yeah entire two years
B	your Masters
C	oh my entire two years? erm yeah yeah a hundred and eighty credits so over the second year there was it was almost like being full-time
A	why are the credit systems different? I've never really understood like a hundred and eighty credits is ninety European credits
B	which is the same as forty
A	which is the same as forty-five American credits
C	oh really?
A	so they just they keep dividing in half I don't really understand
B	in America it's always two years
A	yeah a Masters is always two years in the States
B	yeah
C	mm
D	yeah it's different in America I know the PhD is different cos it's more PhD via research or via publication
A	yeah
B	yeah
D	so their thesis is made up of
C	that's what I want
A	just do you want to get
C	no no no erm the
D	I gave it to you already earlier
C	oh did you?
B	yeah yeah
A	oh the the vape
C	sorry
B	oh that's okay
A	yeah I know we need to stop
C	I can always er I'll sit on your lap
A	yeah no no no we've got four chairs so we should be able to get round
C	okay
A	we've done pretty well family sorted us out we've got like stuff
C	no no
A	it's a very hodge podge kind of
D	mm
C	you know what? like
A	bric-a-brac for
C	I think it's what all houses are
A	yeah
C	anyway unless you are in a position where you can buy a house I think you kinda resent like filling like a
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	with nice furniture anyway
A	nice furniture
C	it's like it's just rented so like
A	have you seen the bedroom?
C	no no
C	oh yeah no that's fine though isn't it?

B	yeah yeah
D	but like I don't know where the card is so
B	no no my I left my card in my
C	sorry do you mind if I smoke this in here is that okay?
B	why would I mind? I don't think it even does anything does it?
C	no but
B	cos you're not smoking actual cigarettes and
C	do you?
B	I don't like shishas and things like that
C	yeah that is hardening
B	cos they're just
C	that hurts my lungs
B	er what that does?

C	yeah but it's quite it hurts your throat
B	oh this one is stronger yeah
C	it hurts your throat doesn't it?
B	oh that one's weird try that
A	what's that?
B	I feel like that's way better than the one that our friend had in Korea but it does taste slightly stronger it's stronger oh that's actually quite
A	it's
B	we had one that was bullshit ones in Korea
D	what's the flavour?
B	watermelon
A	watermelon
B	yeah
D	yeah that's the strongest one see you do get a little bit of a throat tingle off it
B	ah yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah
D	which is what
B	which is what we like
B	but they're different
D	it's er
B	the instrument and then the
D	yeah at first you
B	oh yeah you can
B	yeah?
A	where's the other tea towel?
B	in the washing machine
A	that sucks
B	oh no you can still get it out
A	alright well
B	just don't wipe anything on there
D	the rest is like a fiver
B	oh okay and how long does that last?
D	mm I don't know normally about a week or so if you
C	yeah it depends what you do like cos
B	mm
D	mm
C	but he was there like he used to smoke it literally all the time because you don't have to roll a cigarette it's just there
B	yeah I see yeah
D	it just goes off you don't have to roll
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah and you literally just like that whereas I
B	I think it could be like increasing your nicotine levels
C	well we were talking to
A	well there's
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	so we were talking to
B	mm
C	I remember when we saw him on like New Year's or Christmas
D	mm
A	was he telling you about the
C	yeah
C	well he was saying about how like they're starting to
B	yeah
D	mm
C	but that's but because of the fact that you get social smokers who don't normally smoke all the time who just wanna give up the social smoking would start those and then end up smoking that
B	more than they would've done with roll cigarettes
C	more than they would've done
A	yeah
C	so and that's like
D	mm
C	he would maybe have a cigarette and that was it but then when he was on that he would just smoke it continuously
B	continuously yeah
C	from like morning till night
B	yeah
C	and
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	that's a good rule of thumb
B	it
C	well I did yeah exactly I didn't smoke at all
B	you don't do it any more yeah
C	I haven't smoked
B	without alcohol
C	without alcohol for like four years something like that
B	yeah yeah
C	so it would be
B	yeah I don't I can't do it every time you light a cigarette I'm like
A	I don't do it a lot by I do occasionally have a cigarette or stuff
C	there's only like a few occasions when
B	yeah
C	I just thought I want to smoke and then maybe I'll pretend that I'm drinking
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	oh this lemonade er er er
A	this is the problem we were on cigarettes
B	yeah yeah
A	we have like two
C	yeah you have to intensify it cos as I was saying
A	we're gonna study
B	yeah
C	when you start sort of
B	we
A	oh
B	we're not gonna smoke unless we're drinking but then it would be like twelve o'clock
C	oh
B	oh it's beer o'clock
A	yeah
B	I don't have to go to work today so there's nothing wrong with this
C	it's I think it's like
B	cos when we're drinking it's like
C	a good kind of rule of thumb
B	yeah it's a good
C	to do because I think some people when they kind of are going on to the stages of quitting smoking some would just be like I'll just have a cigarette in the morning or I'll just have a cigarette after dinner
B	yeah
C	or just have a cigarette before bed whereas if you just say oh I'll just have a cigarette when I'm
B	drunk
C	or drinking then you can kind of control that because you can say okay well I'm not gonna drink
B	drink yeah
C	and then I'm not
A	if I'm
B	in a social situation
C	you'll finding you're not alcoholic yeah but you know as long as you can remove yourself from that situation you can't remove yourself from eating or waking up or going to sleep
B	no that's true
A	quite a few alchies in Korea weren't there? we lived there was a lovely girl but
C	wow
A	three bottles of red wine
C	that's a challenge
B	yeah yeah
A	she would she would on average get through fifteen to twenty bottles a week and I would be no worries she just
B	well she had a lot of people over as well all the time but
A	she does but the more we got to know her unfortunately Korea's a really bad place if you're an alcoholic cos you you don't have that support network of your friends and family to kinda maybe help you out
D	mm
A	so you kinda just get a bit lost
B	or break
A	and people come and go so they don't know the full extent of how much you are an alcoholic you know what I mean?
C	yeah
A	she had a really alcoholic friend
B	yeah it was we had a big we had a
A	one in the afternoon I'd have a beer but
B	Christian ladies that worked with us and stuff
A	yeah but he was he turned up down a bottle of champagne to himself a bottle of champagne downed a bottle of wine to himself went off and shagged some bird and like gathered another three of those bottles of
B	it was a mess
C	oh my god
A	and just no he didn't vomit over himself
B	no no he poured chilli on himself
A	he was eating a bowl of chilli and he spilt a tiny little bit and then he was like fuck it and just poured the bowl all over himself
A	and he was a wreck the guy was a wreck
C	oh my god
B	it was a mess I think he like knew people around him knew he was a mess
A	jesus yeah
B	yeah there're definitely some really terrible people that shouldn't be teaching
A	no how did you guys get into teaching?
C	I mean that's like in England
B	yeah I guess it's the same for every job
A	every
C	that's worse in other jobs yeah
B	yeah
C	it's like I was saying to a friend of mine who went into teaching
B	oh
A	those can do those who can't teach
B	teach right?
C	yeah and that's how he was
A	I hate that saying
C	he always said to her and I was like that
B	that you're not good enough to do something else
C	you're not good enough to do anything else
B	yeah
A	mm some people actually want to teach
B	yeah
A	we need teachers
C	loads of people that's why it was so terrible when I did my PGCE because I
A	you've done your PGCE?
C	I did like the first take but then I was like no I'm alright
B	yeah yeah you did that
A	ah okay
C	I ended up in like the boys grammar school
A	I've heard it's pretty intense
C	and it was fucking insane
B	oh did you? where? in
A	is that a shit?
C	it was really it was like a couple of hundred years old like three four hundred years old it's turned into an academy now
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	and
B	oh no you don't I know that you can
C	but it was obviously
B	oh
C	I'll explain what happened
B	yeah
C	er
A	classroom management classroom management
C	so yeah it was
A	classroom management's definitely a part of it
C	it was it was so so so bad erm so I was just monitoring the class while they were I think they were writing like a GSCE paper or some rubbish and
B	mm
C	write up a paper and then you're gonna read it out like in the exams
B	oh okay
C	and
B	yeah yeah
C	so who was like fourteen fifteen he was a bit of an emo kid he had like a fringe cross face he was very dark haired and he I walked past him and I saw on his computer that he was researching gang rape on Wikipedia and he was talking about I know right?
B	yeah
C	and
B	it's not funny
C	so I was like
A	gang rape
C	yeah
C	what can I do with that? and I literally kind of just sat there for a minute laughed a little bit to myself and went get on with your work
C	and that was the last day I went in I was like
B	oh
C	it was so bad
B	did you do some actual teaching?
C	yeah yeah yeah I taught for like
B	yeah yeah
C	a couple of months
B	was it English you were teaching?
C	English and media
B	yeah
C	but it's like in English schools it was it's just absolutely brutal
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	like I kinda
B	it is brutal teaching in public schools
C	oh my god it was so horrible
B	it's brutal
C	and er cos they try and like make you aware of everything that's going on of like the books like the students who want books of like the kids that are in your class who are being like abused by their parents and
B	mm
C	stuff like that and they literally don't hold back I had like five or six child protection meetings and the shit they came up in that I literally had no faith left in humanity in the end
B	oh oh oh
C	it was horrible and she was saying just teaching
B	just in your one school?
C	yeah just in
B	yeah yeah
C	and the first time I was in
B	yeah
C	as well
B	ah okay
C	in this school but in other schools
B	yeah
C	over the past like ten years one of them involved a boy not being in her class so at the end of her class she went to go to reception to find out if there was a reason why he wasn't in that class met him on the corridor and was like why where were you this morning? you've missed my class and he was like oh we found out my girlfriend's pregnant so we had to give her an abortion
C	I'd just I'd just go home
A	I'd resign
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I'd resign
C	yeah I would just go home I'd just be alright you might wanna go to his girlfriend's house you might not you might wanna just get
A	no
B	go find out
A	we never never wanted to teach in a public school in England
C	it's it was
B	no no no no but it Korea
C	so horrible
A	I mean teach teaching in a public school in Korea wasn't a cake a walk in the park
B	no no no that's an all boys' school
A	it was okay and then we avoided all of this
B	they were like animals
A	kind of stuff because it's in a foreign language
C	yeah
B	yeah but because we weren't natives
A	and we
C	yeah if you yeah
B	we weren't responsible for that side of things
A	we weren't but also because we weren't natives we weren't respected as much
B	no yeah
A	which meant that we had to put a lot more effort
B	lots of students didn't understand you
D	mm
A	and quite often you quite often had cool teachers but for the most part I was left on my own and you got like between thirty and forty students that don't speak your language that are just like trying to understand
B	they just go mad like like an all boys' school they're like animals
A	it's like there's a lot of discipline I had a brick
B	not whilst you were teaching
A	I didn't like no that was in at the night time and
B	I did have one in my classroom that did smash whilst I was teaching
A	one of my students well the girls would often come in with bruises on their calves where their teachers had hit them or like my male students got their head shaved like in school like just the whole school got their head shaved
B	oh but that's common these days though isn't it?
A	I was at a bad school I was like
B	yeah
A	I mean so you went to my feeder school in the end and that was a really bad school as well but erm
C	yeah
A	cos you know it was
A	so I invigilated it's really boring walked around for hours just doing nothing but the first exam I ever invigilated was a two-hour exam and I remember really clearly that this student fell asleep within about ten minutes of the exams completely down on me and I remember looking at the the head of English and kind of giving him a look you know communicating without words kinda looking at the student
C	yeah
A	being like you know is that okay?
C	he's asleep obviously
A	smacked him twice in the head
A	in his fucking head the student gets up gets grabs the pen starts writing
A	I was wow oh my god like
C	you'd literally wouldn't be able to do that here
A	I would never could've pointed that out if I knew
B	yeah yeah you're not meant to do it in Korea any more but
A	no oh it got banned while we were there
C	no right no oh really?
A	yeah
B	but within reasoning we'd still do it like they know like in my boys' school they know their parents like if they hit them a little bit they know their parents aren't gonna complain or anything
A	no
B	we're meant to be looking after this child
A	which we had to do eventually
B	they spend I mean like even from primary school though from a really young age
A	but I
B	they'll make them like walk down at the corridors and squatting at the same time
A	I used to
B	or like make them hold a position for ages
D	it works
C	wow
A	I'm I used
B	yeah yeah I mean
A	dunce cap
B	within reason I mean
A	I genuinely use one I I get the student up stand next to me you try and get them to help you
B	yeah the cap is good
A	help me teach you know what I mean? do the board and stuff but it just doesn't really work so I get them they have to balance this cup that I'd drawn an unhappy face on they had to balance it on their head and if it fell off
B	some people would
A	then you know I'd get angry and
B	actually you know
A	you get a red card or whatever and that'd be like bad thing so they really like trying balance this this cap
C	that's good
C	that is crazy
A	they would stand balancing
C	that's but then I do think there's like
B	you can do that yeah
C	there's nothing necessarily wrong
D	at school we had that
C	with that thing
B	in
D	yeah
C	in schools at the moment kids are like very very aware of like
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D has not gone to school.	Contradiction
B	the
C	not just in schools I think generally people
A	yeah right
C	are just really aware of like their rights
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	and what you can
B	especially
C	and cannot do as parents
D	of what they can tough
C	and like as a teacher
B	yeah yeah
C	I remember one of the things I got taught while I was training to teach was like if you have a kid for detention you sit at your desk the kid sits in their chair if they have an allocated chair or they just sit somewhere
B	mm
C	and if that kids decides to get up and walk out the class like at no point can you interfere with that like you can't grab the kid you cannot at any point shut the door while you and the child are there
B	you can't trap you and your child in there
C	you can't stand in the doorway because that's seen as like predatory
B	mm
C	you can't chase the kid down to his house
B	yeah it's all about your behaviour isn't it?
C	yeah so all you can do
B	inform reception
C	that the student had vacated the classroom and having said this that's a reception problem
B	yeah
C	and that's it
B	mm
C	it's it's
B	I mean I think it's
C	yeah
B	and also cos parents like pay for their children like his standard that you probably get paid to go er you parents will pay you to go to
C	oh
B	they are paying for their afternoon one and that's when
C	yeah
B	the students are meant to study so the smart students I had some really smart asses that were like well my
A	yeah
B	but then they wouldn't say that
C	that's unfair
B	in English as in in another language
A	they work them to death
B	also they like
A	my high school they're going to
C	that was what
A	in Russia
C	and had like he went to like normal school then he would finish
B	mm they made
C	school for a couple of hours and he would eat and then he would go and do private tutoring
B	oh god
C	he was really good at maths though
D	mm
C	that guy was like phenomenal on maths
B	yeah
C	but and also
B	yeah
C	he liked making carnivals was interested in
C	yeah he went there with a really weird face of like
B	oh did he?
A	five minutes
B	oh five minutes
C	yeah it's kind of I had a really odd kid in my school erm who was
A	oh
B	yeah
C	I felt terrible for this kid
B	oh
C	his mum used to walk him to the school door this kid was like we're talking
B	secondary school yeah
C	he was yeah secondary school so year seven he was
B	oh to pick him up?
C	and walk him home
B	was he special?
C	no no no no his mum was a bit special but he
B	ah
C	you know she was just so obsessive over him but we had this he he was
B	yeah
C	and he does something and the teacher was like right after school detention where you have to obviously check with the parents and the mum was like no and he needs to be home so we could never give him after school detention
B	after school detention ah
C	and he knew we could never give him after school detention
B	really?
C	because the mum refused to let him stay because
B	yeah
C	she wanted to like I don't know like comb his hair or something at home
B	oh no oh oh oh
A	lovely
C	so he could just do whatever he wanted so he was like he would swear he would purposely like so he was this real he should've been a really smart kid who
B	yeah
C	who worked really well because he had no friends and his library was
B	he was the other end of that
C	but yeah because he knew he could get away with stuff he kinda figured that that was his way in like he could be the naughty kid and ergo he would make friends and it doesn't matter because he'll never get in trouble really
B	trouble really yeah
C	so he just became this really
B	oh
C	odd kid that never really fitted any kind of social group
C	and I just don't really know well in
B	oh yeah
C	I don't think any of
B	oh jesus
C	and she used to wear
[ANNOTATION]	The kid goes to primary school.	Neutral
A	it's the mark of a cool person isn't it? fluorescent
B	and
C	yeah
A	tracksuit
C	she used to walk them like straight to the door
B	oh
C	like even this kid the kid must've been about like sixteen
B	yeah
C	seventeen the older boy
B	yeah I know no fuck off
C	yeah I think really
[ANNOTATION]	The older boy doesn't go to college.	Entailment
A	oh god yeah we'd often have like three special needs students in our class but nobody knows what's wrong with them
B	and we
A	and then nobody helps you with them
B	and there were definitely kids that were like I don't know if they were made they were really intelligent they'd been like the top set and they'd know like I had one boy in particular he'd like
C	wow
B	for the different countries and stuff like so I think it was like
C	sounds awesome
A	er kind of autism mm
B	autism yeah
C	yeah autistic spectrum
B	but at the same time like all the students hated him because they didn't he didn't like
[ANNOTATION]	The special needs students have autism, ASD and learning disabilities.	Neutral
B	socialise in the same way
A	mm
C	and he would do things like I was trying to
B	the other boys they don't think in English
A	one drew a big penis didn't they or something?
B	ah yeah that was another student drew a massive penis in class boys are funny man they're just
A	don't forget to wash boys are easier to teach than girls I think genuinely
C	I think boys generally are easier than girls
[ANNOTATION]	Boys are easier to control than girls.	Contradiction
D	girls
B	girls are a little bit more insane but my boys I think my boys' behaviour
D	boys are louder
A	boys are louder
B	is much worse than your girls' behaviour
A	but I could get them to work easier
D	mm
A	I had girls that were just didn't bring a pen didn't bring paper refused to do anything just sit at the back of the class and don't do anything and like
[ANNOTATION]	Girls are more mature than boys.	Neutral
C	yeah
A	I had a girl in my last class
B	I like to teach boys
A	and this is a uni and they're a lot better behaved but I mean first class I went to check on her work and she brushed me away like this she was like
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	The girl speaker A talks about wasn't feeling well that day.	Neutral
A	but by half way through she really opened up and I don't blame her she didn't wanna speak English she didn't wanna study English I can't really blame her for that
C	yeah I think that's the thing when you're kind of forced into
B	she was straight out of high school so she
A	yeah yeah
B	still carried on with high school attitudes
A	you have to understand these things as a teacher I often think that some of the best teachers will probably be students who weren't very good students I wasn't a very good student at school so I can understand the students
C	yeah I guess you
A	that aren't really good at school yeah
C	have like empathy with them
A	I think
B	don't take things too personally
A	I wouldn't have liked to have taught me
C	I don't think
A	you went to the same school right?
A	you went to the same school?
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	that was that all girls?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	chapters and
C	yeah
B	that was three years and we never got rid of that fucker
A	but one of your friends wasn't was it
C	yeah
B	they went to a different school
A	they they weren't
C	it was only us out of all of us it was only us that actually went to the same school wasn't it?
B	yeah yeah
C	because
B	they were
C	never
B	no no no
C	oh and
C	yeah and
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	oh of course yeah she did didn't she? because that's why she's really good friends with
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	so yeah
B	they got on really well yeah
C	I do remember now
B	yeah
C	no no no I don't know I don't know she
B	or something yeah

C	I might of erm
A	my dad did my dad came out
B	yeah he did your brother
A	my brother did yeah
B	mm
A	I had a few friends who came out to teach there
B	mm
A	we were living if this is Korea
B	mm
A	and my friends moved to like Norfolk and it was about as far away as it could possibly be and my best friend moved there and then my other best friend moved to exactly the same city
C	oh
A	so they were both together and they saw each other a lot but I didn't get to see them at all
B	completely randomly neither of them chose that location
A	yeah yeah it's a small world
C	oh
B	it's not up to you to decide where you go
A	this is like four hundred cities in the country so
B	mm
C	that's so cool
B	yeah yeah
C	I know we'd like to come up I wanna get to I
A	mm
C	I wanna go to
A	where's
B	why?
D	near
C	yeah
B	near Dubai?
D	it's er
C	it's like
B	do you know anyone up there?
C	no
B	oh really?
D	yeah all the
C	I'm from
D	er traffic lights and other things are on the ground
C	you get your own little pod and you sit in it and it takes you to like
D	yeah drive theirs cars or whatever
A	that's
B	really? driverless cars?
D	yeah hundred percent
B	holy shit
A	we're pretty much gonna live in in the Middle East probably for the next few years
C	the Middle East is quite
A	it's where it's where the money is
C	I was gonna say yeah you're gonna get a lot more money
A	we'll be on well we'll be on double what we were on in Korea almost
C	mm
A	and then the fact that we don't pay rent and then they cover us flight and you get a bonus a month every twelve months you do you get a thirteenth month
C	oh wow
A	it's something good about Korea
B	mm
A	it's quite a lot everyone gets it
C	mm
A	so yeah I actually worked out that I I found out with the amount that we could save in Korea fourteen grand in Korea was like being on thirty or thirty-five K in England because
C	wow
A	to save like seven or eight hundred pounds a month
C	yeah
A	and pay your rent and do everything else I think you need to be on about thirty K thirty-five K in England
B	mm it's probably about that
A	mm so imagine it's pretty cool well it's not bad isn't it? we came back pay tuition pay the rent
B	mm mm
A	just got enough to live on
C	that's what happens there
A	yeah
A	England just sucks it out of you doesn't it?
D	mm
C	yeah it is very expensive
B	mm yeah really
C	but all the profit
A	mm
D	mm
A	and you pay for what you get
B	more or less yeah
A	I like the culture here as well like the work that stuff I miss that in Korea a lot
B	there's like crazy looking people a lot of people that you're like man he's got a hard life
C	yeah
A	yeah so that
B	you don't think that so much well definitely not in Korea anyway
A	no
B	but you're like looking
C	looking
B	yeah
D	I
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah basically
A	I've got to get my
B	yeah
D	I let them run that park
C	yeah we watched a really interesting but strange surreal probably a better word like vice documentary
B	mm
C	about North Korea
B	mm
C	and erm
D	it was
C	yeah a guy went in and did like I don't know just some
B	yeah
C	but they were like he had kind of secret service men with him like all the way round and I guess like a lot of it was kind of like
B	yeah no one's gonna eat there just tourists
A	mm
C	and
A	mm
B	mm
C	so they knew you were coming like days ago
B	yeah yeah
C	and erm
B	mm
A	yeah
C	apart from the TV
B	whatever is on TV yeah
C	yeah
A	it was definitely strange living there it was something that you know it was always in the back of your mind and it did flare up a few times when we were there
C	mm
A	as soon as something starts going down we lose money and I've watched the exchange rates for like five years in Korea now and what we were on I suppose like fourteen fifteen grand
C	oh
A	and that would fluctuate by five K depending on the exchange rate so at the very worst we were on ten K year at the very best we were on fifteen sixteen K yeah so it really made a difference like
C	wow
A	it really changes what you're earning basically
B	yeah
A	and I there were a few good things they sank that boat there was there was the sinking of the Cheonan they five shells at Yeonpyeong island so there was like probably three or four quite big events while we were there
D	did they shoot the missiles over Japan while you were there?
A	yup yeah we were over there
C	oh
D	that's
B	oh yeah the entire testing like
A	and then you get your family ring you up and worrying about you
B	but then you
C	I would've
B	yeah
D	who is the next one?
B	yeah the
D	well I like crazy fuck your crazy neighbour
A	whatever yeah
B	they could just be like
D	it doesn't matter
B	weapon testing that the media turns that into
A	the media spins it
C	yeah
B	oh
A	definitely
B	yeah they definitely do
A	they leave Korea for a while and you
C	yeah
A	so Koreans are used to that it's been going on year in year out for fifty years so
B	yeah forever
A	they don't when this stuff kicks out they're not bothered
D	yeah
A	it really doesn't affect them
A	because if you ask the older generation they wanna reunify if you ask the younger generation they don't
D	mm
A	so chances are they're not going to
B	it's not a good idea
A	in general yeah
B	in general they don't think it's realistic
A	definitely crazy being you know North Korea is one of the craziest countries in the world and like it seems in ten years
C	it does sound pretty insane
D	they won the World Cup didn't they?
A	yeah
B	ah bless them
D	not bad
B	was it in like seventy-eight against Argentina or something like that?
C	yeah
B	yeah it wasn't Argentina was it? probably Bolivia or something
C	it would probably like yeah probably was like
D	yeah it wasn't Argentina it was an African team
A	Burkina Faso
C	yeah
B	we watched
A	in Argentina? yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah we saw the game in Argentina it was quite fun
B	mm
A	we're not really into football much but it's fun seeing them live he has the ball ah
B	yeah it's fun watching watch football
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	we will go to those things we're not into it but it's part of the culture so
B	yeah yeah yeah

A	yeah
C	that was just my voice
C	also I was saying when you were saying
A	good effort
C	I said to
B	good effort

B	yeah yeah yeah she's crazy
C	that's good that's like four hours worth of
B	yeah I know
A	mm
C	it's fine
A	yeah
B	sheep people
C	er
B	oh yeah where's she?
C	she's at his drama school thing there's
D	who's this?
D	oh right yeah
C	there's like seventeen people in her whole year
A	wow
C	and she got a scholarship to go it was like thousands and thousands of people but
B	wow but I think she's good at performing
C	but she's one yeah I think she is really good at
B	she must be
C	but she won the
A	the
C	the Laurence Olivier
B	yeah
A	yeah
C	not so much MDF
C	a lot less brutal
A	cos that guy was a bit brutal
C	I wanna call it a boudoir
B	what did she get? she didn't get money for that kind of thing?
C	yeah she got
B	mm
C	you start at nine and you finish at seven
B	yeah
C	so you can't work
B	mm
C	you could only work so she works Saturdays and Sundays to pay like her bills and stuff and they pay the
B	oh nice
A	I I only found out recently from
B	what is how long is that course?
A	they were saying
C	three years
A	they were saying that if you go to uni at at one of the Oxbridge like Oxford or Cambridge you can't work
C	mm
A	you're not allowed to work
B	cos to get to university yeah
C	yeah they do not allow you to work
D	I didn't know that
A	mm
C	yeah you just go to university
A	alright just to make it even more elitist
B	and also they say if someone says to
C	yeah yeah
D	mm
C	just in case you
D	the reason is they want you to focus full time
A	cos they want you just to
B	oh yeah
D	on your studies
B	they if like you're not studying you have to be participating
C	yeah
B	in an extra curricular stuff
A	yeah but you need to have enough money so that you can survive
D	yeah
C	but the only good thing is is like when the tuition fees went up
A	the same yeah
C	the grand scheme of things they're like one of the cheaper universities
D	affordable
C	to go to
A	yeah
C	because they offer like
B	oh
C	really really really really good packages for erm I wouldn't say like
D	they've got quite a lot of programmes for you that you can't work
C	underprivileged but people from low income
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	no you can't work but you there's no way you'll pay half of what like the kids that have come from Eton will pay for your tuition
A	yeah
B	tuition ah interesting
C	they'd still be like kind of means-tested they whoever they are
A	mm that screwed me that means-tested thing my parents had recently divorced so they were giving I lived on my own for a year to save up money that's how I could afford to go and then
C	yeah
A	I didn't know that
D	mm
A	so I tried to be self-assessed after a year they told me I couldn't be I had to go
C	yeah
A	because their partner they had enough money that but but then they didn't give me a penny
D	mm
A	I haven't have anything from them so
C	yeah that's not good
A	I felt like I got a little bit raw deal on that one
C	I missed out on the means-tested
A	other people were getting loads of like benefits
C	they finished means testing the year before I started
A	yeah
B	oh did they?
C	yeah so everyone just paid of like everyone pays like a flat rate
B	you didn't get I thought
C	and I could not
B	oh okay
C	you get more money from
B	you get extra grants though then
C	yeah you get like extra grants
A	yeah
C	like maintenance grants and all the loans and stuff
B	oh that wasn't like that when we were there the tuition still costs the same
A	I'll tell you what
B	but
B	you just got more in grants or more in loans
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	I'll tell you what
B	but you didn't get anything
A	if I had known about this access course I might have just
D	yeah
A	got in to a pretty good uni
B	yeah
A	that's like a top thirty uni you know what I mean? and he's
C	oh yeah but like he was
D	that's what we had access courses
C	like four twenty-three twenty-four
A	yeah
D	and they look more favourably upon it cos you're older
A	yeah you get a better you get into a better
C	yeah
A	uni because of it
D	mm
A	but he completely screwed up his college and his A levels and all that kind of stuff
C	yeah and that's exactly what we did
A	but got into a good uni
D	mm
C	we did access
D	yeah
C	which is just a like a quick way to get into it
A	I wish I'd known that
B	just worked for a couple of years and then
A	yeah
B	do the access
C	it was good I think it was it's good as well because nine times out of ten by the time you've done an access or you get round to doing an access course all of your friends have already gone on to do better things like
A	yeah
C	or go to uni or go travelling or whatever it is
B	it's a motivation
C	so you are a lot more kind of like
B	motivated
C	dedicated
A	mm yeah
B	you would sit down like an easy year working full time when
A	mm
C	yeah and like I don't wanna do anything so
B	they don't know how shit that is
A	I personally think that in general I don't think that you should be allowed to go to university until you're twenty-one
C	no
A	I honestly think that they should be a break and you should travel work do whatever it is
C	mm
A	but it makes me laugh that you're seventeen and eleven months and you're not you can't be tried under the the law the proper law like as an adult but as soon as you click over to eighteen here's a fifteen grand debt
D	mm
A	a debt that's gonna last for thirty years of your life I honestly think that if you put uni back and say that you're gotta be twenty-one to go to uni some people that wouldn't normally go to uni would end up going to uni because they would've figured their life out a bit more and other people that were just floating through maybe wouldn't have gone in the first place
C	yeah
A	because you have to consider it a bit more
C	no I don't think it was a bad idea I think it's probably quite a good one
B	many access courses are like saying it is the only thing that we can do
A	mm
C	but part of
B	yeah
C	and over the
B	like they've changed that now
A	mm
C	but now they're talking no they were talking at one point about taking it down to like sixteen
A	what?
C	so you could just do that instead of doing your A levels
B	and then go to university when you're younger?
C	I guess so
A	what?
D	mm
C	and I was no you like it's completely
B	yeah I don't think it's some er
C	it deceives the point like and also part of the reason when you do
B	experience of uni
C	you do an access course as opposed to doing A levels
B	yeah
C	you don't have to sit with a bunch of like sixteen-year-old kids who do not wanna be there
B	senior olds
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	and they're not gonna learn
A	but now you're gonna have to be with sixteen-year-olds
C	well if they do it I don't think they will do it
B	but you could potentially be with sixteen no no no
C	because
A	yeah
C	because it's it's the A levels for adults you know?
A	when they put the prices up for uni
B	I don't think that's
A	there was protesting going on right?
C	yeah loads
B	there was a lot of protesting yeah yeah yeah
C	there were things at my uni like everything
A	anything happen?
C	lots of
A	as in did they make any ground? did they?
C	yeah er we're not gonna do it and then they did it anyway
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	well
A	so protesting is kinda pointless isn't it? really
C	yeah and it doesn't really work very well
B	you don't achieve so much with that
A	yeah they've got so whipped here
C	there was a really good option that I was really pro for erm
A	you pay a tax so it's like
B	tax which is what they call my student loan yeah
A	which is effectively what our student loans are yeah
C	yeah
A	student tax
C	you pay like ten percent of your wages so if you're on a hundred grand it's obviously a lot more
A	yeah yeah
C	than if you're on fifteen but over a certain amount you pay a student tax
B	yeah
C	and then everyone pays it
A	do you guys still have bachelors loans?
B	that's kind of more fair because then they're like
C	yeah yeah of course mine's like twenty grand
D	mm
A	yeah fair enough so more than ours then
C	yeah
B	yeah well she you had to top up fees didn't you?
C	yeah I
A	as yours was three grand
C	yeah mine was three grand a year
A	oh what's that topping up? having a bank account
C	oh it was yeah
A	they just looked for some modern terminology didn't they? everyone's topping up their phone
C	yeah oh yeah
A	we'll er we'll top up our bank account top up fee
D	yeah that's good
B	oh yeah yeah yeah it's
C	yeah well let me know I'm paying this it's like
B	yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah yeah
D	well I didn't pay it you've stolen the money from me and I haven't got any money
C	and it's like
B	no yeah you've got a certain amount haven't you?
C	this is the thing with student loans is you yeah you have to earn
D	yeah
C	and with a nine grand you now have to earn like twenty thousand or something of like this
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah
B	with the fees I was gonna say
D	yeah
B	it depends on which country you're getting it actually
A	oh it's been ridiculous in Korea
C	mm
A	we've been paying off about fifteen pound a month on our student loans
D	mm
C	mm
B	on average it's gone sometimes it's three pounds
A	cos we weren't making enough we were making enough money to clock over so I basically owed
B	but in Korea it's different they our
A	exactly the same as I owed before I've just been paying off the interest
D	mm
B	our student loan was like
C	you don't have
B	if you earn over fifteen grand or whatever you pay nine percent but because we were living in Korea it's anything over nine grand
A	yeah it changes country to country
B	that in that country you're actually earning
D	mm yeah
B	a small
A	yeah it's equitable
D	mm
B	yeah
A	your loan will actually be cleared quicker than ours I looked into them
B	your top up fees
A	and the top up fees will be cleared thirty years after you start after you take the loan so
C	yeah
A	when you take the loan say if you're twenty you only pay
C	but then there's
A	like by fifty they'll wipe it
B	oh really?
D	mm
C	yeah I think it's after twenty
[ANNOTATION]	A has worked in the bank for 15 years.	Neutral
D	yeah
B	really?
A	thirty years
C	is it
A	I looked into that
[ANNOTATION]	A has taken the time to see how this loans work.	Entailment
C	is it thirty? yeah
A	whereas ours
C	it's
A	ours is
B	until we're
A	until we're sixty-five
B	or that
C	oh really?
A	so because we took out the other loan they won't wipe that until we're like sixty-five so
C	but I mean it's kind of one those it's not like they're not gonna come take your TV
B	no no no exactly
A	no no
C	and so it's
A	but
[ANNOTATION]	They would hate having their TV taken, it's their pride and joy.	Neutral
C	I don't really have
B	we've had some
A	they do send some very threatening letters
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	and they
[ANNOTATION]	The letters from the bank even have a threating colour to them.	Neutral
C	do they?
A	yeah to us
B	they send letters and stuff
A	because they live abroad and like there're times when we
B	and it's just miscommunication
C	oh
B	and shit on their part
[ANNOTATION]	They never send letters because a person comes over every three months to check on them.	Contradiction
A	when we go travelling they don't believe us that we're not working so they send out loads of letters to our family and they're quite threatening letters all red like you owe us this all this
B	they actually threatened us and something like this
A	all lies just complete lies they're not real you haven't been paying this you owe us this we're gonna send the bailiffs round and do this and they do all through a subsidiary company called
B	it's
A	isn't real it's just student loans companies
A	it's just the same company
B	they created a secondary company yeah
C	ah
A	but they scare you by thinking that it's this
C	yes
A	and they put the word law in it
C	yeah yeah so it sounds
A	yeah
B	my friend's
A	but they don't have the right to do anything but
A	but it still scared our family they were like ah we
B	they've been taken to court about it recently
A	who?
B	because it's unethical
A	oh because of this
B	yeah yeah
A	so we've received quite a few dodgy letters from them and it's a bit of a pain in the ass to tell you the truth every month logging into this website just to pay them ten pounds or something fifteen quid
B	yeah they take it from your wages
C	yeah they take it from my wages but it isn't high
A	we need to get
C	I paid when I was like in recruitment they took out money for like two years
B	yeah yeah it's
A	oh yeah your recruitments so that was good money
B	yeah but you you were two years in recruitment
C	yeah but even then like I was on pretty good money I was on really good money
B	yeah
C	but
A	what did you earn? if you don't mind
C	like well I had a basic of like twenty which isn't that impressive
A	mm no that's fine
C	but I got commission
A	mm
C	and I got quite good commission rate and all the jobs
A	yeah
C	so like ten percent of that
A	nice
C	and so it's quite good
A	it's topping up by another six seven grand on top of everything
C	well depending on how many people you employ and I was quite good at recruitment if I
A	you were
A	we almost we almost
B	gifted
C	if you get recruitment can be really good
A	before I know
B	like
C	like if you get into the right
A	my cousin is a recruitment consultant she loves it
C	if you get into the right type of recruitment if you do high street recruitment your life's gonna be horrible and miserable and led by people who like you have some really horrible
A	it's got to be
C	horrible people on recruitment you hear some really scary stories about
A	mm
C	and you help people that own the job and so it's it's almost working at a job and you find the candidate and you split fifty fifty but
B	oh that's just in in in jobs that
A	cos it's commission there's a bit of a fight yeah really
B	oh yeah
C	yeah so would like yeah like
B	I thought you meant like from customers
C	no no like customers I mean customers
B	no
C	but like yeah the actual fellow fellow staff and would possibly
B	your colleagues
C	yeah fuck up your day so that they would get your money and you wouldn't
B	ah
A	I've always had kind of ethical issues with
C	but
A	the middle man jobs you know what I mean? like recruitment consultancy and stuff did you feel like you were helping the employees
B	state agencies
A	or is it purely just making money out of the employees and the employers?
C	I mean it's hard the thing is it's difficult
A	mm
C	it was like sales directors and managers and
A	mm
C	like people who like built satellites and stuff
A	yeah
C	like that so really smart people who were really good at their jobs
A	so you're putting these people in touch with each other basically
C	so yeah so all I was doing if someone would hire me like
A	mm
C	and then just like push them through an interview
A	yeah
C	nobody got the job that they
A	cop it yeah
C	erm
B	wow
C	yeah so
B	it's a massive incentive to stay
A	a massive incentive to kill you
C	yeah yeah exactly his wife was probably like
C	erm
B	that job
C	go to
A	yeah
C	but then
C	you know I'm here to like
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	to do this yeah
C	make you yeah you know I'm here for the money
C	yeah of course and he I mean you're not talking it's not like quick turnaround either like people are on like three month like
A	yeah do you get money depending on?
B	yeah
A	if they pass the probationary period and that kind of
C	so no you would get like a a fee so the recruitment company would charge a fee to fill the job they the job they get the fee and then what would happen is if someone walked out after like a day then you would have to refund the fee a hundred percent
A	yeah
C	and then like the longer it went on
B	oh the fee decreased
C	and the fee decreased so I think it was up to about six months
[ANNOTATION]	The fee stayed the same.	Contradiction
A	ah okay
C	if they
A	so you were already hoping that they stayed there
B	oh six months there it's still quite a long time
C	yeah but mostly they
A	did they drop out much?
C	I had one woman
D	ah
C	and she wasn't sure what to do so she'd taken the job at the new company and because the
[ANNOTATION]	The woman had worked at a company before.	Neutral
B	had she?
C	well because they're all really high level
B	yeah
C	they can just not go into the office for like
B	they get like office hours and meetings that kind of stuff
C	or yeah and then they're like I'm in a meeting or whatever and she was just working with the other company
B	working from home
C	and then just made a decision after a couple of weeks and was like I'm just gonna stay
A	I mean I guess at that level of recruitment I understand that it's probably quite difficult for some people to get in contact with their jobs as in when they drop out
[ANNOTATION]	It is easy for people to get in contact with their jobs.	Contradiction
B	well you're providing the service to the companies
C	yeah
A	you are providing a service
B	it's not necessarily the people you're hiring yeah yeah
D	yeah it's the company
A	yeah really
B	yeah it's the company that has to deal with this shit
B	yeah yeah
A	it's the lower down shit munchers that kind of think is a bit harsh like cos you're taking money off pretty much every hour
B	like you said the high street recruitment
[ANNOTATION]	The company has nothing to do with it.	Contradiction
A	I'll tell you what I really had a problem with like er job seekers allowance now
C	I did
D	I went once cos I was told I was entitled and it turned out that I wasn't
[ANNOTATION]	They were indeed entitled to job seekers allowance.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	oh
A	pointless
D	they only said you should be able to claim this cos er you know
A	they made me jump through hoops last time we were here
D	mm
A	yeah I need some some dental work and I know that's gonna cost but I've heard about people and like your brother and other people once they've been on it long enough they make you do a really shit job like Poundland or
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	They have worked at Poundland before.	Neutral
B	mm
A	something and you still get the same fifty pound a week
C	yeah
A	but you have to work forty hours and then you're on about one pound twenty a week
C	yeah
A	so what you're saying is that job is available cos we can put you in it
D	mm
A	we're gonna make you do the job for one pound twenty an hour
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	what I understand at this point why you don't just go
C	yeah
A	there's a job here it is
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	you know what I mean? rather than we're gonna make you do that job
B	well just
A	yeah there's a job fill the job
D	mm
A	I don't understand why there're loads of job under
A	why they don't just give you a job cos
C	yeah
A	there're always jobs that need filling so
C	I mean there's yeah I agree
B	there're people that need them
C	I think I with the
D	yeah
A	not gonna happen is it?
D	no cos they don't want the job
A	but that's what I'm saying put them in the job
D	mm
A	if there's a job seekers allowance
B	yeah but they don't want to do the job they fuck it up
C	if
A	I don't see why they should keep your benefits if they go they find you a job and you don't wanna do it well that's the end of your benefits
D	yeah
C	yeah but then
A	we found a job
B	it's within reason now of course cos obviously you put people there that are completely
A	yeah I I know of course you need to do something within your qualifications or
B	it should be after a certain amount of time or something
A	or it needs to hit certain
D	mm
B	after the next three years maybe you will be able to do something
A	but now they've changed the law and we can't
C	yeah it's
A	we couldn't sign up you have to have been in England they just changed the law this year for three months
C	yeah
A	before you can sign up
C	yeah it's all because of the whole like
B	immigration
C	immigration thing
A	immigration yeah
D	yeah but then that's stupid anyway cos it's like erm
C	oh er
C	yeah
D	six months a year or something before you can even think about it
A	yeah
B	oh really?
D	so suddenly he finds out he can't take his benefits but
B	it's bullshit they couldn't do it
D	they can't
A	they can't
D	they physically can't do it
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	we tried and say to people when
D	yeah and even if they do wanna get the jobs they'll take their jobs and they don't pay tax but they do pay tax
B	yeah they can't they
D	cos that's an English jobs so the fact is
A	they have to pay tax yeah
B	they have to pay tax yeah I know
D	illegal immigrants and illegal immigrants aren't meant to be here anyway so
B	yeah exactly
D	that's already a crime and is against the law
A	that's the problem yeah we're trying to explain to people
B	that's what we
A	we are immigrants
D	mm
A	in a different country working
B	I said I worked in Korea
A	I er I'm an immigrant
D	mm
B	and I didn't spend my money in Korea I saved it and I've blown it all on an MA and my rent
D	mm
A	so all that money we saved in Korea
B	anyway
C	yeah
B	but that's exactly what people are doing
A	will actually be spent in England so
B	and they're like oh no it's different
D	yeah but they still pay tax on that one don't they?
A	people
B	yeah yeah exactly
A	with all this immigration but it's not every single country
C	yeah no no there's a huge
A	allows immigrants in to work
D	mm
C	yeah
A	every single country
C	of course they do
B	yeah it's ridiculous
A	so
B	they took our jobs
A	they took our jobs
C	it was just yeah it is it is completely ridiculous
A	mm
C	and I always feel bad as well people get so angry about er sort of Hollister you know like
D	mm
C	so Hollister's like I don't know if you know it's a really horrible high brand store but you go in and it's pretty much pitch black and they have spotlights on the clothing
C	everyone looks like they've just walked off a beach in Malibu like you don't you don't go for a job there you're like
B	headhunted?
A	headhunted
C	like headhunted so a woman would come up to you on the street and be like would you like to work for Hollister? and you're classified as like a model
B	yes
C	and this is how like Americans get round Hooters thing because technically it's illegal to hire people on looks but you're hiring a model and so that's how they
B	oh really?
C	negate it and that's how they do it in England with Hollister and there's a couple of other companies that do it as well and
B	yeah
A	mm
C	and people get mad at that and I'm like how could
D	yeah yeah
B	bad conditions
A	yeah they're working their ass off
C	and it's not their fault yeah they're working their ass off like they're offered all these opportunities and
A	quite often you speak to these people as well and they're all like I was a doctor in my country
D	mm
C	yeah right
A	and now I work at Aldi
B	yeah it's so
C	and it's like
A	I was a policeman and now I work at like Hollister or something
D	mm
C	and technically it's not even it's not their fault
B	they're people who are trying to make a fucking living there
C	the people who are
A	no can you imagine if somebody said
C	yeah
A	to you hey you can go and work in a shit job in that country

C	yeah I have to be
A	well my my space is
B	does it come to mind?
A	nice and organised like this
B	I need my space basically
A	papers around all that
C	yeah yeah it's like you
B	it's just when your mum brings up that desk we're gonna establish two separate rooms
A	yeah my room your room
B	to study in
C	it is a good thing to do cos you're like you're fine working at home cos
B	yeah
C	and stuff
B	yeah yeah he's the same I can't yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	I can't just I need silence just do it
A	I can only have instrumental music
B	I can see why
A	I can't have the lyrics if I have the lyrics it's really distracting but as long as it's just instrumental
B	if I
A	I can listen to it
C	well you have like music TV
C	yeah it's fine music TV oh well that's good
C	you have everything
A	I can't do that
C	I can't
A	I can't do that I've got to focus but music I can handle
B	I'm I'm kinda like you like even when we're working at our job at the university if there was some paperwork I haven't quite got done I've got to go back to it like early in the morning
A	oh she's done that before yeah
B	go
A	a little bit more efficient
B	you are a little bit more efficient
C	just more organised
B	yeah you you're pretty an extreme end of almost I'm gonna call you autistic
A	yeah I am a little bit too organised would anyone like some more wine?
B	don't don't don't crack
C	I'm okay I'm
B	no no it's a pretty good thing
A	no can look a bit anal
B	I don't know
C	no
B	disorganised people it's just
A	how did that how did that word get
B	fairly normal
A	er why does that mean organised?
B	what being anal?
A	anal
C	I don't know if it's
B	I think you're going through an anal stage
A	is it etymology? that
B	cos it's some must be attached to something psychological or a theory
C	yeah I guess so I don't know it's just something
B	is it keep it clean?
C	I don't know
C	keep it clean
A	yeah I don't know
C	just a note to add on
B	being a bit anal it's very precise it's a very
A	it's kind of anal
B	exact point in your body it's the anus
A	a very
B	yeah
A	a very
D	yeah
B	a very tight
B	hopefully
C	maybe that's why maybe that's where it comes from
B	like a saggy anus
A	saggy anus
B	oh
C	I don't know what that means
A	that's a good band name isn't it?
C	saggy anus
D	oh well
A	distended butthole
C	saggy anus
C	I do not remember that at all
D	I don't know
C	my memory is absolutely appalling though
B	mine's pretty atrocious actually
C	it really worries me
D	we're trying to figure out
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah it's yeah
A	she's already
C	yeah I think I'm I'm pretty on the way
B	it's pretty bad I'm sure when we're drinking it doesn't really help
C	definitely the drinking
D	and smoking
B	yeah
C	I just have
A	to dine young
C	yes
B	that's why I don't
A	you're gonna cheers
C	I'm definitely
B	I like kinda sort out one drink for another it's not really
D	oh well that's er one
B	stronger
C	to er to early dads
D	oh yeah definitely
B	yeah yeah you you two can
D	we're gonna live long
A	I've always dreamed I was dying at thirty-four I think it was
B	thirty-five you said
A	twenty twenty I
B	is that what you said?
A	that twenty twenty was gonna be the end of my life and it involves a plane so I've always said that since I've known you
B	which is why
A	cos that actually has become a thing just because I've saying it for years and I feel I can't remember the original premonition
C	I think I always thought that I was gonna I always hoped that if I was gonna die and er
A	oh
A	something cool
B	that's hilarious really?
D	I think to be honest I would dive on a hand grenade
C	I just thought
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
C	no that'd be amazing
D	like no
B	oh
C	no it'd definitely be like
A	my last line
C	what was it who was it was it Richard Feynman? when he died like he had the best like last words which was just like
D	oh yeah
C	dying is really quite boring
D	I'm I'm glad you only have to die it's really quite boring
B	is that on his grave?
A	I've always thought when
C	I hope so
A	I die I
C	mm
A	I just don't wanna die in a car crash you know what I mean? something that
C	I could do with that
A	it's really boring
B	I'd be really angry about that
D	can't think of the other guy whose last words were
B	yeah
D	went off and nicked loads of fence for the fire it was me and three guys that we didn't know and we
A	oh my god
D	and I had like a bruise on my neck it was
B	oh
D	but luckily I fell to the side
A	just missed it
D	I had like a bruise on my neck for ages
C	yeah it was really bad everyone thought I'd given you like a really violent hickey
D	I know
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	actual yeah
D	yeah
A	can I pause this for a second?
D	yeah
A	that's good oh okay erm
B	oh
A	yeah we were like let's go and fuck in that graveyard or something or whatever
B	no it was a park in Bath it wasn't a graveyard
A	was it? oh
B	it doesn't get classier than that
C	it was a beautiful park it was a beautiful park
A	we have done it in a graveyard erm
B	no we haven't
A	we have
B	wrong girlfriend
A	no we have
B	really?
B	anyway there's
A	anyway
D	so
B	yeah
B	no
A	you know when you climb over a fence and there's like you know the spikes on the top and then the fence bars getting over was fine
B	it was like a metal iron spiked fence
A	we were good
D	mm
A	after the job was done I was climbing back over my foot got stuck in between the two bars
B	we were drunk obviously
A	so as I jumped
D	mm
A	spikes went right up in one side of my thigh and it ended about here it was like really close to my balls
D	er
A	yeah it was like
B	he came away like we're never doing that again
A	I was I was pretty worried yeah
B	almost lost a testicle
C	who was that girl that erm er
D	when I was at uni wasn't it?
C	like on the road that we were living on the house that you came to
B	oh yeah
C	like obviously
B	would that classify as
C	yeah well it's that yeah that the wall opposite our house is
B	okay
C	so that was
B	oh
C	densely populated with
B	okay that makes sense
C	erm and they had like
A	some
C	four four massive iron gates
D	mm
C	like just along that one road it was ridiculous erm and they had similar kind of like iron spikes
A	yeah
C	and some girl had gone
D	dressed as smurf tried to climb one
C	dressed as a smurf gone out drinking went home and and obviously you have to go
B	did she die as a smurf?
C	no she didn't die but she climbed over and the thing impaled her leg
D	she fell and she was hanging on one leg
B	oh
A	oh
C	it went straight through her leg
D	yeah and then the ambulance turned up and then they had to call the fire brigade and chop the thing off
A	you hear about
D	she was hanging there until
B	oh
A	you hear about it going through here on people don't you? stuff like that
D	mm
A	I saw a guy
B	that's bad
A	turned out to be my arch-enemy in the end terrible cos he only had one ball lose a testicle
D	ah
A	at a football ground climbed the
C	oh
A	and he hung by his ball sack for about a second
D	mm
A	and then it ripped and I remember the the ref
A	running off afterwards with his ball in his hand like running off
D	mm
A	yeah it was pretty bad
D	do you remember
C	oh god
D	when he tried to pull
C	yeah that was trouble
D	tried to
B	oh
D	kind of
A	the skateboarder right?
D	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
D	he went into the bathroom I used to yeah we went into yeah the toilets and kind of
B	oh
C	oh oh
D	it was so bad cos at first when he'd done it everyone was like ah
D	and then actually that looked quite serious
C	it was so bad
B	shit as in
D	oh he was alright yeah
B	what the fuck happened to him? he was in
C	he yeah so he
D	he lives in
B	in
C	he teaches
B	oh is he teaching?
C	he's like head of physics
D	he's head of department ah
B	oh really?
A	get paid alright for a head of
B	oh really? oh shit man people have already got to heads of departments at our age?
C	yeah he did really well though
D	he got lucky
C	yeah like
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	he finished his PhD
A	some people get lucky don't they? it's just
C	he did an NQT
B	he was smart as well
C	yeah he was really smart
D	mm
C	and he did like an NQT then
D	mm
C	and then became head of physics in September
D	yeah he didn't quite leave or retire you see?
C	yeah he
D	he was the only other pure physicist there wasn't he?
C	yeah that was that was it a lot of schools like you
B	oh yeah yeah he was qualified for it
A	yeah filling that position
C	have people that take physics but don't actually know anything about physics they just
B	no
C	kinda stay year well
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	a a class probably ahead of the rest of them
A	who just do it
B	it's probably cos he's got undergrad in physics that qualifies him
C	kind of but he but he
D	but not many people went for it you see?
C	yeah well he said
B	yeah
C	no many people went to for it he also said that
B	oh really?
C	he set up erm they were teaching A level
D	where's my
B	oh yeah
C	oh it's just behind you he they weren't teaching A level physics at the school
D	yeah
C	so in his opposite that
D	oh cool
C	so in his first year erm post NQT he set up the A level physics
B	oh yeah yeah right that makes sense
C	like so
D	yeah
C	but yeah what he did he did his degree in like
D	astrophysics
C	astrophysics
B	ah
C	yeah
B	it's quite hard
A	the physics of astroturf
C	yeah
D	mm
C	I hope that's true
B	yeah
A	I thought I nearly died once
B	oh yeah
A	have you ever heard of a sea crate?
D	yeah
C	oh yeah
A	they're really pretty some of the most venomous snakes in the world apparently cos their pray can swim away really quickly so they have to you know
D	mm
A	get it down really quick and I've always heard you know
A	of being bitten and er we were swimming in Indonesia oh
B	no
A	and so I was out on my own and you know it was pretty cloudy
B	no I'm not very good in open water I get nervous
A	and
D	yeah
A	and its
D	yeah
A	so you're probably alright I got hit by something in the water swam back in came out and I had two teeth mark just here on my hand and I got
B	no that's not true
A	I think
B	I was worried as well obviously
A	I poured a bit of something out of it and I think what happened I think I got
D	mm
C	mm
A	I think it's two of the fin prongs like went in my hand but still when I looked at it it looked like a snake bite right in my hand and it fucking freaked me I thought that was it Indonesia dead
B	yeah
A	twenty-five
C	oh my god
A	end of me
C	yeah that would freak me out
A	but no I was okay it was about five minutes there when I thought
A	game over
C	I'm not gonna lie I would probably still be freaking out now
A	yeah
B	yeah he was a bit worried of himself
A	yeah yeah you got bitten by a dog didn't you?
B	not really
A	I thought I could've had it
D	well
B	was it a puppy
D	no it was when I was a postman
A	you were a postman?
B	oh shit yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah just a small dog that barked like
B	ah
C	that's so bad
D	so I pulled my trousers up and pulled my sock down but there was no teeth mark so
B	no it's just yeah
A	we er we've had a few problems with dogs and we quite often we like to hike in the middle of nowhere and we have to pick carry a stick or a rock or something like that only recently in er China a Tibetan mastiff went fucking crazy you know they're big fucking dogs
D	mm
C	mm
A	and they er obviously
B	yeah we clearly we were going to look at some like temple thing
A	and I'm like no no let's go
B	in China and there was it was clearly like the the
A	it wasn't clear
B	the tickets stand
A	there was like a whole
B	it automatically makes me think dogs
A	I thought that was a castle not for people
B	cos we've been in so many situations
C	yeah
B	now that we get chased away by fucking dogs so we walked in you were trying to get
A	I got a bit further away from
B	ahead of me thankfully
A	so when the dog came out freaking
B	so when this dog comes pounding out like
A	I had to run back
B	going mental
A	and I just had to block
B	he was just defending his property or whatever but
A	but you know how many times that happened to us
B	so many times
A	like very closely I could be mauled by a dog right now like and it's not a small dog
B	I think they're just defending their property
A	they're like big massive it's a big fucking dog
C	yeah
B	yeah that dog is massive
D	mm
B	yeah it's massive
A	it would kill me that fucking dog would kill me
B	but I've been to the point I got bit like that happened to us loads before then
A	yeah
B	and we just accepted they were just you know
A	that's when you got bitten
B	defending their property so yeah that's why I got bitten cos I didn't even
B	I didn't even turn around to look at the dog
D	yeah
A	just kind of yeah
B	that was behind us
A	that improved my Spanish didn't it?
D	mm
A	no this gotta go in your stomach and it's gonna be ten injections and this but actually some dusty old box somewhere they had the new vaccine it goes in your arm but every single hospital we went to didn't know that
B	yeah it was yeah
A	so in Spanish I had to communicate to them every time you know she's been bitten before we've already had two injections you do have the injection
D	mm
A	you need to look for it and this is what happened but it was pretty hard the first couple of times that we went to hospital
C	my god
B	mm the first hospital was horrible cos they were like you're gonna have to have the old school rabies injection which is like ten injections over ten days or twenty days in your stomach they're big and painful
A	you don't need all that
D	mm
B	and they're like you need
A	yeah no no
B	cos
D	mm
B	to see if it actually has rabies before they put you through the procedure
A	cos we were in the middle of nowhere so there's no dog
B	and then they did find this vaccination which was a massive relief but the instructions were in English so
A	I had to translate it into Spanish
B	like
C	yeah
A	so that they could administer it
B	translate everything into Spanish then you had to administrate the vaccination
A	and even then they didn't have the immunoglobuline and you're meant to have some extra
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about vaccination	Entailment
B	which is
A	injection that goes in the wound
D	yeah
B	I could've still got I could've definitely still got rabies even though I was having these
A	well I was worried as well because I had an open cut in my hand and I was cleaning her wound and stuff and I'd never had any injections or anything so I didn't really mention it cos obviously
D	mm
A	maybe I've got it or something cos
B	they can take it up to two years
A	yeah we didn't know that
B	it's the longest case of rabies
A	we were like if she's got rabies we're waiting until she shows some signs and
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure she got rabies or not	Neutral
D	mm
A	and then we're gonna get it sorted but then when we looked into it a bit more yeah once you start showing signs game over
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	you can't cure it it's
C	yeah you're right
A	you're gonna die
D	mm
B	yeah once it's penetrated you
A	did you have
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
C	they're allergic to water aren't they?
A	water yeah it's acrophobia
C	I mean it's just yeah
A	you die of thirst
B	when you have your body repels water
A	you die of thirst it is literally
B	they also attack your nervous system and everything else
A	a zombie disease
D	yeah
B	it must be a horribly painful death
A	horrible way to die yeah a lot of people in Peru die from it but not through dogs through bats
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about bats	Entailment
D	oh yeah
A	like they get vampire bats that are like flying
C	yeah I was gonna say they get a lot of
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about vampire bats	Neutral
A	yeah
A	would you guys like to go to Latin America? at all is it like on the on the list at some point?
C	yeah
D	yeah everywhere's on the list
A	I mean obviously some places more than others but
B	do you have any plans for the immediate future?
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	person B have plans for the immediate	Neutral
B	anything that's like attainable you know?
C	you know I think my my dream is
D	Ireland
B	anywhere in Europe? yeah
C	yeah we wanna go to Ireland
D	Ireland is
B	yeah I've never been to Ireland you have family there don't you?

D	yeah my granddad has lived for years and he knows a lot of them and
C	but literally
D	made his reputation in Ireland
C	yeah yeah
C	yeah yeah
B	he likes it yeah
C	like so we'd be drinking like beer and he'll have just like er a litre bottle of vodka
D	vodka
C	and he will have it in like a pint glass which
D	with just vodka
C	a pint of vodka and he will have like it he goes ah put some lemonade in there girl
C	but
C	and he would like literally like shandy it like will put like that much lemonade and
A	with a litre of vodka?
C	he won't eat like he doesn't eat
B	right
D	yeah he doesn't eat before he drinks
C	he thinks that eating is a waste of alcohol
D	is a waste of alcohol
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	so he will not eat and at the end of the night right
A	a true alcoholic yeah
C	who that's the other thing he always says he's like everyone thinks I'm an alcoholic he was like but the thing is is if you're an alcoholic you have a problem and he was I don't have a problem
B	I'm quite happy the way I am
D	he's like I only I'm only like this when I
C	yeah
D	but when
B	yeah
C	yeah he lived next door to him
C	so yeah so he's erm
B	yeah
C	he is yeah he's a huge drinker a massive massive drinker
A	mm
B	yeah
A	have you ever had one fifty-one at all? do you know that Baccardi one fifty-one?
C	no
A	it was one of my worst experiences recently was one fifty-one it's like seventy-eighty per cent liquour or something it's eighty per cent I'm pretty sure it's like Baccardi one fifty-one
B	though it's stronger
C	oh my god
A	but I was shooting it
B	Americans seem to know when they've got it
A	yeah I was shooting that and then chasing my shots with the whisky and it was bad
C	oh
A	like by the end of the night I was eating raw pork off the grill I wasn't eating cooking it properly I don't know how I got home the next day I thought I was gonna die and you were like cos it was one of the times you were really worried about me but
B	oh yeah
A	it's proper shaking like couldn't control the shakes and like
B	just had some beer
C	that's horrendous
A	but erm
B	the worst thing about it was that I cos yeah
A	I couldn't stop laughing could I?
B	me and
A	woke up in hysterics
B	me and
B	I'd go to bed that night and
A	and I'd never gone up
B	and our sink was having blockage problems anyway and I went into our little like it was probably a shower that size but the bath is smaller in Korea you just have like a shower hanging on the wall over the sink so the whole room is like a shower room
C	like a wet room
A	yeah
B	and the entire room was covered in this pink vomit where he'd thrown up in the sink
B	and I guess tried to wash it away but where the sink was blocked it'd like overflowed and then I heard him like stare in the bedroom and I was like
A	I was in hysterics
B	he was still drunk in bed
A	hammered completely hammered
B	laughing about the fact that he couldn't say the name of our partner which is difficult to say in Korean anyway to the taxi driver
A	oh to this day I don't know whether I walked home or I got a taxi but I know that my mate and it's a straight line it's a straight line that's it for about two or three K to get home but I've got this feeling that I got lost and I had to get in a taxi but the problem is in Korea saying your address isn't very easy and especially when like when you're sober so especially when you're drunk and our address was
A	so I don't know if I if it was a dream or if I actually was struggling in a taxi to get home like I don't remember
B	yeah right
A	but I got home I don't remember it at all
B	I was pissed that he was laughing away in bed
C	yeah
B	and I had all this puke to clean up
A	the laughing ended though and I was terribly terribly ill yeah
B	yeah yeah went about twenty minutes and
A	ill yeah
B	the shakes came on
A	terribly ill like I've been I'd had a lot to drink but this was bad
B	I don't know it's still not as ill as some people
A	that's the worst I've ever seen myself it was one of those times when you actually Google it the next day and you're like you can die from a terrible hangover
D	mm
B	it's an alcohol person
C	I I had a friend who woke up blind
A	oh my god
C	do you know
D	who's
C	my little
A	oh my god blind
C	erm
A	I take it that went away
C	yeah
D	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	like he wasn't a massive drinker anyway he would come and like drink and stuff but he would never go like too far and he got so so drunk like we just you know when you get to that point where you kind of almost think you're invincible? and he just I don't think he was just drinking it all I think like he must've done other things but he woke up and he was like I literally cannot see like he just couldn't see and it passed off like ten minutes or something
B	oh
A	scary
B	I would've been terrified
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	and literally
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	comes from
C	he said that it can actually like a severe case of alcohol would make you blind
A	a very strong alcohol
B	I just thought it was just bad alcohol that make you blind
A	have you heard about that in Asia like people have died a good few people have died from like
B	counterfeit alcohol
A	counterfeit alcohol basically
C	yeah it's common in Russia as well
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	obviously whisky
C	in erm
D	in what?
B	in Russia
A	yeah yeah
C	in Russia
A	we were worried when we were out and about so do you know what's going in this drink? no not really
C	no you don't I guess really
B	yeah yeah
D	oh
C	sorry
B	yeah it's
C	their biggest problem
A	well none of us has ever done it so it's not a problem
C	ah no no no we're fine the erm
A	ah
C	and would just like sip at it but obviously you're still like even if you're just sipping a tiny amount it's still a hundred per cent alcohol
C	so like
C	yeah they were just
B	so
C	like they would at least buy a lot of water like
A	yeah and water's not cheap so it makes it
C	water's not cheap you just whack up the price of water
A	yeah
C	it's like ten pounds a bottle and then that was kind of it
A	yeah that
B	yeah
C	but yeah it was er
B	don't drink from a tap
C	how do you find a way like
A	they always made the taps warm in those places did you ever notice that? every time we went in a night club
D	mm
A	the taps are hot so you can't like drink from the well I don't know a lot of people don't really like hot water so you go to like drink or like not saying I ever did but if I had friends that will take pills then er it's not easy with like a like a hot water tap or something
C	no
A	did you ever have Ossiana? is that a club around your way?
C	no there's one in
B	yeah
C	it's one night club here
A	it's like a
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	there's like a boudoir and like various rooms the ice house and there're all sorts of rooms a bit trippy when you're like quite mashed not that I'd know but er
B	continue
A	interesting place none the less
B	what was the point of that?
A	er hot water and
B	oh I guess there was hot water in there
A	and
C	yeah
A	that would be like freshen up for the ladies
C	freshen up freshen up
B	yeah yeah
C	I used to there used to be
D	calm down
C	one in the tap the woman who used to come and used to go to me like you
D	yeah they would always just
C	and all night that would just be in your head
A	freshen up
B	yeah yeah
C	she would be come up to me and I would go like this way
A	freshen up
C	but yeah it's erm I don't know
C	I don't know
D	it's cos I feel bad especially when I haven't got any money
C	I also feel bad but
B	I know yeah
D	that's a pound at least
A	I know
B	for the paper towel yeah yeah
C	how people can moan about like they're like two hour commute to work and then you think like you go home
D	yeah it could be worse at least you don't work in a toilet
C	and you tell people that you literally work in a toilet
D	yeah I know that's why I feel bad so I wanna give them money but
C	like you work in a toilet in a night club
D	I don't
C	you don't really see those any more though I've not seen one for a long time
A	when was the last time you were in a club?
B	yeah it really just depends where you go
C	yeah right I've not been to one I went to a casino
B	oh you did
D	when?
C	it was a filthy one in Manchester
B	oh really?
C	yeah it's really because

A	yeah
C	yeah I'm I'm a bit bad for that
B	what's what yeah yeah it's a casino it's fine isn't it?
C	it's just it's absolutely horrible it's so vile
D	the worst place in there is the toilet on the second floor
C	I don't think that there's a good place in there
D	because there's the roof the roof is like maybe here so you have to piss like that
B	oh my
B	that's terrible
D	and then there's obviously the guy at the end who is like you can't stand up straight so you and either crouch and try to piss but obviously the urinals are a certain height
B	yeah yeah yeah
B	you don't really wanna get down there
D	yes
D	it's just the worst place
B	yeah
B	they might keep it a bit cleaner in there cos people using it or something
D	yeah terrible place

D	mm
A	ended up getting drunk sleeping with some bird in a field and then being really happy that I'd just got laid that I walked on my foot like all way home got home had a look at it I was like fuck like two thirds of it were gone like after than night and it's never come back obviously
B	it's like having on the palm of your hand
C	it wouldn't be like yeah it's like
A	it looks like a hockey ball
C	you're it's like you
B	and it's always getting
C	it's like sweat
B	yeah
C	even if you manage to make it through like the healing process eventually it will just sweat out
B	yeah anyway it's just why they say that I think
A	I didn't realise as well that if you believe in like palmistry I don't know what the version is for your feet but like all different parts of your body connect to your feet and like you can massage this area and it will help you
C	oh
A	what was hard as well

C	I remember you said that you owned the violin
B	I know
C	it's erm
B	but then er I never played it
C	well let's see
D	it's time to try
B	I was gonna say I wanna learn how to play the violin but I like
D	it's incredibly difficult is the thing
B	I need I need I need lessons and stuff
D	it's not like a guitar at least if you just hit a random string of the guitar it sounds like a guitar
B	and I had plenty of opportunities to learn guitar but I
B	do you know how to I take it you know how to so we have spare string
A	I reckon like you fixed them all
C	oh
A	I don't know if it's just coming out
C	yeah see like you can see can you see the hole?
A	yeah
C	so you need to like it needs to be
B	the string
C	thread through that hole and then like
D	yeah I can't play nothing
A	but it's still still usable but then you can't like it's fucked
B	play the music of love
D	triangle
B	yeah I know
D	triangle I can play the whacking things
B	I play
B	is that what you mean? a whacking thing?
D	no I play the
B	oh right you've got a drum here that you can play
C	oh sorry
B	no this is this is what I can play so
D	oh yeah
D	that's pretty cool
B	that's pretty pointless I don't know does anyone make songs from
D	yeah it's not very versatile is it?
B	no
A	no no no
D	you can make funny noises of rain
A	you're not gonna play
B	does it even sound like rain though?
A	nah
B	it sounds like this beach the
D	sounds like bees inside a wooden tube
B	you know when all the when the waves
A	a
B	when the waves come in and that
D	mm
B	they must've bought it from the same shop I bought this
A	oh my god do they ID people nowadays?
D	yeah yeah
B	yeah take it although we haven't been IDed
D	yeah but the one time you don't take it
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it's depressing you isn't it?
B	yeah they know that I'm over twenty-five
D	mm
A	I'm definitely younger
B	it's kind of shit actually
A	I never liked Björk it's odd
B	I like Björk otherwise she wouldn't be up there?
D	it's funny as I keep every time I keep trying to call
B	ah yeah the picture with the fairies
D	you know the old
C	it's really like the worst version of
B	yeah
A	yeah I feel like she's licking my balls there
D	yeah
B	yeah
B	he just completely ruined it for me you wanker
A	just to clarify things to whoever is listening to the recording we're talking about balls like
A	yeah tennis balls
B	right Björk licking like hairy testicles
C	your testicles
A	licking my what?
B	your hairy testicles but yeah I kinda like that picture there
D	oh
B	he took the sexualisation too far
C	I'm trying to
B	can you fix it?
C	well actually
B	I think that you can
C	no
B	yeah okay
C	it's like
B	yeah
C	so
B	and we could watch you with
C	yeah it's just that
C	yeah yeah yeah that
D	mm
B	but you have to keep retuning it like a guitar when you first get it so yeah
D	mm
C	yeah the well it's it's a
B	even if it's a good instrument
C	we've erm
B	yeah
C	the
B	yeah I don't know how much he paid for it
C	you can do that because of the pegs
B	ah okay
C	because they're like the cheap ones tend to be plastic
B	oh okay yeah
C	and still they actually wood which is quite cool
B	ah yeah
C	but when you you might wanna just take it to
B	yeah
C	someone just to
B	yeah yeah just to get the
C	er and I mean it's more
B	they'll tune it up
C	yeah and they'll just like put it all in it will probably take like
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	so like the
B	oh which is
C	it's a
B	it's hard to do
C	it's really
D	you're blind as a bat
C	oh no it's not that
B	so it's getting more
C	it's because it's the erm
B	oh
D	let me have a look
C	really fiddy its right at the very back
D	oh god I can do it
B	get it in the
C	no he can do it so it
D	the string
B	don't you have your glasses
C	mm?
B	sorry I called you
C	so you like take it out
D	oh yeah yeah
C	so that needs to go all through there
B	oh
C	and then you twist it
D	through where sorry?
B	do you know what you I so do you
C	through that
D	oh yeah
B	do you need your glasses for
C	long distance
D	long distance
B	long distance so you're short-sighted
C	yeah
B	do you know what your eyes are in either side?
C	well I just
B	oh what is that?
C	I think it's one point five or point five
B	oh that's nice
C	or something like that
B	oh yeah they're quite small still
C	oh really?
B	three point seven five they're really really that's really bad
C	you wear contact lenses don't you?
B	but I got used
C	I'm
B	yours still feel stronger than that though I wonder if we just like
C	do you got your glasses you er
B	my contacts in yeah yeah
C	but that affects it
B	well no it should just gives me the
C	oh as if you were
B	normal sided yeah not more than anything
C	yeah
B	but usually I do it to people to see them I'm usually like oh like I put them on my nephews the other day and I was like he doesn't need to wear glasses like
C	no
B	you know when you were really like when I was wearing lenses my brothers
C	oh
B	don't make them cos
C	yeah it is like
D	oh what's this thing?
B	but yeah I wear lenses like
C	and they get worse if I've worn them all day
B	not to see people I don't usually
D	have you got a thin thing?
C	what's a thin thing?
D	well something that's thin enough to go in there and manipulate that wire
C	no er
D	something thin thin or thin
B	like a pair of tweezers or something more
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has completely healthy eyes.	Contradiction
D	yeah a pair of tweezers would be lovely
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D agrees.	Entailment
B	yeah I don't know if a pair of tweezers would work
C	you need erm
B	maybe I have something up there
D	oh
C	that's so strange I've never seen this before
D	what?
C	well normally these holes here
D	little
C	small yeah like fine tuning you do it with these bottom pegs
B	oh yeah
C	cos it's only got one for the eighth string you don't have one for the other strings but I've I'm not saying that is wrong I'm just saying that I haven't seen that before
B	oh but you've never seen that before oh that's so that could be it could be
C	no so mine have
B	yeah it's got one for each?
C	yeah so so you just can find
B	so you might find that these wooden pegs don't mean much
C	no not necessarily it might be that because
B	yeah
C	but plastic slip
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	are a lot easier so you
B	oh yeah
C	it's got the fine tuning eighth string so there must be a reason for it
B	something else
C	because someone's obviously tuned
D	yeah
C	or like string strung it stringed it I don't know
D	string strung it
B	oh that seems quite good though as it's level four I'd love to hear you play
C	oh no that is terrible
B	and next time I'm home next time I'm in
C	it's really it is so awful
B	I don't
C	no that's that's a good thing probably
B	yeah it's got no damp
C	it's a fucking shithole erm
B	I'm sure it's not a shithole
C	it really is I hate it
B	oh
C	the whole of downstairs for us is a complete write off
D	mm
B	ah
C	like I hate it it's so bad
B	where is the kitchen?
D	could you just hold
C	because it's that and often it's upstairs and through the top floor is fine
B	where is the kitchen then?
C	on the middle floor
B	oh is it? oh it's three floors
C	yeah
B	oh
C	so the downstairs is like
B	it's a massive house then
C	yeah it is but
D	well it's a panel house yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	yeah it's
C	awkwardly
D	awkwardly arranged
B	made out like
C	yeah and because
B	ah okay
C	it's kind of like a basement so it's really cold and
B	is that the ground floor?
D	yeah it's just just
B	where you no
C	yeah so if you come from the back
B	so it's the ground floor the first floor and then the third floor yeah
C	there's yeah second floor but like if you come from the back
B	second floor
C	then the first the ground floor is at ground level
B	ah okay
C	but if you're coming from the front the ground level is below
B	you go
C	yeah you have the front door there
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	well you go up and then you go into the middle floor
B	oh okay
C	it's a really weird layout
B	ah okay and you're on the your bedrooms
C	at the top
B	are at the top
C	both of the bedrooms you you you literally go to the top of the stairs one room there and one room there
B	oh okay
C	and then
D	is this just meant to slot in here yeah?
C	yeah you need to put it in that hole and then you can
C	yeah so you tight them
D	yeah yeah yeah
C	does that make sense?
D	oh
B	oh okay that's nice
C	and then
B	yeah a conservatory
D	an indoor out house
C	then you've got the bathroom and then you've got
B	what floors are the bathrooms on?
C	on the ground floor
B	ah on the ground floor and
C	and then we've got like another what would probably be so I think in a lot of houses that tends to be all of the houses are on the road if you look down into that that room it's just like a free for all room
B	ah
C	like people tend to use it as like studies or gyms
D	some people have them set up as their kitchen
C	some people have them set up as
B	oh okay
C	a weird the house is just a really odd layout like
B	yeah
C	like it's really really strange and a complete pain in the ass because if you need the bathroom you've got to go up two flight of stairs
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
C	it isn't
B	yeah you don't get out of bed
C	no it's freezing
B	how's been living with
C	yeah
B	a third person is it fine?
C	yeah it's fine
B	yeah?
C	I guess cos we've always lived we've always been together so we've always lived other people so
B	most of the time you've lived with other people apart from that year when you lived in
C	yeah apart from that one year
B	yeah me and
C	it is not
B	in Korea not so much
C	so bad I don't mind
B	I think we've considered it if there's someone that we could
C	well this is why we were saying my my thing that worries I really wanna buy a house
B	yeah
C	I really really wanna buy a house
B	why?
C	why? cos I just I I wanna have a house
B	I mean it's stability like it's an investment so I understand why
C	yeah it's like
B	I don't really wanna hear about
C	well it's not
B	yeah yeah it is
C	yeah
B	and whatever you know he's twenty-eight he's crossed that line he's not gonna worry for the rest of his life
C	no and like his family are obviously well off and stuff so and
B	yeah yeah I feel maybe they weren't cos he didn't seem
D	mm
B	not like whatever but they definitely are like his eldest brother is a really successful lawyer and he's other brother's successful as well like
C	yeah
B	he's got his looking chemistry shit and
C	I mean
B	stuff like so yeah it is his mortgage but you know anyone can sign it anyone can get the
C	it's erm
D	yeah I know it's fiddy but I I almost had it
C	no you have to twist it round hold it and this is why I'm saying it's quite hard
D	if you actually twist it it falls out because you can't hold it while it's being twisted
D	unless you just take
D	not really
C	no
B	or is just
C	like my
B	it's always been your teacher
C	for me
B	yeah
C	because the thing is that's the other thing with violin strings is like if you they are quite sturdy but because they're a lot thinner the guitar strings if you there's a very kind of fine line and then it'll just
D	well
C	oh sorry
D	don't tell me that if there's a chance I'll up
C	yeah no
B	oh no it's alright
C	I guess they're like
D	we're not
B	the first time I tried to
D	sturdy or
B	yeah I was not worried
C	yeah it will just it will just
B	oh
C	there's
D	it is
A	oh sorry is that a problem?
D	no it's alright I'll drink anything
A	it was the only thing they had like a massive bottle of Max something like that and that was it that's all they had
C	yeah no that's fine
D	cool
B	something
C	that's fine
A	sorry I did carry
D	it's alright it's fizzy
B	sorry I didn't want to
B	well that's
A	no that's fair bring it up but I er
B	oh I thought this was a
A	it was like double the price for a non Diet Coke so that was
C	that's okay
B	do you want sugar? do you want me to put sugar in it?
D	really?
A	well they only had two bottles of that I'm not entirely sure but it looks as if
D	more caffeine
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I looked for I looked for something cos the Max one didn't have any sugar either I was like what's this low fat?
B	oh no yeah yeah
D	bullshit thank you very much
A	sorry mate
D	that's alright it's still fizzy
A	that one's definitely got caffeine in it
D	yeah
A	actually the other one didn't so
D	that's good
C	strict caffeine
D	no calories
D	no I was fiddling with the violin but then
C	no just
B	just as
A	yeah
D	no
B	do you mind if I have a Kronenbourg?
A	no of course I don't I spoke in Spanish that guy again in the shop I'm gonna speak to him every time I see him
B	ah yeah he works with his wife what's he doing behind that?
A	he's lived here for five years he told me in Spanish
B	ah he's working in
A	yeah
B	it's like fifty or something he can't be doing too well
A	no
B	but he's happy is he?
A	yeah he seems friendly
B	oh has he oh is it?
A	yeah yeah oh
B	mm I know it is is that where he's from then?
A	yeah he's from Spain
B	from Barcelona?
A	actually he's from Spain
B	yeah
B	and that's also from er
A	come on in or
B	and that's not from er not from Argentina or Brazil
A	no
B	they fuck you up man
A	do you speak in Spanish
C	no I can't speak any Spanish
D	me a couple of words
A	how racist
C	yeah it's pretty
D	yeah
D	well I learn how to talk to a black man
C	I don't yeah
D	the looky looky men
A	what do you know in Spanish then
D	mm hello
A	that didn't sound like Spanish
C	yeah that wasn't Spanish
D	yeah well
A	it's just
A	yeah
A	it is funny when you hear the British accent they're all like
D	oh
C	yeah
D	mm
A	we make a T and a D here but they make the
D	mm
A	the tap they say like D D kind of like the American water water
C	oh yeah
A	Spanish do that
D	that's what
C	mm
D	mm
A	how long you can make that name?
D	mm
A	fuck off
A	we say American words all the time now it's terrible
D	yeah it's easy
A	I say candy
D	candy
A	I say
D	candy
A	I say vacation instead of holiday
C	oh that's naughty
A	but it's kinda I feel the lexical gap
C	that's terrible
A	it has a lexical gap there because like for us now vacation is when you have a break from work holiday is like Christmas or something like that
D	mm
C	yeah
A	so there is a difference
D	mm
A	I don't use them interchangeably
C	yeah yeah I guess so
D	but we
C	it was on holiday
D	on holiday yeah holiday
A	holiday yeah
C	but then you have like a festive season
D	yeah
C	that would be like Christmas or Easter
D	it's festive time
C	everyone's on that festive break
D	what do they call it in America? holiday season?
A	you there fetch my turkey
B	yeah it's a holiday season they can't if
D	holiday season
B	they because as well they're like
A	they actually prefer Thanksgiving
B	Halloween is a typical holiday
A	to Christmas I would say
D	mm
B	Thanksgiving is a big holiday and then they have Christmas so from the end of October
D	oh it sounds like if they can't eat the fucking roast dinner then
A	oh mate
D	you're a fucking idiot
B	yeah I know exactly
D	oh cheers if you can't eat your roast dinner you ain't gonna enjoy it though
B	they still do have they do do it differently though a little bit they'll have roast turkey or deep fry turkey you understand
D	mm
B	and erm they have this like info commercials that's what they call them
D	oh you
B	every year around Thanksgiving about how to safely deep fry your turkey because you can't obviously do it in a
D	deep fry
B	they do it on
A	oh it's juicy apparently
B	they do it in like drums like oil fig metal drums
A	to deep fry the whole thing
B	in their yards and they like fill it up with oil and there're things like info commercials about how to do it safely cos every year people set the fucking fire alarm
D	then why why
C	why do they wanna deep fry turkey?
B	because it makes it more
A	oh it's very juicy yeah
B	it's a better flavour
D	well eat eat chicken instead of turkey
C	well but it's like like
B	yeah exactly
D	that's why people have chicken over turkey cos it's more
C	they say like
D	moist
B	they do they are they are like far for Thanksgiving
B	no no no their Thanksgiving is
A	they do like turducken
C	oh I know I don't like
B	they do turkey
A	have you ever heard of turduckens?
C	turducken?
A	do you know that?
B	oh yeah
A	it's a turkey
B	stuffed with a duck
D	stuffed with a duck oh
A	stuffed with a chicken
D	oh
B	chicken with bacon
D	oh with bacon
A	apparently apparently British invented it
B	yeah
C	oh really?
A	it was invented here first yeah well we invented
B	well we
D	we invented roast everything
B	I know basically got to roast it
A	yeah forget the tandoori oven and that kind of thing just
B	roast they have they have like
D	we were the roasters
B	they have mashed potatoes something different Americans do not really roast potatoes they don't do roast potatoes
A	no they don't roast potatoes
D	they don't roast

D	what is the blandest thing on the menu?
B	yeah yeah
D	it's quite funny
B	but it's not like compared to I mean American cooking wasn't any better when we were there
A	yeah and we went to some of their restaurants we went to a Greek restaurant
B	in fact I think we were really disappointed
A	and had
D	the only reason Americans have better food is because they're a nation of immigrants
B	that's almost
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah they have it's like
D	so the English went there and took it over and then the Italians came and went actually you know you can eat pasta and pizza and all this good shit fuck it we'll have that oh we've got coffee as well
A	but we're gonna call it gravy
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
D	then
A	yeah now it's gravy I never really get that
D	that's the only reason the cooking is better
B	the gravy
A	spaghetti with gravy
B	no
A	no they don't in Italy but in America it's
B	American Italians are different species
A	spaghetti with meat sauce
C	lots of them I find it a strange concept with like erm
D	isn't gravy something different in America then?
C	and there're are like identities
B	well yeah well yeah they have this
D	well I don't just mean like
A	sorry I grabbed your arm
B	yeah so they have something they like
A	they have biscuits on gravy
B	yeah yeah one of our friends said biscuits and gravy is amazing
A	do you like biscuits and gravy? you know what?
B	biscuits are very similar to scones
A	scons they're the same as scones
B	but instead of being made with
A	butter they're made with lard
B	butter milk so basically it's good
D	oh sounds good
B	it's almost exactly the same as the plain scoens so bread
A	so they have it with a like a buttery-like sauce like a white sauce
B	no I don't know it's like a sausage
A	with beef with sausage
B	sausage meat gravy
A	chunks in it
B	it's like a white
A	it's a white gravy
B	it's a white
D	but they have the scones
B	that they have it on bread with bacon it's fine it's good
A	so if you hear biscuits and gravy
D	yeah
A	they then mean a soggy biscuit
C	wow
A	that you really make
B	with bread and gravy yeah so gravy there is different
A	do you wanna try it
B	yeah
C	no
D	no?
C	no
B	but the word gravy is more generic
D	so yeah they're not it's something like you put in food
C	oh oh yeah
B	there's something called pasta noodles that they call lasagne sheets they're then
A	yeah they're noodles
B	they generalise and call them all noodles
D	I call them chips
C	they're noodles?
B	yeah they're noodles
A	yeah they're noodles
C	oh
B	they're like where's my er
D	in the food world
B	they do have a slight like our our most of the people that came from
A	yeah of course it's pretty varied
D	yeah well even
B	some of them yeah
D	he didn't like the way Americans are
B	mm
D	cos he was quite erm
C	yeah cos this is the thing it's Americans
D	he seemed to be more British in his manners but he was more reserved
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
D	rather than loud mouthed and abrassive and
C	oh yeah see there's a lot of
B	yeah yeah
A	our friends think we're more European than British our American friends don't think we're
D	really?
A	yeah she actually said that to her
B	she actually lived in England for a year and she didn't like she didn't I mean
D	where did she live?
A	generally I think that because yeah
B	probably somewhere in London
D	yeah in London yeah if you live in a big city
B	yeah yeah I know
A	I think cos we're fairly warm and like friendly at least a little bit when we meet people they don't think we're English
B	no I don't think that's the problem
A	we don't have we don't have the best reputation abroad we don't
B	no I mean in Europe we have a horrible reputation
D	yeah it's cos we're the drunks in Europe aren't we?
B	yeah yeah exactly
C	yeah
A	however in Korea they all think we're James Bond
B	yeah yeah yeah in Korea
D	yeah
A	seriously
B	in Korea their
A	gentleman
A	oh yeah
B	a gentleman with his top
D	so they're like a hundred years behind
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah they love
C	oh
A	we
B	ah you're British ah gentleman that's all your taxi driver knows
A	and you're like there you go
D	mm
B	how to say in English is gentleman
C	no
B	but I mean Americans I mean
D	well I mean a lot of Americans out there so yeah they get the military
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	and there a lot of problems
A	yeah there are a lot
D	mm
B	a lot of problems
A	not where we lived but in
B	yeah it's terrible we just got like you know a twenty year old had just been like recruited from really shitty places in America and then you get
D	no yeah
B	stationed in Korea to go and get pissed
A	and then they don't give a shit about the culture whatsoever
B	they are not doing anything there
D	mm
B	we've met some of them and they're like we're not doing anything yeah this is like easy easy times for us
A	mm easy money
B	as long as we're out on the weekends we can do whatever we want it's just
A	yeah you probably missed that they have
D	mm
A	they're a bit of an embarrassment
D	well it's cos they've been sent there haven't they? they have no interest
B	I don't blame them
D	if you've got no interest in going somewhere and then you get sent and you're made to go there
A	yeah
D	you're not gonna care are you?
B	just waiting for recruiting
A	I can't blame them I just do my best to stay away from them
B	they have to do the military they don't like that
D	mm
A	that's all
B	yeah we
A	we never did that the only time in
D	mm
A	ever ever ever
B	yeah
A	I mean just people don't lock their doors they don't like
B	some of them do but yeah I realised that
A	I mean if you go to
D	mm
A	and that feels a bit like maybe if I could kick off here or something like that but in the rest of Korea
B	especially when we were in the south
A	anything
B	it's really safe
A	no violence no thefts maybe you can lose you bicycle or something but
B	yeah people with bicycles stolen from time to time
A	there's nothing you don't hear about people getting raped or nothing like that it doesn't
C	god
B	occasionally but
A	yeah but
B	compared to every other country in the world
A	it's ridiculously safe
B	that we've been in like I've stumbled out of places at five AM just stumbled around
A	mm
B	completely hammered and
B	churches
C	mm
A	there're like coffee shop coffee shop coffee shop
B	on every street

B	and then a coffee shop on top of that
A	so it's three coffee shops on top of each other

A	yeah
C	so Freaks and Geeks was
A	yeah I know
C	it's like an American TV show
C	erm
B	yeah
C	and Freaks and Geeks is like an American TV show it used to be like
A	I've heard of it yeah
B	yeah I've heard of that
C	early two thousands late nineties
A	do you have it written down?
B	yeah I've definitely heard of it
A	do they continue with that?
C	and it's got like er
A	er
C	James Franco
B	terrible wasn't it? yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	might be a little bit
C	imagine the comment and it was
D	I'm just gonna call a rollie really fat
C	This is the End did you watch This is the End?
D	I'll write it down if you want I think
A	yeah alright
D	I think I've written it before but
C	the thing is like
B	no no okay
D	yeah basically all the
C	it's got er who's is it er who's the
A	yeah all of it
C	some the really tall guy
D	a hundred and twenty-seven hours
C	yeah yeah
D	with James Franco
C	yeah yeah yeah that's what I said and like
D	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it was good
C	it was a good film
B	yeah it was alright I mean
A	well it's a good story not a good film
D	mm
B	yeah
C	it's like if you watch a hundred and twenty-seven hours backwards it's actually a beautiful story about a one-armed man who reforms his arm
C	and it's like slinking through the desert
A	yeah
C	I was like I need to watch that kilm backwards erm
A	you into much horror? do you like the American Horror Story or?
C	I watched American
D	yeah it was shite
C	I really loved it it was so good
B	second season was the best one
A	first series I thought it was a bit shit
C	second series
A	but the second one was better by the end
D	it was shit
C	I really loved the first series
B	yeah
C	the second series is the insight
A	I didn't like the first one
C	it's the insight so it's really weak
B	yeah yeah it's better
A	yeah I liked that one
C	I didn't like that
B	oh really?
A	we preferred it
C	because I thought the actual
B	oh the acting and stuff was much better in the second series
C	yeah I guess but it's like
A	the story was better
C	Jessica Lange is Jessica Lange anyway
B	yeah Jessica Lange was awesome yeah
C	but like
D	could you pass me that?
C	concept like
B	oh yeah
C	you have a nineteen fifties American asylum like you they could literally be
D	thank you
B	they said that they were
C	not doing anything but it's not but I guess it's not even from like a
B	yeah
C	so they didn't even have to do half of the stuff that they did because your mind always fills in the gaps for you and then
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah put monsters in the woods and aliens come down
C	yeah monsters in the woods you
B	you've got aliens and stuff
A	oh is that what
B	I feel like it's kinda ridiculous
D	they should've left it they left it as it was but the patient psychosis do you know what I mean?
C	yeah that was so
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	but when
A	no it was it was too much but
D	yeah
A	some of the things I like I liked
B	I don't think it was too much
A	but I just thought that it was better than the first one
B	yeah
A	and then the third one I thought shit
C	I never watched the third one
B	the
A	with
C	and then now they're doing the freak show
B	it was
B	there's like teenage witches that is really really quite
A	ever heard of that?
B	I don't know
C	no
D	we were on a mission when we trying to find horror movies that were actually good
C	yeah we always have
A	I know there are very few
D	unless you go Asian
A	did you see that on?
C	what?
B	er what one is that?
B	The Conjuring?
C	The Conjuring
B	is where they move into a house and the house is
A	have you seen oh yeah
C	oh and then there's a man
B	the man out of the window
C	and he's like in the back of oh wait no is that is that the one where they're like
D	is The Conjuring the one where at the beginning they're hanging themselves?
B	no no that's
A	no that's Sinister
C	oh okay
D	oh Sinister
A	did you like that
C	who is in that Sinister? because I think Sinister
A	it starts off and there's a black and white video like four people on a tree and then you see a little thing come out and it starts cutting the tree branch
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	and they all like they all start getting hung and
D	mm mm
B	yeah
A	they find out later it's the children doing it
C	but I thought no
D	mm
A	I thought that was quite freaky that one
C	yeah but no is that I thought
B	or is that
A	that's Sinister that's Sinister
C	oh I think it is oh I know I'm thinking of Insidious
D	what's the one with the really crap
B	no Insiduous is that the one in Mars?
A	yeah yeah
C	oh no no that is so bad then you can imagine they were like fuck fuck
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
C	we were filming in like ten minutes and we completely ruined the
D	fuck where's the
B	no no no
A	it was it was a comedy I thought it was a comedy
B	yeah it was terrible it wasn't that terrible but it was so
A	I thought Sinister was generally a bit scary I didn't like it
B	it was so scary
A	it had lots of weird sound effects you know that they were
D	the sounds were good
B	I couldn't watch it again
A	the what do you call them? the sunbeds sun loungers and they were all like hanging there
C	mm yeah yeah yeah and
B	yeah
A	and like then they're going aorund with the lawn mower and it's like going over their head
D	mm
A	I just thought it was creepy I thought it was creepy
C	I think there's something about
D	yeah because basically the problem with American horrors is that they show too much
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	when you see the monster it should be
A	yeah that
A	that is yeah
D	no The Thing The Thing is the best horror film ever
A	that's the problem
B	yeah yeah
A	with Japanese porn
D	that you don't see enough
C	you don't see enough
A	they show too much
C	oh they show too much
B	you don't need to see the heels
A	once you hear Two Girls One Cup you don't need to know anymore
D	mm
A	you know? we know what's coming
C	yeah
B	I don't even know where they come from
C	I have no idea
D	but yeah I think
A	have you seen it?
C	yeah
D	the first one
C	you've seen One Man One Cup
D	what?
C	yeah you need to
D	oh
C	yeah
D	I don't know what she might've
C	that was so bad
B	she didn't tell you beforehand
C	no she was like
A	no I I would've left the room
C	have you but she was like have you see Two Girls One Cup?
A	what happens?
D	it's basically a guy shoves a vase or something up his arse and then it smashes
C	and I was like yeah
D	and then it smashes
C	it's like a glass bottle
B	oh
D	in his arse
C	and then and then it just shatters but the thing is is
D	horrible
C	the camera is obviously on the floor so
D	oh
C	like his legs are kind of akin but you can't see like above here you can obviously see the bottom disappearing
D	his arse
C	and then you see it shutter and you just the worst thing is you just see his
A	that's gonna fuck you up proper
B	what's that thing that
C	yeah I mean he probably
D	yeah yeah
B	was it in
B	oh no it was on a TV series Sons and Anarchy
A	Jesus Christ
B	there's a thing where someone got died or something stuck up their ass
A	oh I told you about that
C	oh was that real?
A	that happened in England recently
B	oh right
A	it was terrible some guy
D	oh yeah I've heard of it yeah
A	yeah it was like a few weeks ago
C	ah right like he like fell on something on
D	yeah
A	he went septic and he died and then they're posting it on national news
D	mm
A	so this poor sod died because he was too embarrassed to go to the and now everyone knows that
C	and now
D	yeah everyone knows about it yeah
A	yeah it's pretty hard
B	the thing the sad thing was the do you remember when we went to Croydon with
A	Croyde
B	Croyde
A	been there
A	the problem is it might be true
C	really?
B	and a bottle of ketchup was stuck up his ass
A	there was something in a video about
C	it's just really unfortunate that my tousers and my pants manage to
D	I think I've heard
D	on
D	they never
B	they can't confuse it with
D	why'd he put a condom on it was he gonna use it again later or
B	oh
A	oh god
B	yeah blatantly he's preserving his ketchup preserving his
C	yeah he needs to really
C	like the pressure like pop the lid or something and just like have ketchup spread
D	uhh ahh
B	no just don't put
D	yeah
C	yeah
D	there're facilities if you wanna stuck something up your ass you can buy say milk
A	yeah
D	to go in that orifice
A	just
D	if if you don't if you don't wanna go in a sex shop you can
B	yeah exactly
C	do you remember in
D	oh yeah
C	and there was a guy so it's a silver screen we used to sell like Softcore porn like those Debbie Does Dallas and stuff like that and there was a guy that used to come in
C	and used to order like this Softcore porn and he you can even if I didn't know who he was you would've guaranteed that this was the guy who was gonna buy the Softcore porn because he would come in in this like long black trench coat in like a fucking bowler hat and like the biggest sunglasses like with his collar up like
B	oh
C	it was so so bad and erm and he used to come over to the counter and be like
B	yeah
C	and then just like
D	hide them amongst his
C	hide them amongst er I actually can't order it but
B	yeah yeah it doesn't matter
D	I don't think
C	and literally he was trying to say yeah like I couldn't give a shit like it's fine he was like
A	do what you want just don't do it here
C	yeah
A	oh god
C	he used to come in and he always used to buy
A	nothing worse than a big boil
C	Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen films from like when they were kids like
A	oh god
C	really young and it was the worst thing I refused to serve him I was like I can't I can't condone this he might have kids at home he might've just bought it for his children but I've watched too many films to know that that guy is not normal
B	yeah I know
A	no he's not normal
C	I know but he just told me everything that I need to know
B	yeah I know that boil is never good yeah
A	even on simple fairly traditional terms I mean SandM and like gimp costumes they
C	just
A	thing
A	but does anyone find SandM and and
C	I don't
A	I mean maybe the guys that attend it but
C	really have
D	no
A	I don't know but
A	is there anything about that leather black suit that turns you on?
C	no because

C	the thing is is maybe if I was like size six and have like this amazing figure maybe if I put a
A	yeah
C	or maybe like actually you know what
D	yeah you look hot and I take it off
C	I can't and I'd just look like Peter Griffin
B	yeah
C	it's just a fucking mess like
D	Peter Griffin

D	yeah
B	it's better in the summer
[ANNOTATION]	they cannot wear shorts if they work as a postman	Contradiction
D	yeah erm no I didn't consider it cos obviously I was back at college and it was you know nine o'clock to eleven ten
B	yeah yeah
D	and you can't be a postman at that time so
B	oh yeah shit you can't be like a night policeman
C	mm
D	no you can go on and sort and stuff but

[ANNOTATION]	speaker a doesn't like working at nighttime	Entailment
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	fucking
A	you just have the whole day
D	yeah you think about
C	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they all agree	Entailment
B	yeah
D	yeah
A	it looms

A	like pasta
D	yeah pasta or pizza
A	is he a good cook
C	yeah
D	I can do some
A	what's your specialities?
D	mm pasta
C	I don't know
D	yeah
A	there you go for when we come and visit
C	and
D	I can make a curry
B	ah
C	I do make like well I try and make lots of things that I can't
D	mm
B	yeah yeah
D	without me cos I fuck it up
C	but yeah
D	you whinge at me for not cooking but then if I make something I'll fuck it up when I whinge over wasting food so I'd rather whinge over not cooking cos then
C	it's no it's he he
B	I always whinge over everything
A	no you don't
C	saying things like how do you do this? but with really ridiculous things so I
A	a pot noodle
C	was cooking and I asked him to cut the lettuce and he literally was like how do you cut this?
D	well I was yeah I was what do you want it cut like?
B	oh do you want it in strips in big bits?
C	it's like lettuce
D	yeah
C	no
A	it's a legitimate question
D	yeah
C	you cut lettuce that's it
A	just cut it
C	if it's too big just rip it smaller it's fine
B	yeah that's true I know what you're saying
D	but then if you just said oh just small chunks I could cut it up that straight away otherwise I was cutting you went ah
C	but you always seem to
C	the thing is I'm not very good cos I'm just I like to just have the kitchen to myself and I can't stand it if people
B	yeah yeah
C	are like just in my way
D	you say that but then you when you
C	yeah I know
D	thanks for the help
C	I do that
D	yeah
B	yeah
C	it's not mine to ask you
D	no it's multi tasking
A	I've got a good sous-chef
B	yeah
A	she's a really good sous-chef
B	yeah I do what you want me to do eh? you trained me well
C	no that is good
B	to be
A	you like to get that done don't you?
C	yeah I'm just not very good
A	I just know the level of
B	he likes to control
B	you like things being set
C	no I think I just like
A	but I've heard that
C	to know
B	who's the bossy?
A	was she bossy when she was younger?
C	no
A	well I've heard that you were quite bossy when you were young
C	I wouldn't say that you were the bossy one
B	yeah
C	out of us
B	definitely
C	no I think
C	yeah
B	that's shit or fuck that
C	yeah she would just tell you what it is
B	I'm not doing that
C	yeah I'm like really indecisive
B	she's like endearing mm
C	I'm incredibly indecisive
A	so is
C	yeah I think
B	yeah
C	you're not too like assertive but you're not as indecisive as I am so you
B	the kids
A	oh
C	I'm not a cow
A	yeah yeah
C	erm or a goat goats can also be
D	or a goat
C	milked erm yeah no I think you kinda
B	so you can
C	entertain my
B	yeah
C	but then you're quite like
B	yeah what are we doing here? what are we all doing?
A	yeah
C	calling me fucking indecisive
A	you're a lot more indecisive than me
B	yeah
C	I'm really indecisive my I think my indecisiveness comes out from like I don't wanna make a decision that other people won't
B	that
A	no you no yeah and there's couples who do that
C	so yeah like
B	yeah yeah
A	all the time like back and forth like what do you want? I wanna go where you want it's like
B	I just well I don't actually care that much
C	yeah what do you wanna do?
B	so if someone does care then that's fine for me
C	yeah
C	ah see
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah exactly that is very typical
D	yeah we got a washing machine after a while
A	I I hate that even more
B	have you got a dishwasher?
A	I hate dishwashers
D	yeah dishwashers that's it
A	because you end up doing it twice
C	no but it's
D	yeah
A	you the problem with the dishwasher is
A	you end up doing it twice you wash the dishes to put them in the dishwasher
D	yeah but you you you
B	yeah
A	to then stick it to then unstack it and then put it in
B	no you don't have to you don't have to
A	it seems like more work to me which is why we end up washing up
D	no yeah no you can't expect like make sure it's clean as well
A	I don't want one
B	no
D	I can't agree with him when you start using it it works out
C	you need to get on the cooking
D	cheaper as well that's the only reason cos we had it when we first moved out
A	a washing machine is cheaper than just doing it
B	dishwasher
D	yeah
A	a dishwasher? it's still a washing machine
C	it's a washing machine but
B	oh yes but we call it washing machine or washing machine
D	mm
A	it's a dishwashing machine
C	yeah
B	it's a silly name isn't it? the washing machine
C	when we living in
D	cos I said that they they do need a freezer then they started using it and their bills
C	broke down yeah it really broke down
B	yeah
C	but we're fucked anyway now cos we're on a meter
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	mm mm
A	no no we don't even know what's going on with that water
B	no we
A	it still doesn't get through to it
D	mm
A	then I mentioned it to a plumber and they were like
B	but when we went outside and checked and she was like she doesn't think that we are and we are just we are five on five
A	I'm like
C	really?
B	I don't think that they can put some more water
D	mm
A	yeah there's five in this one building
C	that's whom you said
A	one two three four five
B	two three four five yeah
C	is it the one in the roof?
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	and they must be quiet big as they've got the whole big
B	it is a double fronted house it's not like
A	yeah so
C	oh yeah no no no I get the four
A	what we've got
C	but I I think like
B	and there's one upstairs too
A	but actually this flat
C	they must have like a
A	got the raw deal because the two bottom ones get a garden
B	no only this one gets the garden
A	no
B	oh they get
A	they got can't you see the garden outside?
B	oh they get
A	yeah that's the other part that's the other garden so the two bottom ones get a garden we get the little balcony and a little bit more space
C	mm
A	cos here we've got the extra space but theirs they're missing this alleyway bit and they're missing the balcony
B	cos they're
C	but would they not just be
A	so it must be quite small
B	they haven't got this extension
C	reverse?
A	they've got yes they do
B	oh they do oh yeah yeah yeah
A	if you look out of the window you can see there's another window
B	oh yeah it's quite small
C	so wouldn't theirs just be the reverse to yours?
A	but we just have the
B	yeah they wouldn't have that section yeah yeah
A	cos we get the balcony so they're missing about that width
C	oh
A	a lot
B	yeah bedroom
A	so theirs is smaller than our apartment basically they'll be missing that strip from the front door width to the balcony
C	but then the people downstairs are probably paying like an extra fifty quid a month for that
A	probably
B	yeah cos they have the maybe
A	mm and to tell you honestly this is enough of a garden for us
B	but
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a does not live in a flat	Contradiction
D	mm
A	we have a nice big window the sun comes in
B	the garden is right next to the kitchen with our plants
A	I feel like it's this is our balcony that's our garden in there yeah but if we were in here I couldn't sit out there and smoke I'd feel really conscious of people
D	mm
A	looking down on me
D	mm
A	for like whatever that is
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is a garderner	Neutral
B	I mean we wouldn't
D	yeah when we had a garden in
C	yeah yeah you don't you never used it
D	cos half of the time is winter and when
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	half of the time it's shitty English weather so
B	and it's
D	yeah
C	yeah
B	when it's raining I just don't
D	but I mean it's nice in the summer but the by the time summer rolls around cos you left it cos
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they think the English weather is the best	Contradiction
B	it just grows over the summer
C	cos it's like
A	and this is perfect because we feel like we're sitting outside but if it rains
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a sits outside when it rains	Contradiction
A	you don't get wet
C	you've got the window yeah
B	yeah it's cos it's got sash windows there if they were normal windows they only open a little bit don't they?
A	mm
C	mm
A	they're a bit noisy though and they're not very good in the winter
B	and they're not very good in the winter
C	yeah that's true
D	no you need to put some of the
A	yeah
C	it's gonna terrible like that yeah
A	to be honest I think I mean we
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c is always cold at home	Neutral
B	we just put a blanket
A	we lived in Korea with no heating and it gets down to minus ten pretty consistently there like we it was see your breath in your house
B	minus twenty
A	it got up to minus twenty yeah
B	that one year yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a has never been to the asian continent	Contradiction
A	yeah about to minus twenty but like I mean it doesn't get below about minus ten in England does it? I don't think ever maybe minus seven or
D	yeah
B	it's usually in the it's still usually like
C	yeah it's
B	but your dad made
D	yeah
C	the worst has been like minus ten
B	of saying England is a much damper cold
A	it is yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	and that makes a bit different
A	but damp at two degrees it's probably the same as minus ten degrees in
B	it's not necessarily the cold it's the way the cold feels
A	yeah
B	and I can tell even today's been like like a cooler day
A	mm
B	I mean there's a dampness to the air that Korea doesn't have
A	they don't need another temperature chart cos they're always like ah it's twenty-five but feels like seventeen
D	mm
A	because of the wind well it's not twenty-five then is it?
C	it's seventeen
A	so and it's like yeah it's minus ten but you know it actually feels like two or something well that's not the real temperature then is it?
C	yeah
A	tells us what it feels like not what it is but feels like something else
B	yeah
D	mm
C	it's probably strange
B	but yeah
A	it is cold but so we we lived a couple of winter seeing our breath and we just thought we would always have a duvet around we sat on the sofa with the duvet
D	mm
B	we did have access to heating but we just didn't wanna pay for it
A	it's too expensive
D	mm
A	I didn't wanna pay for it
D	mm
A	like if it's us
B	I mean the storage heating stays the same so
C	you don't have to turn the heating on
A	come on we're twenty-eight
C	they're pretty good
D	mm
A	we don't have to live with a jumper on
B	I don't know
C	yeah if you
A	are they good storages?
C	yeah I think storage heating's meant to be quite good aren't they?
B	they're meant to be economical like you put
C	yeah
B	them on at night when the electricity is on a cheaper tariff and then it's meant to store the heat
C	yeah
B	for half of the rest of the day
A	but who wants the heating on at night?
B	well it keeps it
A	the only time you the only time you want the heating on
C	yeah it just stays it's like a big cylinder block and you just turn it on
B	yeah yeah when you're cold
A	yeah yeah like a brick or something
B	I'm sure if you turn it on at anytime of the day
D	mm
A	I'm sure the only time you really want heating is when you wake up in the morning
C	mm
D	yeah
A	and then
D	when you go to sleep
A	probably when you go to bed like an hour or two before you go to bed
D	mm
A	once you're in bed you're fine you don't need the heating on
D	mm
C	no
A	but like that bit when you get into bed is freezing cold or whatever
B	it's nice to have it at that time the central heating but
C	yeah
B	obviously that
A	but this thing if you put that on at night you'll be good in the morning but come the evening it's not gonna work it's gonna be like
A	run out
C	yeah they are
B	yeah
A	honey you live with me we're not gonna use it
B	there's there's only two of them in
A	get used to that
B	there's one in here and one in the bedroom so the rest of the areas are no mans land but we're hoping in fact we have property at both sides of us
A	so hopefully that
B	and below and above us
C	yeah you they aren't any good
B	so that will be
C	oh yeah
D	with the tops and heat rises
B	no no it's not that it's not true
D	walls
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
D	it's not just
B	and we have got these big windows so it's more chilly really
C	I mean you're yeah but if you you can get like what's like that ceiling stuff that we buy?
B	yeah yeah
A	mm
C	it's like usually like a big
A	do you get discounts?
C	yeah like thirteen per cent
B	woh
A	nice
D	twenty per cent some weekends
C	it's on weekends
B	stay with him
C	yeah I know I thought
A	he's the one
D	I'm trying to leave her
B	he's even better than you
A	I found us a job right here we didn't have to do anything no interview nothing
A	god I'm chain smoking tonight it's terrible
D	mm
A	I do like your bag
C	oh thank you
A	where did you get it from?
C	it's very big you know what? my nan bought it for me
A	oh lovely
C	yeah my bag was breaking and so she bought me a bag in like near where she lives
D	she got you a matching belt
C	well she
A	oh you got she got a nice matching belt?
C	yeah
A	that looks a bit like crocodiles skin or something
C	I think I think it's just kind of erm what would you call it? like
D	plastic
C	plasticy like fake leathery looking stuff isn't it?
A	that's lovely very nice colour
C	it's very blue isn't it? like a smurf colour
A	yes definitely or Avatar
C	or Avatar
A	did you like that film?
C	hated it
A	yeah I didn't like it either
D	it was shite
C	it was just like
A	what was the best film that you've seen recently?
D	the best film erm
C	mm
D	yeah that was good Rush
A	what is Rush?
D	it's like er
C	it's a like a Ron Howard film
D	er yeah
C	about erm the Formula One racing driver James Hunt and
D	James Hunt and Niki Lauda
A	oh
C	Niki Lauda they have like a big rivalry going on like in the sixties and seventies
D	seventy-six
C	was it seventies? and then
D	seventy Grand Prix
B	yeah
D	seventy-six Grand Prix
C	erm it's all yeah it's just it's all based on kind of like they're working up their
D	into formula one
C	to formula one
D	formula three to formula one and then what happened when they finally got it
C	erm yeah
A	Rush
D	yeah
C	yeah it's really good
A	was it good?
D	yeah definitely
A	do you like like
C	I don't like formula one at all I have no interest in that
B	yeah
D	but then you like
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I rarely watch movies that I think that was really good
B	we even saw oh sorry I
A	but I really liked erm the last movie that I thought and it's terribly stereotypical cos it's fucking Tarantino but I thought Django Unchained was really good
C	yeah Django is really
A	and
D	anything Tarantino makes it is fucking
B	I know it is stereotypical
D	especially the Basterds what's his name?
C	Christopher Waltz
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah he's
A	I really liked Inglorious Basterds
D	Christopher Waltz is he Chritopher Waltz is he the
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah the nazi who's coming for his
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
D	he's just too good just he can speak three languages well and act
A	yeah
D	like a beast
A	he's he's also in Inglorious Basterds isn't he?
B	which is why the film is like
A	he's the guy like when they're underneath the
C	he's the dentist
D	he says I can't speak any more French why don't we speak in English?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah he's fucking good yeah he's really good
D	yeah he's fucking amazing
B	he's
A	I like any Tarantino
B	well that is a good fucking film
A	pretty much
C	yeah I mean
D	mm
B	it's hard to find anything else
A	because I need in a film I need
D	mm
A	dialogue and I need good fucking dialogue so
D	mm
A	when I watch all
D	mm
A	it's the plain truth I don't like it
C	yeah no I think
B	that's the odd thing that we'll like it for what it is
A	I need good dialogue
B	or if we're on the right mood we'll
A	we quite like Snowpiercer only because er did you see that one?
D	no
B	yeah it's a shame it's really
A	erm kind of sci-fi movie about
D	mm
A	but it has some Korean actors in it and it came out in Korea
B	it was really big in Korea
A	about six months before it came out in England strangely even though it was like
B	I liked the dialogue yeah
A	decent dialogue and an interesting
D	mm
A	ever make a good the problem for me is the whole format I don't think you can tell a story in an hour and a half particularly but I never like short
B	and there'll be an extent of two hours and forty minutes
A	I
B	but if it's the wrong film it's like
A	mm I like
C	yeah
A	and I never liked short stories cos I just felt like you couldn't really get it out and I feel the same about movies I love series but movies are just a bit shallow for me I don't feel like you can really get enough in it whereas like Tarantino's movies are usually two to three hours and it gets more out
D	mm
B	I guess it's just appreciating different forms and
C	yeah it's got more dialogue
A	yeah and that's what I like basically anything with a lot of dialogue I'm usually
D	that's what Tarantino's good at talking
B	they don't necessarily
C	yeah he's like
D	he can make two people talking wicked
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah
B	really good yeah yeah
D	like the French guy and the nazi
A	yeah yeah yeah
D	they're just talking
A	yeah
D	but then they go through three languages what they're saying is wicked
A	yeah
D	and this like little stupid
A	as it's a clear
D	jokes and like
B	the dialogue yeah
D	he's like
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah ridiculous fun
A	I don't need Transformers or you know the science fiction ones or anything like that
C	yeah yeah
D	or even Transformers would've been good cos obviously I I was born in the eighties and like I watched Transformers it would've been good if it was about Transformers but it's not it's about these moronic people wandering around when this transformer's in the background
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	doing shit you can't make out you gotta squint and what's that? oh it's just looks like a metal mush of CGI shite
B	yeah yeah it hurts your eyes
A	er no it gives me a headache when I can't watch it
D	yeah it's cos it's just shit going on and
A	and we normally go in a bit drunk so it's kinda like
D	if it just makes what a transformer's not human just make transformers
C	yeah it's true
B	but we
A	we quite liked that Matthew McConaughey Leonardo DiCaprio movie
B	which means some of the movies we criticised maybe it was because
A	what was that
D	Wolf of Wallstreet Wolf of Wallstreet
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah but then that was er er er
B	Scorsese yeah exactly
C	Scorsese
D	Scorsese yeah Scorsese
A	that was alright again yeah
D	it can't go wrong
A	yeah again
C	yeah never seen a bad film
B	yeah yeah yeah that was funny actually
D	even er The Departed
A	erm The Departed was good
B	cos in Korea like er films like were
D	yeah have you see that er Infernal
A	no
B	but obviously some big Hollywood films would come to Korea
D	it's the Asian version the original
A	ahh it's good it's good
B	and they'll get loads of like er there must've been about news
D	I I think
A	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	and they did that with Wolf of Wallstreet we went to watch it at the cinema
C	ahh
B	it's not very common with this type of films
A	oh it's terrible
B	because of the subtitles and stuff unless it's really publicised and I think Wolf of Wallstreet must've been really publicised cos the cinema was full
A	it was so embarrassing kind of
B	and that opening scene where he's sniffing a line of cocaine
B	from a hooker's ass
C	ass mm
A	yeah
B	or blowing it into her ass whatever was going on and we were in and like Korea's like er America where if it's eighteen is not really eighteen that you have to watch it with your parents so there were families there there were old couples there
A	nobody was laughing
B	they were all going to watch a film that obviously has been mispublicised in America cos there were
A	they don't do drugs
B	in that opening scene
C	oh
B	and of
A	it may be a bit awkward for us to like
B	I just sat there like like what are you doing?
A	mm
B	what are you saying to your child right now about what's going on here? what are your subtitles saying?
C	that's so
A	that that scene on the quay was just like
B	cos this is nothing to do with
A	in the quay yeah
C	it must be quite er
B	it's really disconnected and then you come to the end of it
D	it's trying to like
B	and there's like a blonde
A	and then I knew I fucking knew that there's no way you're gonna
C	yeah that's why
B	yeah
A	it was terrible yeah the whole
B	oh yeah yeah yeah
A	the two
B	he obviously got home fine but no that scene the best one is when he's on the phone and they're like trying to drag each other

D	yeah
B	not but he was good in Titanic
A	I liked I liked Titanic I liked him in Titanic but I didn't like him at the time I thought he was a little boring
B	yeah that's because you
D	cos he was just a boy that was it
[ANNOTATION]	person D is not sure that he is boy or not	Entailment
B	yeah but that's because you were both teenagers

C	and inspiring
A	what did you think of the The Grindhouse movies?
C	I quite liked them I thought they were good
D	yeah they were alright
A	did you know any other Grindhouse movies? well I'm obviously quite into movies so
C	yeah but I'm not really into like I'm not hugely into B movies
B	yeah
C	like my B movies kind of extend to like Roger Corman and that's kind of the limit of my knowledge Roger Corman was like this really famous B movie kind of director in the
C	B movies off the back of successful films so like
D	it's crazy
C	Jaws came out he did Piranha he kinda started that trend
B	I don't know how it is sometimes cos sometimes I can't even
D	mm mm
C	erm but you had like Roger Corman film school
B	give me some alcohol let me see
C	and it's not necessarily an establishment
B	these rollies you can't do any cigarettes cigarettes
D	mm
C	it was more kind of like the terminology and because what he was really good at was taking kids out of film school like recent graduates and letting them direct his films
A	yeah
C	because they were really really really really cheap
A	oh okay
C	erm and actors as well but the people that came out of film school and he let direct his films were like Martin Scorsese Francis Ford Coppola
C	erm and ended up going like he pretty much kick-started Jack
D	oh right
C	he ended up taking all these people for really like self erm money making reasons erm but kick-started the career of like some of like
A	the whole bunch of people
C	the greatest directors ever
B	have you have you
C	mm yeah
B	did you read it obviously yeah you
C	yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah
A	have you seen
B	I've only read it recently and I'm like
A	but it's
B	I've found it really hard because the entire time they're talking
C	yeah because you just
B	a lot of the read head guy which is Jack Nicholson
C	yeah
B	and I picture Jack Nicholson the entire tim does the movie end in the same way as the book? cos I can't remember the ending and I don't know how just
C	how does the film the film ends with electrick shock right?
B	yeah he
C	ohh
B	cos he's not the same guy anymore
C	right no he doesn't
B	whereas I don't remember the film I doubt the film
A	did you ever see a French Swiss movie called Man Bites Dog?
C	oh I know that film but I've never seen it
B	no
A	that was quite a good movie it was like the
D	no
B	it sounds really dark
A	yeah it's pretty dark it's like a Swiss erm film
C	mm
A	you know arty kind of movies it was like a Swiss film crew follow this postal killer that goes around and he he the killer's like very you know kind of charismatic and like he's talking like to the the camera and stuff but he basically goes round and steals from old women and rapes them and stuff and like it's pretty graphic and stuff and he eventually goes on and he kills the film crew like the the that's in it but it's quite a dark movie I remember liking that when
B	yeah
A	I was younger I like kinda international films and stuff and that was definitely one I liked I really liked erm
C	oh yeah City of God is a classic
B	yeah
D	mm
A	yeah when I was growing up that was such a good movie
C	I never really liked City of Men though
D	no it wasn't as good it wasn't as good
A	I never saw it that was a sequel
B	ah yeah I never saw it either
A	was there a series or something?
C	there was like a TV series
D	yeah I think yeah
C	but I don't know if that and they did the documentary as well
A	have you heard
B	they tried to make an American Peep Show
C	yeah yeah
A	have you heard oh the remaking of Breaking Bad?
C	no they did like the
A	did you like Breaking Bad?
B	yeah but they did the Mexican version
A	no the remaking is called Metathesis it's in Spanish
B	yeah with Mexican characters
C	ohh
A	it's for
B	it's
C	really?
A	same story same characters same everything
B	it's really bizarre
A	google it have a look and the the trailer for it is exactly the same but with different people
C	that's so weird
B	they just like we can captilise it it's gonna work really work then
D	mm
A	it's the same thing but it's called Metástasis
B	the Spanish community
A	it's called Metástasis which is Spanish for cancer I guess so maybe it was
C	god that's really odd
D	mm
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I'm quite excited about it because I like to speaking Spanish and I kinda wanna brush up on it
B	so maybe the story
C	the story
A	and I like and I like Breaking Bad so I've got some of
D	cos there're some Mexicans in Breaking Bad aren't they?
A	exactly
B	yeah yeah exactly
D	cos they they're going over the boarder so when they go when the boarder bit comes in
B	they even have some senior
A	but the
B	I know
D	yeah
C	yeah yeah I was gonna say they can they can like
D	cos that was a big part of it that they can't tell wasn't it?
B	the
C	no it's cos they don't speak much in Portuguese
A	no they could
B	yeah they could go into Guatemala or something like that
A	no the cartel would be like Guatemala
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	mm
A	do you know what I mean? they could in Mexico and they're going to Guatemala or so but
B	or El Salvador or something yeah that's true
A	that was pretty sketchy when we were there we went to some pretty like
D	mm
A	it's meant to be one of the like the worst gang countries there
B	oh El Salvador is actually quite friendly
A	free lifts all over the place in the whole region but I mean
B	free
D	mm
A	definitely in that region in Central America
B	Guatemala was the the
A	I had a guy on the bus lived in
A	and I'm like alright cool I don't know why you're doing that but that's fine we had a big black woman throw
B	we'd be like
A	stands at us and like rocks at us and like shouting at us and shit
B	it wasn't just at us it was like at everyone
A	she was just crazy I don't know
B	that was that was in Honduras
A	she was definitely shouting at us she was shouting at us
B	that was in Honduras
A	I had another guy on the coast of Honduras I went to step on like a wooden jetty you know what I mean? like
D	mm
A	where a boat is or something
C	mm
A	it looked really shabby went to step on it a guy comes out with a shotgun and he's like pointing it at me
B	no that's just for the patrons at this tower
A	telling me in Spanish like you've gotta get the fuck off that thing and that was basically like you're gonna shoot me if I stand on this wooden jetty you know?
B	but he was in that it was a dodgy part of the coastline so anyone staying in that hotel probably wanted gun protection
A	there were a lot of like military police with like big machine guns
B	bakeries were armed
A	on the back of cars and stuff yeah people protecting bakeries with machine guns with like it it was crazy
C	oh my god good pasty though I would kill for the pasty
B	yeah yeah I know I know exactly
A	yeah
B	the worst one
A	mm
B	because the local buses there're gangs and stuff
A	I mean the crime rate Guatemala city has like
D	mm
A	I didn't know that before
B	but no we knew we weren't meant to go on this bus but we knew like we got off the city bus like a city
A	inter city bus
B	inter city bus that arrived
A	take a local bus
B	to get to the next bus to get out of the city
A	it was so gangster it was like run by gangsters
B	this the bus was the bus had been blacked out
A	the bus was like all painted black and like
B	inside with like
A	it's all like gangster music and shit
B	gangster music and the guys running the bus were all fucking gangsters armed and shit and they were just like you know
A	I was like well this bus is crazy
B	imagine being on a red London bus but completely gangster
C	but did you get on this bus?
B	no yeah yeah we got on the bus
A	yeah we rode in it for a while
B	thankfully some other guy
A	they were really friendly this guy helped us
D	mm
B	yeah
A	he took us off the bus and took us to the other bus stop where we had to wait there at the bus stop
B	he was with a he was with the bus that we arrived with someone's got on and then he got off he got off with us and got us on the next bus
A	but everything in your Lonely Planet so do not take local transport
D	mm
A	before he popped on to whatever bus but I mean
A	yeah
D	mm
A	and we thought that we were gonna travel like normal people we were not
B	but it's because like it's because mugging and like gang crime is so high that you
A	we were told that there are loads of Americans we met were like Guatemala man it's the fucking place
D	mm
A	it's the Indo-Euro of Central America you know you've gotta go to Guatemala
B	Guatemala yeah
A	and we actually had our worst time in Guatemala didn't we?
B	yeah well I think Americans were
A	beautiful country loads of amazing places but like so many Americans that've come from here they're not travelling in our eyes properly they're not taking local transport
D	mm
A	they're taking tourist buses they're not staying in the local places they're staying in one guest house everyone together
B	they're staying in like the local kind of hostels
D	mm
A	so like we basically we discovered it at the end of our trip we were quite poor we were probably getting a bit cabin fever we were trying to quit smoking we argued a bit like as it was getting on at this point
D	mm
A	and it was like we wanted to meet people but we didn't have enough money to stay at the expensive tourist place so we were staying with all the local people there's no foreigners anywhere
D	mm
A	and then they're telling us this place is really cool and like I got into arguments with the local people cos they were real fucking arseholes I found the local people there
B	they were just really trying to rape you
A	to be
D	mm
A	real assholes compared to
B	and then we found them
A	Mexico
B	you're gonna get mugged yeah
D	mm
A	and for a while we kinda followed it and
B	you need to pay for this you need to pay for that you need to pay this
A	and were like okay in the end it was just like fuck it you know I'm here I wanna walk around
D	mm
A	I'm sure it's fine I speak enough Spanish we'll be careful we won't take any shit with us and this one time we hiked and what really pissed us off in Latin America they charge for everything and
B	no Latin America in general the south
A	Central sorry South was better Central was like you wanna hike up this beautiful mountain? okay I'll pay a little price but they'll charge you like twenty dollars or something and it's only like two dollars for a meal so twenty dollars is a lot of fucking money
D	mm
A	and like I think we paid like five to ten dollars this time no the first time we didn't pay and there's about half way point or a third of the way up you could go and there's this cross and you get a beautiful view of the lake and you're already like four thousand metres or something you're very very high up and we didn't pay and we scrabbled up this really dangerous like cliff I suppose it was we managed to get up there and we
B	rather than taking the path we just went up
A	we didn't pay so we just kinda took our own route and it was really skecthy
B	and I was like nodding that
A	kinda said right we won't do that again but we wanna go right to the top
D	mm
C	yeah
A	so we'll do this again and we'll pay so we paid it's about a three four-hour hike up to the top we get to the top and there's this guy up there and he's like ah hi
D	mm
A	and the guy was like no no no you paid this village but you need to pay my village you've got to pay here
B	and we lived back there like the other side
D	mm
A	and we lived on the other side of the town you've got to pay us and it's the same price again another ten dollars per person or something and I was like no I'm not gonna pay so we kinda walked on he followed us and he was like he started pulling out his phone he started ringing people he's like I'm calling my friends you have to pay this money we're not letting you down effectively until you pay this fucking money and he got to this point where there was a very thin path and he blocked he came in between
B	no no
A	he just had this machete in his hand
B	I was quite cheap really
C	yeah that's a real bargain
A	well I just no I just I didn't wanna give him a lot but I had some cash in my pocket so I kinda
B	yeah yeah
A	and he went to grab it and I managed to do an exchange
D	mm
B	and I don't think
A	and we just ran down the mountain
D	mm
A	we didn't I don't think he'd've stabbed us or anything
B	yeah I thought like he was
A	he wanted to rob us
B	there's a lot of there's a lot of
C	mm
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and they get really quite envious of that so they try to get money from them
A	we understand we understand
B	but
A	mm
B	these numerous places but no one fucking does
C	yeah
B	cos they wanna stay with all the other fucking tourists
A	yeah
D	mm
A	the problem with Central America is the prices were really bumped up because Americans didn't give a shit about how much things cost they don't know
D	mm
A	that it's only two dollars for a meal
B	we stayed like
A	so they don't care that the bus is twelve dollars
D	mm
A	I mean twelve dollars doesn't sound like a lot of money but actually the bus is only two dollars
D	mm
A	but they're ripping you off like mad because they know that most people don't give a shit but for us
C	yeah
D	yeah
A	it was like we just started living
B	we just
A	like a local and using local money you can't and pay
D	mm
A	so twelve dollars on this
D	mm
A	three-hour bus is kinda ridiculous so we had a real problem there didn't we? we
B	yeah
A	and we had a really nice time I don't think it was us
B	Mexico was much better
A	I think it was
B	no it was only Guatemala that really tested
A	it was but Americans love the place
B	Honduras is
C	yeah
A	they're like it's a real place it's Guatemala so
C	I can imagine that kind of just happens or it doesn't you know a few
D	yeah like
C	yeah it's like
D	Cancun
C	we were er a friend of us erm goes to America quite a lot and hires like he'll fly over to like Chicago or New York or whatever
D	New York Chicago
C	and just hires a car and then just drives like he loves driving so he'll just drive across
B	oh America's
C	America to the other side
B	a place to do that
C	yeah so a real beautiful er concept so he did like route sixty-six obviously cos that's the route that you have to do erm and he did it the first time and he said it was like
A	archetypal
C	really really surreal because it is so touristy
A	yeah
C	like so touristy that you'll be driving and you won't see anything for like an hour and then all of a sudden there'll just be a run of fucking shop with like I love America t-shirts everywhere and like American flags and it's just like tourist central and then you just drive past it and then there's just nothing again
A	I can believe that yeah
B	yeah yeah
C	like so he was then
B	cos it's pretty random it's like desolate and then
A	mm
C	it's really random but he was saying like route sixty-six is actually cos he was saying we said about doing this as well like
D	yeah we were gonna go from New York to
C	to San Francisco and then like go to Vegas
B	yeah
A	well that's a journey fucking hell
D	yeah but you wanna go across the country
C	it's like two thousand
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	two thousand miles from there
D	you're gonna
B	you can do it
C	yeah like the thing it'd be quite fun and this place is like I really wanna go to Oklahoma and stuff but
B	yeah yeah
C	it's
D	I wanna meet you in St
A	have you ever heard of the Pacific crest trail? I think that's you guys should go there
B	I think that's
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	erm we've got some friends there and told us some crazy stuff actually we met there's er this one guy he's from Iran he just hiked the Pacific crest trail which basically is from
D	mm
A	California to Canada he walked and he took six months
B	it's a mountain trail
C	yeah
A	to follow the mountain trail and you you preorganised drops in post offices for food and stuff and then he hicked for six
B	it's a fairly small boat did it
C	mm
A	sailed down the coast of America we just missed him in El Salvador we were gonna meet up with him but we couldn't after El Salvador he sailed across the Pacific so they sailed
B	yeah
A	to New Zealand they sailed from Latin America
B	it was a fucking small boat as well man
A	to New Zealand which took about three months and then they stayed in New Zealand for a month and a half a year and a half and they've just left and now they're sailing back across the Pacific how insane is that?
C	that's ridiculous
A	people that are literally
B	yeah
A	him and his two brothers and there's some little boat that they did up
C	that sounds like my worst nightmare
A	sailed across the Pacific
B	no yeah yeah yeah never
C	I would never do that
B	no no no
A	a part of that makes us kinda wanna do something insane like that
B	insane yeah yeah
A	but you know I mean I'm like I wanna kayak around the coast of Africa or something
B	or cross the Amazon yeah
C	yeah I totally yeah
C	yeah
B	he didn't tell me what wasn't he gonna
D	yeah oh
A	ohh
B	did he cycle to Thailand?
C	yeah he did it in two years
B	you got me out of that blog
A	woh anyway
B	when we went back last time or something
B	and then he got the
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	oh a weird one cos kinda
C	erm he yeah
A	cos he
C	yeah he was talking about going through like
A	and there's some big old mountain passes like
D	yeah
C	kinda Syria and they're going straight from Syria
B	no yeah you have to
C	into Morocco so you can't do that like
D	mm
C	I watched a TV show about this and they said profusely that you can't do that
D	but then it all did it all kick off wouldn't it started to kick off as well like Siria and those places
A	we're considering
C	and then when he talked no he
A	we're considering teaching in Irak there're some jobs there
D	mm
D	got a friend who works there one of my best friends
C	he worked to yeah
B	yeah
D	he's an electrician and was in the army
B	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	yeah yeah
D	to get in
C	yeah
D	yeah he's cos obviously he had to fucking spend his money on that
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	and then and your good wage
B	that's exactly what our friend
D	mm mm
C	that's probably why
B	and he's earning hundreds of thousands
A	yeah I mean
D	yeah if you were
B	yeah yeah and they pay you a lot to be out there
D	I mean the American
B	oh really?
D	but cos he's English he stays in an English place mostly
C	yeah there's nothing
D	and obviously they've got nothing
A	yeah
D	they've got a cup of tea
A	a canteen
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah a canteen where they bacon butties
D	so they say like people
B	if you're lucky
A	if if if you go to the Middle East I mean we will be earning about two K maybe two and a half Ks so that's twenty-five grand a year or something but you can apparently save eighty per cent of what you earn there
B	so you're not they pay for your accommodation
A	so you can save like fifteen hundred pounds
B	you're not spending money on
A	sixteen hundred pounds a month
C	no but
A	but
C	yeah you can't like you can't buy alcohol
D	there's a lot of restrictions
A	yeah you can't smoke
C	you can't drink out there
B	yeah
A	you can't smoke you can't drink
B	it depends on the country
A	no yeah you may
B	in the Middle East
A	erm
B	some countries you can get
C	Dubai Bahrain
A	Dubai Bahrain they're a little bit more liberal
B	in some countries you can get a foreigner permit and you can
C	but then
A	but the problem you're gonna go to the Middle East
C	yeah
B	Saudi
A	this is why
C	but then still we're talking about getting a a permit to buy alcohol you're not gonna be like out drinking every Friday
A	no no
B	oh of course not no no but that's fine that might do us a favour actually
A	but we know that we need to calm down
C	so it's gonna be yeah but that's what I mean like you're gonna save
B	yeah yeah
C	shits loads of money on that
A	but that
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	that's really we're not particularly traditional that's the main reason that we're getting engaged really it was we were talking before and like we we've spoken
B	sorry I've got it
D	no no it's fine
A	we've spoken about marriage quite a bit and
C	mm
A	this time it actually got to the point where we were talking about practicalities of marriage
D	mm
C	mm
A	who would come where we'd do it how much it would cost when we'd do it and at this point I kind of thought that's really not very romantic is it? like we're just gonna get married but this so I kinda thought I should propose do something at least a bit romantic while we're travelling and then if we have a really shit cheap wedding it doesn't really matter for us cos we're gonna get married anyway
C	no no no yeah
A	that's why I proposed I mean
B	yeah yeah it was a surprise there wasn't any reason to propose
A	obviously
B	yeah they have good jobs in Kazakhstan
A	then we will probably get married next April or May
B	I don't think we have enough experience for the good jobs in Kazakhstan
C	it might be like a good if you know it might be a good thing just to do and like go away
B	just yeah yeah yeah
C	if you're like engaged and in your minds you're married anyway like
B	for us
C	it might be a good thing just to do because then
A	yeah
B	for us that we're abroad all the time it's always better to be like married
A	how much more married can you get? we have joint bank accounts
D	mm
A	we live together every day
C	yeah
A	we've lived together for nine years
C	and then there's
B	yeah I know
A	we lived abroad
C	it's like me and
A	you guys are married
D	mm
B	do you have anything in England it's like a legal
D	yeah tax breaks cos David Cameron's er
C	you get tax breaks if you're married
D	bollock things
A	but do you get any kind of recognition for being
B	but do you get anything like cos in Canada and in
C	no
B	in Canada I know for sure that
A	it's over seven years
B	if you've been together for over seven years then you're legally a partnership
D	oh right
C	yeah you we're considered
D	there's similar things but we don't get our tax breaks or anything like that
C	yeah you don't get tax breaks if I there're certain things like if
A	uh watch out
B	yeah
C	yeah
B	oh she wants your DVDs
A	she wants your DVDs
A	it's a multi game now
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	so if I die under suspicious circumstances erm but apart from that and I don't even know how it would work I think as well like because we've lived in like shared houses and we haven't necessarily been registered as those houses like I don't know if in terms of like
B	if it counts legally
C	legal like we might actually be
A	yeah
B	if you can
A	be able to
C	be two years or something that
A	yeah
C	I don't know
A	we we find a joke that in an Islamic country the fact that we've been together for nine years counts for nothing
D	mm
C	mm
A	but if we got married if we are married for a month
B	a Christian marriage
A	with a Christian marriage that apparently holds some weight but
C	yeah it is it's just how it is it's to like keep the church going
D	it's more like
A	we've been this
B	yeah and it's
A	we've been so pragmatic about marriage that you might not even change your name because it's only forty pounds to get married it's a hundred pounds to change your passport so like
C	yeah
A	change your passport and I'd feel bad as well because we're kinda like collecting stamps in our passports and suddenly you have this brand new passport and nothing's in there
C	eventually you'll have to get a new passport
B	anyway
A	we already have yeah we got through our first one and like we had to get a new one
B	we bought a bumper one acutally that's quite big
A	we had we got like a bumper one and like a bigger one
C	oh
A	what's the joke though is that we finished our passports early and we didn't quite finish it there was a few pages left but quite often they stipulate you need like five pages left or something for them to let you in
D	mm
A	so we got a bumper passport paid for an extra twenty pages or something and then they're like oh because you finished your other passport early we're gonna give you an extra nine months or something so I actually we actually ten years and nine months but
C	oh
A	time's not the issue
D	mm
A	space is the issue but I
C	yeah
A	think it's not gonna last ten years and nine months so
B	just give me more pages
A	just give me more pages
D	mm
A	up until recently Americans could have pages added at a consulate for free
B	yeah yeah they do often
D	oh really?
A	they just go to the consulate and get pages put into their passport no worries but they've just changed that and now they don't
B	yeah yeah they do it often yeah we could never do that
A	so we didn't but we couldn't
B	it's like
C	yeah
A	has
D	no
A	this is a bummer being British man not only is
A	but really like you have to be from Australia England Ireland you know what I mean these kind of countries
B	South Africa
A	and then basically England is the most expensive country out of all the other countries
D	mm
A	maybe Australia is a little bit more expensive in certain regards but they're paid more out of all those countries we're the only one that don't have a reciprocal deal with Korea whereby we refund their pension and therefore they refund our pension
C	oh
A	so we've been paying into the pension every year that we've been there every month
C	that sucks
A	and they owe us five thousand pounds and every other person each and every person that leaves Korea gets
D	mm
B	the worst thing about it is
A	and it gets doubled fuck
B	yeah the worst thing is you pay in like four per cent and your company has to match that
A	match that and then at the end
B	and then at the end of it Americans Canadians claim
A	you get it
B	the entire eight per cent not just their money but also
A	so they
B	their school makes
A	so they walk home with like five to ten thousand pounds
D	mm
B	so they're actually doubling their money
D	oh
A	no worries and we don't get that
B	for some bizarre reason
A	and there's only one other people that don't get it and that's South Africans but they don't have to pay
B	but they don't have to pay yeah yeah
D	mm
A	so they don't pay it every month but we have to pay it as Brits but we don't get it back
[ANNOTATION]	South Africans have to pay.	Contradiction
B	and that's because I think it's because we have
C	how come that
A	because we don't have a reciprocal deal
B	I
A	of Koreans England doesn't really
C	mm
B	massive millions like thousands
D	mm
B	like it's huge like
A	we have one pot
B	which completely covers all our health care and all of that kind of shit
A	mm nobody gets a refund on national insurance nobody
B	obviously the rest of the
A	so
B	have it like that in Korea it's broken down the and our
A	you do your health care you do your pension you do your something
B	wages that have like our taxes our health care our pension like it's broken down into different funds whereas in England there's one pot so that
A	so we're a bit bitter about that
C	yeah that but then knowing that like you are like five grand plus like
B	yeah it would it would
A	mm mm mm
B	it would be nice for them to change that law or
A	we're hoping we've been doing petitions and like contacting the government and it's
B	but also there's not that
A	we
C	even if you give
B	four thousand British people
C	like even if they just give you your four per cent back
A	mm
B	yeah exactly
A	yeah I know that's what we say just give us what I paid for
B	isn't that reasonable?
C	do you know what I mean? like you might
B	I know
A	we had the same problem with health care there we had to pay
C	and that's it
A	about
C	yeah times
A	two and a half grand do you know what I mean? on on health care
B	and they never use the doctors
A	and the problem is in their country
B	and also it's subsidised so you can actually get it for free anyway
A	yeah yeah so
B	if I want to go
A	and you're already paying for health care but it's subsidised so you still have to pay to go and then in Korea
B	at least the service is a little bit better
A	if you have anything serious and serious can just be asthma or diabetes they don't let you even live there they deport you immediately so if you get anything serious they deport you so basically we're paying this money for insurance for nothing out of the whole two it's four years we were there
B	it's as if you had an accident or something
A	I need to do you ever go to the doctor's? I went once cos I had a terrible ear infection I got antibiotics
B	I can't remember when
A	but I spent about two hundred two and half grand for those antibiotics
B	yeah he had an infection
A	it was just a bit like
B	but you had
A	when you're only on fourteen grand
B	some like again Americans think it's amazing even if it's expensive
A	yeah they're like wow it's so cheap but
C	yeah
B	but even with insurance we had a friend
A	mm
B	and erm she had to go into hospital for like five days or something and into a room and I think at the end
A	yeah like a grand or something
B	I think it cost her
A	maybe two grand
B	a couple of grand and she thought that was incredibly cheap cos she said in America it would cost her so much more and I was like well if I need to go into a hospital in England and have anything done it's free
D	I don't pay for it
B	I don't have to worry about
A	yeah but that's the thing it's not we've already paid for it
B	with the taxes yeah
D	yeah
A	we're taxed out of our asses
B	but regardless
D	yeah well
B	but it's
D	someone
B	but it's like yeah
A	yeah
B	I don't wanna yeah
A	no
B	I don't want I don't know
A	personally I'd rather they didn't tell us about tax and we just got money
D	mm
A	and like taxes are already deducted you know what I mean? I don't see it come out
D	yeah
C	you just don't know about it
A	it's just my pay it's
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	the thing that annoys me the most is council tax when they send you like the itemised bill to show you that like
B	ah yeah to show you what is going on
C	ten P goes to the fire brigade ten P goes to the police department and then like
D	the rest goes to the fucking council
A	yeah
C	the rest of it goes to the council and I'm like no no no no if there's a fire in my house like a representative of Medway council is not gonna be climbing up here to put it out
D	yeah mm
C	like they're gonna phone me and tell me that the building's condemned and that I've gotta move out
A	yeah
C	like
A	that's it
C	I want the fire brigade to be there give more money
A	yeah
C	to them and the ambulance people
B	yeah ambulance and the and the hospitals
C	who are gonna be yeah
D	mm
C	who are dragging my charcoaled body out of the building
C	like the Medway Council anyway like
B	I know surely the hospital should be
D	yeah the hospital is like er
C	it's it's it's a charity isn't it?
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah why is it well why is it a charity?
D	but give them more money they they shouldn't be a charity they should have a helicopter they need a helicopter
C	do you want any more beer?
A	yeah I'll have a Kronenbourg
C	yeah? do you want a cider?
D	I'm not paying for it but
A	do you want a beer?
D	no no no I'm can't drink anymore
A	yeah cool
B	I'll have the I'll have a cider
C	yeah?
B	go on is that alright?
A	I've
A	yeah no no no of course
A	I've always thought with taxes it baffles
B	sorry
C	no no no it's fine
B	shouldn't let your mouth run dry
A	it baffles me
D	mm
A	it baffles me why
D	mm
A	instead of simply taxing the corporations
D	mm
A	so let's say there're seventy million people and there are twenty thousand corporations okay?
D	mm
A	the only way for us to earn money is through corporations
D	mm
A	therefore instead of fucking around with seventy million people just tax
D	tax the
A	twenty thousand companies
D	mm
A	and they've gotta pay me so therefore they should pay tax
D	they can pay yeah
A	yeah I don't understand why we don't just tax companies or basically the companies get away with paying nothing
D	mm
A	pretty much and we have to pay everything but it just seems like less work
D	mm
A	we don't need seventy million bits of paperwork
D	mm
A	we just need twenty thousand
D	mm
A	tax the company that's it and then I just get paid what I get paid
D	mm
A	the tax is already deducted and all this kind of stuff cos it's kinda depressing to get your paycheck from all the work's gone through that
D	yeah
A	and that's gone through that I'd rather just have that already gone with it
D	mm
A	that's my
D	yeah
A	to kind of go through
D	yeah I don't I don't mind taxes too much
A	but in England's pretty high man
D	yeah it's pretty high but then we've got free health care we get we know if something happens the police are gonna come round the fire brigade's gonna come round
A	you're right it's true
D	and pretty much all the infrastructure is taken care of
A	yeah
D	the Medway Council's shit but the roads are looked after
A	everything's
D	everything's done
A	everything's clean yes
D	everything yeah yeah it's good
A	no I'm not gonna lie having lived in poorer countries
D	yeah
A	we have a good system here we do
D	yeah
A	but at the same time we pay
D	yeah yeah we do pay for it
A	we pay about fifty per cent in tax
D	yeah
A	now most people would actually say fifty per cent it's
D	mm
A	if you take the hundred per cent that you earn and say twenty per cent is
D	mm
A	twenty per cent on everything you buy I mean
D	mm
A	what are you gonna spend your money on?
D	yeah
D	mm
A	road tax all these other kinds of taxes I reckon we spend fifty per cent in England on taxes I reckon
B	when you add VAT
A	yeah seriously twenty per cent income
B	going on about the taxes oh don't even get him started
A	ten per cent NI twenty per cent no but I agree with what
B	yeah
A	we do have a
B	a system that will
A	first world developed country
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	there's the Queen there's industries that work
B	that accommodates for everyone
D	yeah
D	yeah I mean take somewhere like American like
B	and I really no no
D	someone poor tries to go to the hospital
A	but
B	it's like they know they should never
A	but do you realise how much your money is spent on warfare every year?
D	yeah yeah quite a lot
C	yeah yeah of course
A	er the amount we spend on warfare in one
D	mm
A	year
D	is ridiculous
A	is enough to feed clothe and educate the entire world
D	mm yeah
A	one year of warfare that's it
C	yeah
A	if we just said we had an amnesty this year we're not gonna have war in fifty countries we
D	mm
A	you could feed clothe and educate the whole world the whole world
C	for a year
A	one year no
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	the statistics are yeah dubious
C	yeah
A	and not to be trusted in general
C	yeah well no of course
B	no of course
A	but er I ignore statistics I don't like
B	but I do like I do agree
D	mm
A	I like statistics I do like
A	that's what I like you know
B	there shouldn't
A	I don't
B	but you do your er health
A	mm
B	when I was in that that primary school in my first year one of the children had epilepsy and she had a fit and my
A	we were pretty poor
B	they were really quite worried about the child because the mother didn't wanna she was like the mother should take her to hospital or more but she doesn't cos of the cost
C	mm
B	and even the cost was meant to be reduced it still costs and I don't think any parent should ever be in a position that they hesitate to take their child
A	mm
C	yeah
B	and in England no parent is ever ever in that position
D	no sure no
C	no you take your child to hospital at any
B	or in Europe and that should be the standard you should never ever hesitate
D	mm
B	about taking some especially if something's serious as epilepsy
A	yet conversely we have old people dying because they can't afford to put their heating on you
B	of
A	to say that we're a first world country we have an amazing health care system yeah our utilities are through the roof
B	yeah no that's amazing
A	our public transport system is quite frankly bonkers
C	yeah I er yeah
A	it's completely bonkers
C	oh my god don't
D	oh
A	every time I look at the National Express I'm like oh I wanna go from here to Canterbury gotta drive through London
D	mm
A	gotta stop in Heathrow for four hours
D	mm
C	yeah
D	mm
A	so the journey takes eight hours to get to Canterbury
C	that makes no sense
B	and the price is so high
A	so I don't like
B	I
D	mm
A	I don't like that because that's effectively saying we've finished developing
C	mm
A	we done yeah we're as good as it gets we're developed and I just think until
A	until utilities
D	we're more economically developed but
B	it's just interesting cos whenever you we
A	until utilities are free I don't think we're developed
B	when they
A	that was interesting
B	and they considered Korea developing
A	they think Korea's a third world country
D	mm
A	the people of Korea believe that they're a developing country
B	they
C	how weird
A	yeah I found that quite interesting and I said to them no you're developed
B	and I said no you are not I said wait are you are you Africa?
A	you're a developed country
B	are you like
C	yeah not at all
B	China?
A	they're so racist though
B	I mean all Asian
A	all Asian countries are pretty racist but I mean these guys are very very xenophobic
B	even on the aeroplane actually there'll be sometimes you're on er coming into Korea I don't know which airline we were with and you could hear them talking about
A	yeah yeah yeah they
B	or the thing there's a massive dispute
A	it's very communist its capitalism
B	between an island as if this is island is not even an island it's a fucking rock is it Japanese or is it Korean? and Korea claims it's Korean
C	oh okay
B	and Korea techinically is like think only
D	mm
A	they don't really like the Chinese
B	at the moment but you can't always use it as
A	everyone hates the Japenese basically in the entire nation
D	yeah everyone in Asia who did we meet? the Japanese guy
B	they do really hate the Japanese
A	they hate the Japenese
D	and then what was it? you were talking about China and he was like
A	this giant
D	oh I don't mind Chinese the Koreans we hate
A	yeah
D	and I was like oh
A	don't mention the war
B	was it the Japenese guy that said that?
C	yeah
D	yeah yeah cos I started bringing up China and I was obviously thinking of World War Two
B	yeah I know they usually the Japanese
C	I always get really
B	yeah yeah I know
A	we had erm I
C	I always get erm
B	it's usually the Koreans that hate the Japanese
A	a textbook at school we had a textbook at school and it would have stereotypes of different cultures and it would have an American girl and she'd have like
B	there was a cowgirl
A	cowgirls with guns
D	mm
A	and like a hat and then a Dutch
B	the British gentleman
A	British gentleman they had a Dutch woman
D	mm
C	yeah
A	with no
B	they had the Africans
C	yeah
A	just as Tarzan with the
B	with black face
A	seriously as soon as you we had an Indian friend and she's going to work and they go
B	she was
A	Indian she's American Indian
C	no
A	they're terrible
B	yeah it's it's very ingrained in like their textbooks and their culture and
A	mm and their culture and everything
B	and they're obviously like the superior Asian race
A	they're very racist if you've got a student in your class
D	mm
B	but I think I think they're all the same
A	that's like Vietnamese
D	mm
A	they hate him
B	I think they all teach themselves to be
A	they don't talk to the Vietnamese student do you know what I mean?
B	ohh it's really bad cos then
A	it's really harsh I mean if one student's like Japenese
D	mm
A	or something or Vietnamese or Philippino or whatever
B	because the Koreans are marked Koreans are like
D	but it's the same in
B	they're all the same
B	yeah
D	amongst themselves? them few countries
A	they have quite a big history
B	yeah
D	they get this sense that they're all
A	around that area
D	okay but then it's that cos they've got erm
A	but historically
D	what was it?
A	Thai went Thailand went to war with Cambodia Vietnam went to war with Cambodia
D	yeah yeah
A	Laos got completely fucked over
D	mm
A	historically I guess it's a bit like Europe but in the modern age
D	mm yeah
A	they're south-east Asia
B	yeah
A	they're earning a lot of money
D	mm mm
B	and there's a lot of
A	through tourism and like
D	mm
B	crossline like cross-immigration going on yeah
A	cross-immigration and all that kind of stuff
D	mm
A	so they're fairly tight but
D	yeah
B	but they get really
A	I think historically they have issues
D	well it's the same as Europe
B	but in er
A	yeah they do
D	and now it's more just the joke
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
D	like with French people here
B	yeah I actually had like some like students
D	oh you're Spanish ha ha
B	becuase my
[ANNOTATION]	French people don't live in this place.	Contradiction
D	you're German
B	it's so like ingrained in their education even like eighteen-year-old Koreans absolutely hated them
D	Strauss
C	mm
B	for the Japenese that hated them years ago
D	the sausage bunting
B	and erm my students would be like
D	German sausages
A	do you wanna go down the
D	that's that's only a lie that's only a lie
A	yeah that's racist isn't it? yeah I think
B	I don't think they've been educated to hate any other country
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Koreans loved Germans.	Contradiction
B	but like Korea is just like no we hate the Japanese
A	the problem is that the only bit he likes is the
B	but I mean that was a long time ago
A	which is a lot more
B	yeah no yeah exactly it's not like rural Korea like
B	and then marrying a lot of er marrying in a lot of Vietnamese
A	sorry
B	and women are meant to marry the Korean farmers cos they
A	there're a lot of Russian prostitutes
[ANNOTATION]	In the past, Korean hated Japanese people.	Entailment
B	you know like all of them go to university all of them are after the best jobs possible no one wants a farmer anymore so they they are bringing in other south-eastern Asians er east Asian nations to marry these farmers and one of my friends that were
D	fuck
A	they treated them like shit
B	like were completely treated like shit and they're really poor just basically
A	there's a lot of Russian prostitutes as well
[ANNOTATION]	People from south-east Asia started getting married Korean farmed around 1950.	Neutral
B	they really fit in a workforce
A	and like western girls if you
D	mm
B	just out of the immigrants but like
A	if you're blonde as a foreigner you'd be confused for a Russian prostitute like quite frequently
B	only in certain places
A	I mean you have been
[ANNOTATION]	Ginger people can be confused for being Russian.	Contradiction
A	yeah she wasn't blonde but then there was something
B	there was something different about
A	South Africans are sound by the way
D	mm
B	she wore like a I don't know if it was her flurry dresses
A	just to give you an example
D	yeah yeah
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	People from South Africa have a heavy pronunciation.	Neutral
B	but she got called Russian all the time
D	she
C	yeah
A	she they are racist
C	they're racist yeah
D	yeah
A	yeah
C	she
D	she er what did they have? er like black housekeepers and stuff
C	she used to have a nanny that used to yeah
D	and they used to
B	I don't think that's
C	yeah we have to pay them
D	yeah you racist do you own slave?
C	but then they had them
A	I can't imagine
B	no none of
A	what it's like growing up there
D	mm
B	none of our friends are racist in South Africa
A	I think
A	yeah I think erm
B	who else?
B	I don't think
C	I think it's a bit
B	we barely hang out with them
A	I got I got the impression no but from what they she's
A	they're conscious in general I don't think they're racist
A	as such but they're segregating which is a form or racism
C	yeah
D	mm
C	yeah
A	I think
C	that's the same with
D	yeah when you were twenty-eight you had to you you couldn't
C	but it was like you were brought up as like a young
A	they're culturally racist effectively but but they're they're racist themselves
C	white girl
B	white girl yeah yeah
C	like you don't get the train you don't get the tube if you can't get driven
A	no yeah
C	you don't go
A	that's what they're like
D	mm
C	and that's because
C	the
A	it is yeah
C	the impoverished
B	yeah
A	they actually have it a little worse than that I kinda feel a little bit sorry for them cos
B	but I don't think that
A	they really
C	mm
A	there's quite a big difference
D	mm
A	but their passport is the same
[ANNOTATION]	the passport reveals little difference	Entailment
D	mm
A	so if a South African wants to go and live in Europe that's really hard and like there're numerous places
B	or even to travel like
A	to travel numerous countries where they've they
A	they get she got interviewed all the time like
B	just to go to
A	and like it's really hard to go to places
B	they have to go thourgh a massive visa
A	they're very very limited because they're South African
D	mm
A	their passport doesn't give them access
B	which is why a lot of them are in a lot of them
A	we in England have one of the best passports in the world
B	are in Korea
[ANNOTATION]	Koreans can travel easily	Neutral
A	we can access
C	that's true
A	because
B	basically
A	because we colonised the world basically it's ours for the day
D	yeah
B	no but
C	ah us and the French
A	and the Portuguese and Spanish the Dutch
D	mm
B	running off and trying to live in one of these countries cos they're like well your country's fine
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	England colonized many places	Entailment
B	but they yeah
A	no effectively we've enslaved the world and we why do you think India has a a devalued currency?
D	mm
A	or other
D	mm
A	that's it so we've purposefully made countries poor by saying that your currency is not worth very much we've basically turned around and said your currency is not worth very much so it's really difficult for you to leave and come to our country but it's easy for us to buy products from your country
C	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	France did not have many colonies	Contradiction
B	basically if you have a good amount of resources you're fucked
A	you're fucked yeah if you if you're that's why I read something interesting about why America is one of the most successful countries in in the world and they believe that it's because it doesn't have many resources as a country for how much space it's got it's not particularly you know
B	it has some
A	your resources aren't particulatly ubiquitous whereas like because of that they've had to conquer other places they've had to go to other places and take their kind of stuff and it's I mean and they've got very very rich
B	but
[ANNOTATION]	America is a rich country	Entailment
A	minerals in Latin America Central America I don't know if you know much about Reagan and the Contra Wars
B	they're just an extension of England really
A	and all this kind of stuff but
C	no about Reagan no
B	though there's you can't really say America it's just really an extension of
A	oh it's not just oh America is an extension of the British Empire I don't see it in any difference but
[ANNOTATION]	American is different from the British Empire	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	but the same America as a country is is for thar
B	that wants to practise his English
A	and he wants to practise his English he's lived in Amercia for a few years they kicked him out and he's trying to get back in but it's not easy to get back in and that was a really common story we met loads of people that'd lived there
B	they're on their way back up to
A	got kicked out
D	mm
A	they wanna get back in but they're a bit bitter about the whole thing so they come
D	mm
A	and I don't blame them for that but
C	yeah
A	it wasn't safe to kinda travel around because I mean the population of Honduras is like four million people and there are one million of them in the States like one quarter of their entire population and that's normal for Central America like a quarter of their population is at any moment living in the United States illegally or legally
D	mm
B	trade in America's interesting they have a massive massive Hispanic population
A	they're very mixed
B	yeah but
A	not like England we're trying to explain that it's not just a dodgy area it's a dodgy street you know?
D	mm
D	yeah
B	we're so much smaller
A	whereas they're like well you know
B	concentration
A	I'm from
D	mm
A	but don't go to Memphis because it's you know it's all
D	yeah
B	well it's not even that it's just like
C	yeah
D	the thing the thing that is
B	yeah it is a lot closer yeah
A	well they banned slavery a hell of a lot later than anyone else
B	yeah yeah
D	yeah we yeah and like
B	and a lot of that
D	but in other countries like the impoverished are it's it's not
A	us
D	it's not done on a race or a creed or religion like it's everyone
B	race no no no yeah yeah
D	in that area is impoverished because the area
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	whereas I think the Americans
B	yeah yeah exactly
D	whereas in America it's obviously like their racial history
B	they're worse yeah yeah
D	so the
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	definitely and like
D	the impoverished and rather than
B	and they'll never get out of that
A	and the people
B	because it's such a big enough place that they can have an entire town
D	mm
B	or entire city
D	mm
B	where they just completely turn around and well I'm not gonna live there I'm gonna live here
D	mm
C	yeah
A	and the Americans that we met in Korea
B	whereas we're not
A	were from the demographic of white middle-class America
B	but the once that well they had to have a degree to be there
A	most most of them would
D	mm
B	so yeah
A	and therefore already
D	mm
A	what I found
B	some of them were really really nice
A	a clear divide between British people I met in Korea and American people I met in Korea American people always regardless of how liberal you think they are are patriotic at heart
C	oh yeah I think
A	and they love where they're from
D	mm
A	pretty much every single American loves where they're from I didn't meet a single British person that loves where they're from
D	that's why they fucked off
A	not one
B	yeah
A	exactly we go there to escape to a certain degree
D	mm
A	they go there as a break
C	mm
D	mm
A	before they get a real job and we find that a little bit offensive cos this for us is our real job but the amount of people that turn around and go yeah this I'm gonna go and get a real job this is just fucking around for a while
A	oh this job is so easy yeah if you don't take it seriously it's easy
C	mm
A	but if you actually try to teach and like
B	they're
C	yeah
A	they're getting stricter
B	yeah you gotta have yours
A	I mean back in the day you didn't need a degree or anything now you must have a degree
B	now you
A	now you must have a TEFL certificate of some sort
B	yeah
A	and you must have so they're getting stricter but
C	yeah
A	we met was I feel like we were more representative
C	mm
A	of the working class of the people there
B	or at least their families were and stuff like that
A	most of the Americans were we take back
D	mm
A	like you and that
B	and then he's doing his private contracting in Afghanistan
A	he just bought that didn't cost very much yeah
B	he's an Afghanistan
A	he's getting black money from Afghanistan or whatever
C	yeah
A	erm they've got a lovely detached house in the middle of nowhere like
B	that's cheap in America that's cheaper
A	loads of space
B	yeah cos
A	and they've got like a massive detached house with a pond and loads of land and a forest and all this kind of stuff
B	that is so much cheaper
A	we're
C	with licences
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and we're trying to explain to them that effectively we live in terraced houses
B	we needed to have licenses
D	yeah
A	I try and say to
C	yeah
B	yeah that's cos
A	all of them pretty much
B	that's cos
A	yes so it's actually quite equitable their land size's about the same as England and their population is about the same as England as well
B	ignoring like ignoring Scotland and Wales
C	oh
A	yeah just England
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	forty-five fifty million?
D	mm
A	they have fifty million people the land size's equitable however Korea's seventy per cent mountains you can't build or live on them
D	mm
A	so they have to build up and I kinda say to them England's pretty similar the only difference is we don't we take those high-rise buildings and we turn them on their side
D	down mm
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah and it's what terraced is
A	and that's terraced yeah that's what it is
C	yeah
B	and that's what it is yeah
A	Americans don't really know terraced they don't seem to have it
D	yeah
C	I mean there's some
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	like our road is all terraced houses
B	yeah yeah
D	yeah but
C	and then you go out in the back and then there's like
D	there was a dockyard
B	yeah yeah exactly
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah exactly this is why I
D	mm
B	these houses that are around factories and dockyards
C	yeah they are
A	they can't believe that we walk out of our house and there's a church down the road
B	houses
A	that's eight hundred years old
D	mm
C	mm
A	what?
B	but they would say like why would you wanna live on top of each other? and I'm like
A	they knock everything down every four years
C	yeah
A	cos it's the same
B	yeah they they hate that they don't like brick houses and like or concrete and stuff they're like but I'm like yeah
C	I mean many years ago
A	but they knock everything down Americans are like it stimulates
D	mm
A	the economy when this business goes under we they don't use that building again and put another business in they knock it down and build another building
D	mm
A	Korea's the same they will knock a building down and rebuild another building they build numerous high
B	like ten years ago
A	like ten years ago but now we were living in it and then this other area called
A	they dredged from the sea and just built shit loads of high-rise there shit loads and it's probably running at about ten to twenty per cent capacity there's like hundreds upon hundreds of flats there China has the same problem apparently Chinese people from what I've heard cannot take large amounts of money out of the country they're not allowed therefore they have to reinvest in their own country so they build all these high-rises that nobody needs yet but they presume they will need in the future
B	they will in the future
A	so there's just massive areas when we were in China just high-rise after high-rise after high-rise and no one in it there was like no one living there and yet there're still homeless people
D	mm
A	why are there homeless people when there's
C	that doesn't make any sense
A	no
B	no yeah exactly
A	but it's the same in America you could
D	yeah
C	yeah
A	there is no reason for there to be homeless people effectively
D	no it's the same thing in London there're loads of places people in London they go around
C	mm
B	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
D	to say this needs to be filled
C	yeah
D	this is London we need houses
B	houses yeah they just
C	yeah
D	sort it out or they'll take it from you
A	yeah
C	in
D	yeah
C	in fact it was that they came they come over for like
B	people that yeah invest in a property
C	well because
D	and then just forget about it and abandon it
C	the guys have like
A	oh I'm now rich
D	yeah
A	just forget I own that shit
C	yeah the guys have a thing what was it?
D	oh the
C	yeah before they get married they have like a summer or year sometimes in the UK
D	a year where they it's almost like
C	and it's just like an extreme blowout like just do whatever you want it's fine
C	but then it's it's great because
D	mm well it's because they're rich isn't it? so it's like
C	they kind of
B	yeah yeah yeah why not?
C	and they like have their super cars like shipped over at least like like
B	yeah
C	I don't know like a scarf and they come in and they
B	better be a fucking nice scarf
D	mm
C	yeah and they like park up outside in their like incredible amazing like super cars and some of them are like one was velvet like actually velvet and there's like neon
B	yeah yeah it's easiest to buy a house and then just forget about it
C	so you just buy a house and then they leave after the year they ship their car back and they just kinda forget that the house is there
D	yeah like go back and then get married and they take over their parents' business
B	yeah basically
C	so then the house is just there and like
D	so they get a year to do what the fuck they want
C	yeah they spend just like insane amounts of money
A	oh get squattors rights on that shit
D	yeah
C	yeah right? that's what I would do
B	yeah they are
C	but there're all these incredible incredible houses like whole houses in
B	yeah I know
A	it's crazy
C	and they just forget about it
B	and they're just vacant
C	and they're just like goodbye
A	I'm trying to get
C	there was a woman that went in and there was like still like paperwork and stuff like they left like their clothes everything they literally she was like
C	she flies in an hour I'm gonna go now and then just left
B	it's a complete
A	I'm that rich
B	that's actually one of the
C	it's literally like
B	I mean
A	is that they're too rich
B	you're just teaching a bunch of spoilt cunts
C	yeah
D	they get paid to go to university don't they?
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	and like
D	and they get a wage
A	probably
D	so long as they turn up in class they get a wage
A	it's not very easy teaching like that
B	at least they're not
D	no I know
A	even if we're married
B	that's not like they're selecting these courses they're just doing them because
D	mm
B	they have to and
A	even if we're married you still have to walk behind me in public
B	without written permission
A	that she can leave and on top of that neither of us can leave the country
C	ah
A	without the written permission of our boss so when
B	who takes on our passports Saudi in particularly bad
A	when we go there they take your passports yeah
C	oh my god
A	so it's not like a normal country when you're
B	it's not all of the countries it's in Saudi
C	no no no no of course not
A	it's not like a normal country where you apply for a visa and then when the time runs out they kick you out effectively in Saudi Arabia when you go there you're there forever until they let you go
D	mm
A	so you apply to leave
A	so they take your passports you can't go and then to go I have to apply to leave and
B	you have to apply
A	and
B	but it's never been particularly a problem
A	strange
B	they don't like
A	if we weren't married
B	oh if we were married yeah it's different
A	couldn't see each other touch each other be in the same area we couldn't be in the same room together as it is even married we'll be teaching at an all boy all blokes or an all girls university
B	university yeah they're segregated
C	yeah yeah
A	the difference is that we would be on a compound so like on a compound apparently I'm sure it's quite
B	that'd be a western compound
A	if it's a compound a little bit I'm sure people would kinda get enough or whatever
D	mm
A	but it's a western compound you can find out
D	yeah that's what
A	you've got a swimming pool
B	yeah
A	you've got guards and all that kind of
D	definitely you can get
B	yeah I don't know in Saudi Saudi's pretty
A	we might go back to Korea because
D	yeah
A	once we got maybe not
D	mm
A	and this was great because suddenly we're not we have a lot more responsibility and we took a massive pay cut as well I don't know if
C	yeah
A	we took a pay cut like three or four thousand pounds each to like just for in year to like do this job but we had no office hours and in the last six weeks we were running a funny course where we only did three hours in the morning so we were done at eleven every day done we'd do eight to eleven done and then we'd finish so that was lovely
C	oh
A	but we were on the bottom rung of the university ladder if you had an MA and a few more years experience there're jobs still today they give you five months' paid vacation so you work for seven months of the year and you'd get five months off
B	only three of those teachers are at the university
A	yeah and also and at uni
B	they're the ones that are teaching like English Lit majors
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	so our uni there's like twenty-five
B	or English German majors we were just teaching English language
A	there were like twenty-five teachers at our school
C	yeah
A	out of these twenty-five three of them get five months' holiday and they teach English Literature or or something like that TESL
B	like they're probably on a little bit more than us
A	a little bit more than us maybe like fifteen grand eighteen grand
B	like two maybe even more
A	something like that but they get five months' paid vacation off then there's probably another four or five people like
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	they get maybe three months off three and a half months off
B	yeah but it's it's not conceptive
A	but it's not and it's not set then there were the rest of the shitmunchers which were us we weren't on the bottom rung there was another rank below us but we were allowed on that one we got two months' vacations and that kind of stuff
B	yeah
A	if I can have a job that gives me half the year off
C	yeah that's amazing
A	that's my job that's
D	mm
C	yeah
A	that's our goal
D	mm
C	no that sounds amazing
A	but knowing all that I'm sure by the time we qualify those jobs won't exist anymore so
C	I'm sure they will maybe just not in Korea
A	I don't know they're definitely cutting down and other places aren't doing it Saudi gives you like two months off
B	but it depends on the university
A	what kind of technician
D	it's still good
A	it's good yeah
D	four weeks
A	it's good yeah
D	twenty days
A	it's eight it's eight weeks then
B	what is?
D	yeah
A	two months
D	yeah well yeah
A	maybe even ten
D	twenty twenty days extends to twenty-five throughout the year
C	yeah
A	the good thing about England though is you choose when you take that
D	mm
A	and
D	mm
A	you can't like you we may get good vacation but it's when they dictate it's not
D	mm
B	it's cos when the school's on recession
A	yeah
D	mm
A	you can't just pop home when you need to
C	but then that's the same in English schools
B	yeah yeah that's
C	you're not gonna be able to
A	yeah
C	take like a six-week holiday
A	no
C	during terms and you can only have holidays during
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	yeah it's part of teaching
C	yeah there's there's it's kind of like the the worst bit about the job I guess
A	like the process yeah
C	it's that you
A	it's definitely hard though like living abroad's been tough sometimes like you wanna be there for your friends you wanna be there for your family and you can't sometimes
C	no but I think that's just
A	you lose your job
C	that's just life though isn't it? really you can't always be there
A	yeah
D	mm
A	just takes a while to realise though and you can't always yeah
C	yeah
A	it's nice though that we come home and like you got some pretty close friends that you come back and you just
C	yeah
D	mm
C	it is always kind of the same though when you come back it's always like you never left
B	you never left yeah
C	I always get really excited when I first see you and I'm like this is really weird
B	yeah
A	that's the longest we haven't seen anyone
C	yeah
B	yeah the last time was
A	but the weirdest thing I think and maybe you'll all agree with this
C	yeah
A	is how quick those two years went
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	so then you come home and you're like fuck me it's been two fucking years
D	mm
C	I think like
A	it's been five years since I met you guys
D	mm
A	you know what I mean?
C	I think
C	yeah when you left I was twenty-five
B	why don't I get IDed anymore?
C	it was erm
B	I was twenty-one before
C	I don't know I think like
B	yeah
C	and then I was like fuck that's a really long time
B	you
C	got to like the last six months like it went really quick
B	it went really quick
C	so I went to
D	mm
C	and I think it was six weeks
B	yeah and I think that's
C	until you come back and you're like no six months
C	and I was like oh okay
A	oh okay
C	and then it was six weeks like within like a heartbeat and I was like
B	it did go quick yeah
C	fuck it's actually and now it's like today and like
B	it doesn't erm yeah
A	well I hope if we live a little bit closer and you guys are finished with your MA and you got a bit more spare cash
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	then we can kind of if not come to where we are maybe meet in our holidays like meet somewhere in Europe
D	mm
A	or something like that
C	yeah that would be really nice
B	alright in in the future yeah
A	in the future yeah I mean we've got many years left
B	not this year
D	mm
A	we're not quite done
A	I mean
B	I don't know
C	yeah I want a I want a house it's my thing
D	we're gonna have to be done
A	back twice
B	yeah yeah you've got to invest into something
A	really? how much?
B	not as much as
C	not as much as
D	anything
A	really?
A	you're rich
C	no I'm not rich
B	maybe
D	are you rich?
A	come on
B	no
A	what?
C	yeah but she she how much has she inherited?
A	what?
C	like forty thousand from her nan and her dad doubled it
B	and her dad
D	mm
B	oh cos her dad had to match that
A	what? what?
C	yeah because
A	cos it's his pension isn't it?
B	they
C	it's like I want my house back get the fuck out of my house
D	yeah
C	that's why yeah
B	yeah yeah they did I don't know maybe
D	she got really she got really
B	I don't know she hasn't been there long enough for it to
A	so how close to eighty-six are you
C	fifty
B	the thing was that
A	oh that's pretty nice though
C	is that inherited as well?
B	for one of them he will do for all of them
D	mm
C	yeah they're all completely
B	that means he matched all of their inheritance
C	yeah
D	mm
A	that fifty
A	have you been saving on that? well
C	yeah
A	you haven't been spending it on clothes
C	well no it used to be sixty
A	oh man
C	but erm
D	yeah but then you had
B	yeah you did a really nice
A	that was four years ago
C	yeah five now
A	sorry to hear that
C	no no no that's okay so
B	no no no yeah
C	I
A	but you
B	yeah
C	but then that's like like I was saying to
A	yeah of course yeah
C	so that's why I really wanna buy a house
C	because the thing is is I'm quite happy to like buy a house
B	invest it yeah otherwise it will all just keep going down
D	yeah
C	and then just have like tenants in who will pay the mortgage and then I can just go travelling or do whatever I wanna do I need to I wanna have a house
A	I think it's really impressive and respectable that you've held on to that
B	what you need is
D	mm
A	I think most people of your age would've be probably
C	yeah
A	just bunged it on
B	yeah but it completely worked your entire time through your MAs
C	yeah I know
B	and stuff whereas other people would just be like
C	yeah I know
B	no I'm not gonna work
A	a part of us a little bit wishes that we'd got with at least one of us could've been from a slightly wealthy family would've been nice
B	I know
C	yeah but I mean it's
B	I never expected it
C	yeah you don't
A	we ain't got a shit coming that's
B	yeah that's fine
C	you don't want it the thing is even when it's like you don't wanna it like
A	no of course
B	no yeah yeah
C	you don't really wanna it so it's kind of
A	you you want you want that member of your family not not the money you know what I mean?
C	yeah of course you do and it was only I think that only
D	it was the insurance
C	yeah I wouldn't have had anything it's because my mum had life insurance
D	mm
B	oh really?
C	that was the only reason I got it
B	oh right
C	because obviously I mean the house
A	so they do pay out on that shit then?
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what it was
A	and they paid the mortgage didn't they?
C	they paid off the rest of the mortgage
B	oh really?
C	yeah that's why like
D	mm it was
C	a house yeah
A	fair play to you for hanging on to it
B	yeah yeah yeah I didn't realise that that was on life insurance
A	I'm sure your erm I'm sure your mum would be very proud
C	yeah my mum has no money
B	how long has she had that policy for?
C	how long has she had it? she my mum had the policy after my dad died
B	that was a really long time
[ANNOTATION]	the father died long ago	Entailment
C	my dad had yeah so my dad had life insurance which was obviously fortunate because then when he died then they paid off the house so then she was fine but then you know she sold the house and moved up north
B	oh really?
C	and then that kind of disappeared cos
B	yeah
C	and then
A	how long ago did your dad pass if you don't mind me asking?
C	when I was like
B	three or four
C	three like eighty-nine quite a long time ago
A	you don't remember much
C	no I don't remember so
B	she decided to take a policy
C	to take a policy yeah she's always had a policy
B	ah
C	but like
[ANNOTATION]	the mother does not live in the old house	Entailment
A	very formal thinking wasn't it?
D	yeah
C	oh my god
D	cos she'd been paying it
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the mother want to get more insurance	Neutral
C	yeah
D	as soon as we
C	but then like my sister who's got like
B	yeah
C	phenomenal like
A	sign me up
D	yeah
C	insurance policies so because then you can get house insurance well like er insurance on your poperty or your mortgage that my mum's or
B	wow
C	so my sister has
[ANNOTATION]	the sister has no insurance	Contradiction
B	how how how high is it though?
C	it's quick and you're talking like an extra hundred pound or something like that with all I think with all of the insurances together it's about an extra hundred hundred and
D	it
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah cos
D	the more expensive it will be
C	yeah cos your family history
B	you will be more high risk and that kind of stuff
[ANNOTATION]	the insurance premium varies	Entailment
C	my family history it will cost a fucking fortune
B	yeah
C	but it might balance out
B	yeah
C	but yeah but like
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the premium will be adjusted	Neutral
C	they'll like pay off like ten grand er towards mortgage like loads of weird
A	is he going deaf?
C	weird little things no no no he's not he's not deaf
B	no no no it's an example
C	but like you know like
A	just random examples
C	yeah just a random example if someone like lost an arm or
A	if if someone goes deaf yeah
C	you know something like that
B	so it might mean that like
D	it's just money so you can take the time off work
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah exactly cos somebody has to take
D	so you don't have to worry about that yeah
B	time off work if your child goes deaf then you need extra care
D	yeah yeah of course
C	so you just
B	so your sister's got that?
C	yeah so that's what she's got so if any er I think the cancer generally is a critical illness
B	anything yeah
A	yeah
C	and they're not paying for the mortgage
D	no they're just bloody
B	oh that's crazy though cos that's because it's becoming so common now
C	yeah well I guess it's like it's not a bad thing to have
B	no yeah exactly it's kind of like
C	you know?
B	a good thing to have actually
C	especially if like the main like if anything like if
B	oh yeah absolutely
C	so like they would have no income
B	no yeah
D	mm
C	like at all and they wouldn't be able to do anything
C	yeah yeah yeah yeah she had leuchemia
A	and your dad?
C	er a brain tumour
B	yeah
A	sorry to hear that
C	that's okay
A	cancer's so rife isn't it? I mean
C	yeah
D	mm
B	yeah
A	my er dad's
D	there's nothing else
C	yeah our generation
B	no no no it's gotta teach something to us
D	well cancer's
C	no well I don't think
A	I thought my dad's
B	you can't live till sixty-five that's too old
A	I thought my dad's partner was a goner
D	mm
A	like a year a year ago a year and a half cos she went completely blind like when blind went into her brain and like
B	yeah it's amazing
A	all this kind of stuff and like
C	how long was she blind for?
A	er maybe like a month or something yeah a couple of months something like that
B	a couple of months maybe
A	it was pretty scary and I thought
B	it was a couple of years ago
A	I thought that was game over
B	yeah
A	and she's kinda sad after my parents split like I think my dad might've married her but she's quite wealthy and he's not
C	mm
D	mm
A	and now she's sick he doesn't wanna marry her because he feels like it'll be like he's trying to get her money so he's not
D	mm
A	anyway there's nothing to do anyway
B	no
A	she's pretty ill
B	yeah
A	out of my mum's three best friends her three best friends one's already dead from cancer one has had stomach cancer and the other one is
D	mm
C	yeah
A	the statistics
D	mm
C	what's that one in three people
A	where does that statistic come from?
B	yeah exactly
A	is that
D	mm it's the average
B	I don't know where that statistic comes from
A	is that only is the stastic like
D	average yeah
C	yeah I just think it's
D	like
C	yeah
A	it
D	so people like my great nan who's a hundred now and still picking on
B	yeah and she's still living you told me she's still playing the piano
C	yeah
A	well
D	she's she's so active
A	okay
D	so she's dragging the average up a little bit
A	okay so we're talking about the average the
B	she really is though isn't she?
A	think about
C	I'm going to
C	all of you
A	all of you
D	mm
B	oh I thought she'd died
A	okay but like let's say
A	if the average age is eighty and your nan is a hundred
D	mm mm
A	and she's pulling the average up but there're people that die when they're three and when they're five
D	yeah
A	so you think that for the
D	some countries doesn't count
B	counts towards mortality
A	yeah this is what I'm saying
D	so a child that dies is infant mortality
A	because if if
B	yeah I don't think it counts
A	I don't think that any death before thirty can count
B	I reckon
A	because if you die before thirty and you wanna make an average and the average is eighty and you'd died at twenty-seven well then somebody's gonna have to be living to a hundred and forty
D	mm
A	for the average to come to eighty so
D	ah yeah but then you've got the majority of people
A	I feel like they just
B	yeah
D	if they live to say say the average is eighty if a large number of people would live to say ninety-ninety-five
A	who are these people?
C	they're all like
D	but women tend to live longer anyway so the women are dragging the average up
C	they're huge
A	are they in your family? cos they're not in mine they're not in
D	as men die younger
C	no
A	I mean who are these people?
C	my like
D	mm
B	I had one granddad that lived till ninety
A	it's a myth
C	my nan's like seventy-five or something
A	mm nobody in my family has lived beyond seventy nobody
B	my granddad got to ninety-two
A	nobody
B	I think my dad said he lived until ninety-two
A	I only knew one grandparent ever
B	my dad's seventy
A	nobody's lived
D	I've my my granddad is still alive
C	I think it's like do we have do we have like
B	how old is your dad?
D	er fifty-two
B	yeal
D	my
B	the most common
A	he's not old
B	the stop between
D	mm
C	yeah
B	I feel like people are like it's becoming much higher
C	it's changing
D	well it's that age because obviously they're the children
B	I feel like the statistic needs to change
D	of like the sixties and seventies
B	the sixties which is why my mum said
C	yeah they have like
D	they were smoking and drinking and shit like that
B	yeah yeah she says
A	and that came to us
C	yeah
B	exactly my mum said she lives
A	you know what I mean? we're gonna be like the
D	the generation before us
C	yeah yeah
D	when
B	yeah
D	but we were too young for that
C	yeah long ago
A	not that we
C	I feel like I don't think we're that bad a generation like we might've all started smoking and stuff a lot
D	mm
C	but I think most of us like
B	I don't think
C	most of us will stop by the age of thirty because everyone
D	yeah well you get home it's like the crest of medicine and science
A	I think I think I think there's been a massive
B	but I think like the damage has been done
A	I think there's a massive push
C	but before if you could smoke
B	because actually like even like
C	like at twenty-five
D	like seven years approximately
C	you like pretty much had to
B	yeah but I don't I feel like
D	yeah
A	no I'm gonna agree with
B	still the stress's been put in your body
A	okay
D	yeah but then your body is still recovering
B	yeah
A	okay then it's normal stress I am gonna agree with
A	what were we talking about?
B	death age
A	how long people live for
C	yeah
B	the damage with
C	oh no but I like
A	damage with
A	I think it's more about healthy living and healthy eating and all this kind of stuff
C	yeah
A	people recognise sugar's bad for you and all this kind of stuff nowadays so I'll agree that people are
B	I still
A	however you ladies drink a hell of a lot more than ladies ever did in the past
C	I don't know
B	yeah my mum still
C	I don't know you say
B	my mum hesitated when I said that and I was like no but surely
C	yeah
B	she's like
A	you you only got to think that alcopops were invented in the nineties
B	she was a bad example
A	they didn't just
B	but that is no
C	yeah no but they used to drink wine
A	and prior to that a woman would have a glass of wine or a martini or something now
B	she did say that
C	wow
B	she would women would never order a pint
A	never had a pint never had a beer
C	no no no no
B	like
A	this kind of stuff
B	whereas we do it completely all the time don't we?
C	my mum used to drink like a lot of Southern Comfort and stuff like that
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	but she still used to drink like quite a lot
B	yeah
A	but
C	I think when we were not
A	I would say that the average woman drinks
B	I think we still can drink more than our parents' generation
A	more today than the average woman did before
B	yeah I still think so
C	yeah
B	cos they would still be the ones that
A	but it's difficult to say we didn't live in the past so there's a lot
D	mm
C	but then we have like other things as well like
C	our diet is a lot better than what maybe our parents' diet was
B	depending on depending on
A	but but
D	different times as well
B	the kind of food you're talking about
A	but the food is more poisoned
C	yeah I guess so
A	so it's pretty difficult to tell
D	mm
A	it's
C	I guess it's just
A	sceptical because we don't know
B	I did say cos I like argued with my
C	yeah
B	and that was like a mental disease or whatever and my mum was like she never ate very many vegetables or fruits and things like that
A	yeah I
B	and I said but up to a certain point like quite late in her life she wasn't eating much shit either
C	mm
A	yeah
B	but what she did eat growing up would've been
A	was wholefoods
B	mostly locally made and like
C	mm
A	yes it was quite varied cos she didn't have many mass-produced but it was wholefoods
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	it was wholefood packaged
B	and like manufactured process food wouldn't exist at the time it didn't exist then
A	acidity regulators whatever sugar and stuff they out in
C	mm
B	and at the point she got older she didn't like foreign stuff that
A	but I'm sure all of us in this room grew up on two bowls of breakfast cereal a day which effectively is just sugar
D	more than that
B	I didn't
A	yeah no I did I used to eat Weetos
B	but yeah
C	I
A	like two or three times a day
C	yeah I like had any
B	I had Marmite on toast but that's no better either
C	we used to have toast I've never been like a cereal person
B	yeah I
B	no me neither
A	it's what the blokes have
B	I think it's a boy thing yeah
C	and the
A	I had a lot of cereal
D	it's er more of er smokers
B	oh really?
A	cigarettes and stuff
B	oh whatever
D	yeah yeah that's it
C	I never
D	cos it's easy it's nice
B	yeah I love my toast
D	you get a free drink
B	toast is just as easy
A	yeah yeah
D	a free sugar drink
B	it is it is refreshing actually
D	a lovely sugar drink
A	and a free toy in the in the box
C	in the box
A	they used to put in the package
D	did you? oh my god
B	oh yeah yeah you would accidentally eat that shit
C	yeah
A	or they came with yours no I think it was unhygienic cos you'd always get
C	some of them did
A	one member of the family sticking their hand right
D	yeah
A	like shit wow yeah of course they didn't it's too sugary to get it all
A	I think I'd live on that
B	they need to ban some stuff
A	Fruity Loops or that sort of sugar
B	in America that shit is rife
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	I mean
B	you can get anything you can get marshmallow cookies
A	we we tried to avoid
C	I think
D	mm
A	processed food as much as possible but it's not easy it's really hard actually
B	and then we drink what we can
C	oh I know
A	like you're talking about like Iceland pretty much just to avoid frozen food like all together
C	yeah I mean it's like well
B	we eat a lot of frozen
A	I'm not saying it's a bad thing just
A	we're trying to so we've tried to for a while
C	yeah I know we should
B	I don't know we just haven't been there lately
A	we
B	but we had frozen vegetables in Korea but only cos we had to
A	only cos we had to
B	yeah
A	you couldn't buy er green beans unless they were frozen so we had to buy that we wouldn't have bought them like that if we
B	yeah
A	could just buy green beans chicken you couldn't it was so expensive to buy a fresh chicken but frozen chicken was affordable so we'd buy frozen chicken that kind of stuff
B	I guess if we went to Iceland we might find some of these things are really cheap
A	yeah they probably are
B	yeah
D	mm
C	yeah
B	I've never been to Iceland I don't know
A	the problem is like the preservatives that they put into
D	yeah it'd be ten pounds in Iceland
C	yeah that's really tentative for meat
D	meatballs meat
B	no it's
D	for chicken
B	oh yeah three for ten pounds they do that
C	yeah they do like
B	at Morrison's too
D	it's three pounds yeah
A	what was three for ten pounds?
C	like meat
D	meat
B	meat yeah
C	so you can have chicken bacon
B	like you can get a massive pack of sausages or something
C	sausages I don't know
B	yeah and that's like a week's worth of meat
D	or meatballs yeah stuff like that
B	for ten pounds
D	it's er what we do with meatballs is wicked cos we we
C	meat oh I'm like a huge I love meatballs
A	do you not make your own?
B	oh no it's what you recommend
D	ohh
C	no no no no so what you do
A	it really
C	you put them in the foil and then put them in a freezer
D	yeah
B	oh so then you need to defrost as you need
D	so then when you have to eat and then it's Saturday night and go well that's a portion for me if we're both in
C	yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	two of them
A	oh nice yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	so instead of defrosting them all
B	yeah exactly that's a good idea
A	have you ever made them?
D	no
C	er I have like once and they were a complete disaster
A	oh
C	they would just fall apart
A	they're so easy
C	yeah I know which makes it worse that I just can't
A	no I mean
D	but then they were three for ten
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	more meat
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
D	you've got chicken meat and
A	I mean that's that's just use a lot of spices and then just egg
B	they just
A	and breadcrumbs
D	mm
A	that's it
C	yeah no
B	I haven't seen this prerolled meatballs
A	and maybe mushrooms but they're
D	mm
A	no you get frozen ones and it's nice and easy it's all done but
B	no these are just fresh they've
C	yeah
D	yeah it's fresh
B	haven't you seen them with the fresh meat
A	I have yeah I have and I'm sure they're better than the ones we make but
B	I don't know if they're better it's just convenient it's easier
C	no actually it's just better to make them at the moment
D	it's just easier it's just easier
A	we make
D	they're probably better if make them cos you can put what you want in it
C	yeah you can put like
B	you make the
A	but it's it's not like we're using good meat to make with it either
D	mm
B	no exactly it's exactly
A	we get like the cheapest
D	mm it's probably
B	exactly yeah
C	I made them like every time we move I'm always like right I'm gonna go shopping in the butcher's I'm gonna go to the greengrocer's
B	no it's too expensive though
A	but it happens
C	but in a way it's but because when we were living in
B	mm
C	and I didn't really have that much money so I just bought like one but it's like it's proper it's good whole or kind of like farm bread chicken
D	mm
B	chicken
A	not battery farm
C	it's yeah it's really good it's not like ninety per cent water it's really really good so you eat it and you're really full so I had like one one chicken breast between two of us
A	yeah
B	and that was enough
C	and it was like really really filling and you have like fresh pasta for example you put fresh pasta of anything you need like this much and you're stuffed like you dry pasta and you're like a cup or more cups
A	yeah
B	oh really?
C	but er yeah it's like so much more filling
A	have you ever tried to make pasta?
B	oh we should try some fresh pasta
C	no
A	machine
B	oh has she?
A	they're good they are
C	and it's like a
A	it's that thing that you clamp on to the end of the table and you are like
C	yeah and you are like and she's got like
C	er
B	of course she has
C	in terms of the
A	this is where I this is where I failed
D	yeah
A	you said you failed on that thing I tried
B	it's still good though
A	we made gnocchi and ravioli once and it was great
D	mm
A	and then I made it again and it was a complete fucking failure and I've never made it again because it was just such a failure
C	yeah
B	yeah I bet
C	she's a phenomenal cook
B	hell yeah
D	yeah
B	I know she is
C	she's so good she's
A	is she French?
C	yeah
B	it's absorbed in her
C	it's the best thing like we'd drink at
A	yeah
C	and she literally would not let you
D	and good coffee
B	yeah
D	yeah cos her dad loves coffee so it's like
C	yeah
B	yeah oh
D	cafeteria
D	oh good treat oh fuck off
C	so good
B	I didn't remember her
A	Americans wouldn't have it any other way
C	it smells so good
D	mm
A	so what are you gonna cook us when we come over?
C	you yeah
A	what's your specialty?
B	lasagna
C	lasagna
B	meatballs
C	or a
A	that sounds perfect
C	I don't I've what was the thing I cooked
B	oh I need to go over to
C	it was like a mushroom sauce
B	I didn't
C	with parmesan and like just shit loads of veg
A	mm well let us know when you cook it and then we'll pop over
C	yeah you have to come over and eat
[ANNOTATION]	They will come when he's cooking the dish he's talking about.	Entailment
A	yeah definitely
B	well it's not just come over it's come across
D	yeah cross over
B	yeah oh yeah it depends which way ah
A	there's a curry I'd like to cook you guys at some point
B	Rendang
A	have you ever had Rendang? it's an Indonesian curry
B	you should cook everyone a Rendang
A	do you know tamarinde?
C	no sorry
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C knows a lot about tamarinde.	Contradiction
A	it's like a sweet fruit from a plant I can't really describe it's like a you get it
B	I don't know
A	in like a block of like brown sweetness it's quite common
C	okay
A	in certain countries
C	yeah
B	do you want to drink anything? now you've mentioned that
A	it's like a
[ANNOTATION]	This fruit, tamarinde, goes really well with some cheeses.	Neutral
B	it's called a curry but it's not like a curry
B	it's more like
A	coconut milk tamarinde loads it's got loads of cinammon in it and it's got loads of condomines in it so it's got that kind of sweet lemony to it
C	okay
A	it's really really good but like you put it in this coconut milk and it's really really watery we're probably not gonna do it here too often cos it's expensive but you cook it for like four hours at the lowest setting until there's no sauce left
B	sounds expensive yeah
A	so it goes really really really really thick until there's just like a really thick paste on the meat and then the end you turn it up really high and like caramalise the beef and the sauce
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	This caramalisation gives the beef a really beautiful maroon colour.	Neutral
A	it's the most flavoursome thing ever
B	and it's so good
A	do we know anything better than that?
B	no no we don't
A	it's like our favourite food but it's it's
B	oh it's salt it's not water cos
C	you need to
B	what kind of carpet doesn't absorbe stuff?
A	one that
[ANNOTATION]	If you had to choose a wine to go with this dish, speaker C would choose a red wine.	Neutral
A	there you go no mark don't have to pay anything
B	it's cos the carpet's good
C	you need to erm invest in this
A	yeah
B	yeah it's
A	go to work come back
C	it's so good yeah
B	I imagine that
[ANNOTATION]	The carpet that they have doesn't absorve liquid because it is good quality.	Entailment
A	my sausage oh yeah fucking sausage casserole
A	what?
C	he doesn't like stew
A	what?
D	mm
A	you're not British at all
C	no he's not
B	yeah what's wrong with you
D	it's too crap fuck off fucking broth
C	he doesn't like soup
B	what's wrong
C	he doesn't eat he doesn't believe in soup he says
A	he doesn't
B	what's wrong with stew though? that's all like nice party veg
C	I love stew but if you get stew
D	mm it's just broth
A	well but you know like
B	yeah
A	tomato and cream basil soup I mean what's wrong with a nice basic tomato soup?
D	yeah it's alright but
A	you don't like
C	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	so if there's a nice bread topping and I'll give you that but
D	if I was hungry I wouldn't go I'll have a soup
A	I'll have some soup
D	yeah I'll go I'll eat something more
A	pasta probably
D	more solid
C	yeah pasta or
A	does he eat that much pasta?
C	so much pasta
A	we don't eat much pasta do we?
B	what else?
A	do you eat much rice?
D	I love pasta it's I like Italian food
B	do you like bangers and mash?
D	rice yeah I'll er I'll er have rice
A	do you eat much rice? yeah
D	rice
C	no I'm back on rice now
D	you're on back rice now yeah? kinda
A	why were you off it?
C	because we what did we we were on some calorie or something
A	some diet
D	yeah something like that
C	no it was at home I had like a bag of rice and I cooked rice and I beat down on it and I fucking
A	oh my god
C	I bit down and it was like
D	it was a bit crunchy and like something was in it but I don't know if we cos it'd been
C	we threw
D	in the cupboard for a while that rice hadn't it?
C	no I'd only bought it
D	no?
C	like that week and then I didn't eat rice for ages
D	it was open though wasn't it?
B	yeah
C	cos I thought I was gonna die of some kind of like crockery-based
A	we had we had maggot in our rice didn't we? that was
C	ah
B	yeah there was maggot in our dahl dahl
A	oh it was in the dahl
B	but yeah
A	in the lentil
B	lentils
A	we still ate it
C	yeah
B	we took them out
A	if you
D	after a
A	if you bought it I'm sure it's fine
B	yeah exactly
A	well the thing is we've been in countries where they eat bugs so it's just like can't be that bad
D	yeah good source of protein bugs
B	yeah
D	it's good stuff
A	definitely puts you off we've got our friends
C	no
D	mm
A	they'd freak like mad
C	yeah no I mean unless it's
B	there weren't any
A	there were no maggots in the food tonight
B	no
A	mm
B	actually we er
A	that was the problem we had to get all of our spices and things
B	Korean called
A	from Indians
C	oh that's insane
B	and I think it was like an Indian company
A	yeah
B	that was set up and we'd buy like our meat certain meats like lamb from there which you can't buy them beef was cheaper
A	it wasn't very regulated
B	but sometimes you'd get it and you'd be like
A	I'm sure we bought beef once and it was not beef
B	oh yeah definitely it wasn't it was it may be lamb it might be mutton
B	yeah but it wasn't like beef
C	yeah
B	it was like I know the difference and this isn't quite beef we ate it anyway whatever whether it was lamb or
A	we're not picky
B	incredibly fatty I mean lamb's fatty anyway but this stuff was amazing
A	actually the lamb here is not that fatty
B	no not compared to all we had
A	no that
B	no
B	yeah yeah I don't think they grind it up
C	no
A	it affects the flavour in fact
D	yeah well I mean obviously
D	coronary heart disease is still number one killer
B	yeah
B	uhh
A	I'm not sure that comes from fat too much does it?
D	yeah so fat will clog your artery so that will lead to er
A	but the thing is there are cultures that just eat fat
D	yeah
A	pretty much people Koreans eat loads of fat
D	mm
A	but they're really thin
D	mm
A	and they don't have a particularly high rate of heart disease
B	but then they
D	no but then it all comes from erm
A	they have a high rate of stomach cancer
B	how frequently do they eat that quantity of fat then?
D	yeah
A	fat? quite often I mean any time they have any of their meats I mean
B	yeah but how often do they have
A	fairly
B	yeah but they don't go to them every I mean some of the students will go to them weekly but families though
A	but I mean every other meat they have
D	mm
A	but with three thick chunks of fat in it
B	but they're kinda what they
A	I bet you're really going to like fat I think it's really tasty but
D	mm
B	what they have in their food at home is fucking side dishes
A	when we first arrived there you go
B	with rice
A	but to say they don't eat out frequently is bullshit
B	no they do but they don't like
C	at least they
A	but I mean take the inuits
C	wow
A	inuits basically live on fat they live of like seal blubber and shit it's fat
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	they live on fat I don't think they're dying of heart disease
B	that
A	I think the problem with this is your cheap oils and your margarines and stuff I think that's what's causing heart disease
B	yeah it's the fat in everything
A	there's there's different types of fat isn't there? it's like
C	yeah there's good fats and there's bad fats
B	yeah yeah
A	I don't think the fat from an animal is bad for you I think that like fat from
C	what are the what are the fats that are bad for you?
C	are bad for you
A	well you've got
B	are the animal fats the bad fats?
D	yeah it is yeah it
B	yeah ah okay
C	I guess it's like anything it's like it's about
A	in moderation
C	yeah eating in moderation
D	yeah
C	like if you sit and eat like
D	and
A	doesn't matter yeah
D	that's basically your
A	it's a bit of a shame
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	I heard about I didn't actually watch it my friend told me about a documentary where they realised like in the eighties or something that sugar was terribly terribly bad for you
C	mm
A	like really really bad for you but at the time
D	mm
A	and then they focused on
C	mm
A	and it's what you're saying is
D	no
A	like depends how many calories you're eating now fat is highly calorific so you're getting a lot of energy for what you're eating but
C	ah
A	we need to plump up a bit for the winter so apparently when you have sugary fruits and sugary foods your body puts on weight to store it for the winter but now we're eating these things at all times of the year and they they're very acidic and they're causing a lot of kind of problems for people
D	I think it comes from further back than that even in in
A	yeah
D	so
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah you didn't
D	in excess but then obviously if your
B	yeah
D	mostly it would
A	what do you think about the
D	yeah
C	yeah yeah yeah
A	theory that fasting generates more
D	yeah yeah
A	it may be cheaper
D	yeah it's cheaper but then it's just
C	I don't necessarily think it's
D	trying
B	yeah exactly
C	mm
B	it's a very dangerous thing isn't it?
D	so it's yeah it's difficult
A	but theoretically and I understand the theory behind it
B	it depends what you eat
A	if your body is not receiving food it's gonna have to step up a gear
D	yeah
C	yeah I don't know
B	yeah it's quite erm
A	and also apparently again
C	digest
A	and do all this kind of stuff so
C	I don't know I mean like
D	the thing that's best is to have a balance diet
C	yeah like
B	yeah
C	I think that the thing is it depends on what you eat
D	like that depends what you're doing like with athletes
D	obviously they need a large amount of calories so
A	meat
D	even a smaller amount of
A	proteins
D	and a
A	beans
D	cos you need fats obviously to break down stuff
A	lentils
B	yeah
A	protein foods
D	but the majority of diets should be fruit and veg
B	yeah
C	the thing is as well with like those kind of
D	for the average person
C	like fasting diets as well is the psychology behind them as well because if you know that say that
D	you're just gonna starve for two days you're gonna starve for two days
C	tomorrow you're gonna starve for two days you're gonna eat more
A	you'll eat more before
C	and so you're probably gonna be
B	oh yeah yeah
A	you'll just end up with the same amount of calories
B	yeah yeah and you're
C	yeah you're not gonna
B	you're and like in our culture you're going to a shop and you'll be like well I can't eat this and this and this which is terrible
A	it doesn't matter whatever yeah
D	mm
C	yeah you're just
D	it's not most most the
B	you're not gonna grab anything from the shelf
D	anyway like
B	it's like going through a
D	if you're being good you overestimate if you're being bad you underestimate it's what
C	yeah
D	most of us does
B	yeah
D	so you get up and run mile and say oh I must've burned off two hundred calories or whatever so now I can eat all this and then if you're eating well we go
C	it doesn't make sense
D	but then you're overestimating the good stuff and underestimating the bad stuff
A	yeah I never
B	yeah

C	mm
A	when yeah that's why you say half
D	half castle
C	yeah yeah
D	grass
C	but then I sound like
D	grass
C	I've got
D	there's an R in it
C	no I'm really bad there's so much I've kind of
C	I used to have a really thick accent when I first met
A	path grass bath
C	bath and everything
A	what do you call that bread thing that you eat with that little round kind of shape?
C	a roll
A	do you call it a roll? not a bap or a cob or a
C	no no no no no I wasn't that
C	I wasn't that far north
C	that's like Midlands
A	where is that?
C	just the Midlands
A	and it's Birmingham
C	yeah and it's Birmingham but it's just
A	it's not far from Bedford really
A	Beford is about forty minutes from from Birmingham so
C	yeah
D	it's border with er Wales
C	it's
A	oh okay so you're on that side
C	yeah so
A	not too far from Scotland er not too far from Liverpool sorry
C	yeah no still quite far like about an hour? hour and a half from Liverpool
A	yeah I thought Liverpool was right near the north tip of Wales isn't it?
C	no Liverpool is like lots further up from that
D	it's just the bit up from er
A	is it? excuse me
C	I think
A	cool
C	nothing happened erm
A	I shall pardon myself
C	yeah no it's not it's not a million miles away
A	always
C	but we always had we it was really strange when we lived there everyone was like wow you sound like so London you're so London and then when we came back here everyone was like where the fuck are you from? like
A	yeah
C	what the hell is this? like
B	who's this new girl?
C	yeah
B	who's this new girl who
C	but then it was only yeah but
C	he used to watch like Coronation Street for like nostalgia to try and like
C	like everything sounded normal when he watched Coronation Street
A	that's depressing
C	yeah right
D	he used to correct himself a lot
C	yeah
D	I mean do you want anything from the shop?
C	from the shop?
A	do you want
C	do you want
D	do you want
C	got money
C	it's weird how like cos we like the more north you go it seems like the whole language just completely changes
D	mm
C	but
A	give us a cutch
C	yeah give us a cutch and stuff like that but then that was kind of er you know that was kind of it it wasn't really
A	well the far north has a lot more of a north influence doesn't he?
C	it wasn't bad yeah
A	it's more like Nordic kind of language
B	and it depends who colonised you
A	yeah it's definitely different there're places you know like modal verbs
C	oh okay
A	so like we say erm I can swim yeah?
D	mm
A	but in certain parts of Scotland apparently they use double modals so they can say like I would could swim or I shall will be able to do it
B	or even in Yorkshire
D	mm
A	they put two together so like I can will do it or I should may be able to do it or something
C	oh that's so weird
A	it's weird isn't it?
C	I'd never heard of that
A	so weird
D	mm
C	that's so strange
A	yeah I've only read about that
C	the same that like if you get like a real thick Scottish accent I haven't got a clue
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	he could be saying anything
C	yeah
B	the first time that I
C	no idea
B	the first time that we truly experienced that we were in Indonesia and there was this couple that was sitting like
A	it's Philippines
B	old couple
A	Philippines
B	oh was it in the Philippines? sorry this old couple that was across the table and I was like wonder where they're from? and we were just next to them and we listened
A	I couldn't tell where he was from at all he was Scottish
B	listen and it wasn't until he
D	mm
A	couldn't understand if he was speaking Dutch or something
B	for the third time tried to communicate to the waiter
A	cos they didn't understand him either
B	obviously the waiter couldn't understand him but eventually
A	okay mate where's the fucking something or other
B	but no it wasn't even like that it was just like he didn't like he made himself understood and I could tell at that point he was Scottish but then he turned back to his wife and they started talking again and it was crazy like I've never come across an accent
A	I mean effectively
B	it wasn't
A	at that point
B	it's not an accent
A	the definition of well it's a different language actually
B	yeah
A	the definition of a language is er is it are we speaking the same language? the answer is is it mutually intelligible?
D	mm
A	can I understand you? if I can understand you it's the same language it's just a different dialect when it comes to Scottish that thick I couldn't understand him it's effectively a different language
B	yeah
A	because I can't understand it
B	yeah wherever he was from they were from
A	can't understand
B	it was insane
C	yeah some people do
B	yeah
C	and I've no idea like
B	no yeah just a few things
C	I can work out certain things but like you know erm
C	well just kind of general
C	you literally some of them I don't understand like people will be talking and I've no idea
B	idea what they're saying
C	and the other thing I hate about cockney rhyming slang is sometimes when you really like when you get someone who's like a dedicated cockney
D	cockney rhymer
C	cockney rhymer
C	if you have like apples and pears
B	yeah
C	they won't call it like they'll be like er we're not the apples and pears they'll just call it
C	yeah like the apples or the pears and I'm no no no that's not rhyming
B	yeah yeah no no you're just shorten it even down
C	you're just taking no you're just calling it a different word
D	mm
C	that's not an apple that's just stairs
B	yeah
C	and that's when I'm
B	even so in
C	yeah you're
D	mm
C	of cockney rhyming slang now you're just cockney now I just don't understand what you're talking about at all
B	yeah
D	it's just rhyming words
B	George and trent
C	ten
B	bent
C	bent?
B	my dad calls gay people George and trend I'm like
C	well I guess if it's almost what's called George and what's called trend
B	yeah yeah
C	probably
B	yeah I guess that's what I think that's what he said he's
A	what's that?
B	and he was like they were George and trent or something I
A	it's just your dad's sayings
B	no but that's rhyming slang that's not the people
A	your dad speaks
B	it's a mixture of the two which makes it more misintelligible er unintelligible or something like that
D	well what's the thing we watched that show?
C	oh my god the Indian
B	yeah
D	it's Indians you know it's like Indians in India teaching other Indians how to speak the Austalian dialect
D	but they're obviously yeah all Australian
B	oh that's brilliant
D	so then erm
B	Indians teaching Indians an Australian accent
D	it's so so much shit but they've got a cockatil or something and they call it
D	fuck off fuck off
B	fuck off chopper
D	he's obviously very fluent in Australian
D	and they were saying about all every Australian has a nickname and usually it's a shortening name of their names it's like this is George Boonie his his nickname's Boonie
D	like they give all
B	you alright Boonie?
B	it's some shit
B	yeah that's pretty
B	swear all the time yeah you don't wanna do that
B	when we swear
D	mm
B	in some Indian accent
D	I had
B	yeah yeah I do
D	found it on Youtube there's a series of them some I quite liked
B	I had a student in Korea and he er he he it's really unusual he'd er he's only about twenty but he went to India for a couple of years
D	mm
B	like to work on a Korean international school there and he's just basically to
D	mm
B	obviously they speak quite good English but he came back with an Indian accent his English was really
D	mm
B	strange like in my class cos if anything they're gonna have a Korean accent or they're gonna have some weird American accent
D	mm
B	but he
D	was he was he Japanese or Korean or
B	Yorkshire accent they do yeah yeah that's exactly what had happens it's really weird
B	yeah
D	it would probably be very funny to speak to somebody who looks Asian but
C	he spoke really
B	with a Yorkshire
D	funny
B	yeah it definitely happens you can tell when they
D	mm who they've picked up English from
B	if they have if they've lived somewhere in England
D	mm
B	you can tell when they have lived there
A	within a month of us teaching them they say water and this kind of stuff
D	mm
A	the first year it really throws them off
D	mm
B	ah
A	they're like water?
B	sometimes
D	mm mm
B	they don't really seem
A	water
C	water
B	we did have some students
D	there was I met some guy from Romania who learned English from the Cartoon Network
C	yeah Nickelodeon
D	Nickeolodeon something like that that shit
B	yeah yeah yeah
C	most did it
B	yeah it's the same in even in Holland I think
D	but then who they live with
C	yeah
D	like English
B	like with an English accent yeah
C	yeah it was like
D	yeah so he learned and when we first met him we thought he was English
C	yeah
B	yeah
D	he was like no he's from Romania
C	you must be
B	oh was that
C	yeah like
B	ah
C	he's best friend with
B	yeah oh right his best friend
C	he had like but he literally had
D	he sounded like us
C	exactly the same
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	like you couldn't you couldn't tell
C	and
B	he's just
A	do you remember where they were from then
C	Bucharest
A	Bucharest
B	oh right yeah
C	erm
C	and he was like I fucking learned English
C	and then he started speaking Romanian and I was like wow his Romanian's really good for an English person
A	that is a good English
D	but then I think I
C	he was he was fucking phenomenal
D	could tell there was a bit of er he didn't obviously speak like us but it wasn't
D	would you like a cup of tea?
C	hello would you like a cup of tea?
B	yeah yeah he was
C	would you like a cup of tea?
B	our friend er
D	was that
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	mate mate no mate no mate
D	the first day the first two people I met on my Masters degree one of them was er Greek Cypriot
C	yeah
D	and the other one was Irish and I went out drinking with them and
C	Scottish yeah and then like
B	no that's embarrassing
C	and then like erm ah fuck what's his name?
D	from Spain
A	I am
B	from Spain
A	yes from Spain
D	yeah he talked for about ten minutes
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	well it's the same

D	yeah cos it was oh
C	no he was from Seville he was yeah because he said

D	oh alright
C	and then he was spoke about it he actually was like
B	ahh
C	the village next to where I stayed when I was in Spain
C	was like the village above
D	mm
C	or wherever it was but erm
D	he didn't speak very good the reason he came over was to learn English
C	he was terrible
B	yeah same
D	because in Spain you have to speak a certain level of English
C	it was so bad
D	to do a PhD
B	yeah PhD yeah
D	and that was he had two Masters degees he had
C	he was so smart
D	he'd done so much work but if he couldn't speak good English he couldn't do a PhD in Spain so they
C	it was so funny
D	but obviously he's so smart but couldn't understand a fucking word of anything
C	so you used to go and be like are you okay? and he would be like
D	but then someone
C	he just kind of like smiled at me for
D	he started teaching us Spanish so we learned

B	yeah yeah
C	it was just
D	all getting pissed up as well
C	everyone was really drunk so everyone's accents were getting thicker and when I get drunk my accent gets more like posh and northern so er no one really knows going on with my accent
A	that's a naughty one is it posh and northern?
C	yeah posh and northern
A	yeah
C	like maybe I don't know like a London socialite that's moved to like Yorkshire for a while to have some like time out
B	that's
C	erm no
B	where's Downton Abbey from?
C	probably the South Downs or something like that

B	er whatever
D	yeah we've got that we've got quite a lot of accents and dialects
B	mm
C	yeah
A	guy isn't it great? seriously we're on about six hours so it's really fantastic
C	oh
B	but we haven't been here that long
A	erm
C	we got here at half four
A	I think it may be longer this thing has actually stopped and gone to another track
D	yeah
A	so we may have done seven hours
B	yeah yeah yeah we haven't been talking that long
C	no way
A	they arrived at about five
C	half four five
D	yeah it's gone twelve

C	oh fuck
B	no it hasn't
A	it's twelve it's midnight
B	really?

D	no I said it was twenty to nine
C	well like eight nine
B	mm
C	fuck
B	you've got to work tomorrow
C	yeah not till eleven
D	and I've got to drive home yeah
C	I'm really in the library I'm gonna go hide hide in the library
B	ah
C	it's quiet yeah
B	yeah
C	I was saying that they do like things
B	but when is the quiet time? libraries are shush
C	it was different I know it's not all of the time
B	is that any library or
C	street libraries get really prolific but
B	ah
C	but every library does it
B	so when you say you're in the library working do you just mean any library or the library in
C	no no no so when I say working doing my dissertation in the library
B	yeah
C	I was in the library either in
B	oh okay so you use the places yeah yeah yeah
C	and so I just work there
D	I've told you
C	erm but because
B	yeah I remember the department yeah yeah
C	so I don't think I'm really meant to use it but
B	I'm sure you can it doesn't matter
C	I've
B	yeah yeah you do too
C	but erm
B	oh wow
C	yeah I know it's insane and he was like how much are these? no he was like do you take card? and I was like oh I think we do but I don't I can't do card payments
D	you borrow them you need to bring them
C	they're free? and I was like yeah you borrow them and then you bring them back after like an alotted period of time he was like
A	where was he from?
C	he was from
C	I know and he literally
C	looked like he looked thrown away
A	wow
C	like he looked so happy and these kids were
A	wow
C	like so does that mean more than one book? I was like you can have up to like thirty books if you've got a library account and these kids just like
B	anything complimented thing
C	never obviously been in a library
B	thought they were going into a bookshop
A	well he thought he was in a bookshop yeah
C	I guess he just thought they
B	oh bless those kids like having to choose from all these books
A	mm
C	I know but what I what I say is that
A	and even then when he came to buy them he didn't have the money to buy them
B	yeah no exactly
C	yeah no even then
A	even though he didn't know how much it cost
D	yeah
B	he
B	ah I wonder if he will ever return these books
C	he will would he probably will
D	he'll probably be back every week
C	and then he will come after me
D	they'll be like fuck you can just take them for a while and bring them back
C	yeah
B	yeah it's true
C	in fact
C	steal stuff and then return it until your
B	and finish
C	it's completely amazing yeah it was really weird
B	yeah
C	and he I
A	must've felt quite nice though to to give that nice gift to that man
C	yeah it was like it was amazing
D	mm
C	but then I kinda felt like I just like mugged him off a little bit because everyone knows libraries are free but I thought like I'm giving him this amazing gift of free books but everyone gets it
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah it's true
C	it's just not about a card it's about
A	you're a
C	yeah I know
A	they're the simple things with some people
C	yeah it's amazing
B	er well if his children benefit from it then it's lovely
A	it's nice to teach children
B	he he managed to get them into a library
C	mm
B	it's just quite magical for a guy
C	loads of kids like library students
D	and
B	to understand what a library is
B	yeah yeah
C	and he's always trying to get kids in and they do like lego
B	they do summer er
C	after school and summer
B	summer programmes and stuff
C	yeah
B	I recommend that they do
C	yeah they have to
B	oh okay oh
D	I think it's bullshit
C	it's ridiculous so if you like meet
B	they need terminology
C	a person who's like oh I'd like to go to the library you'll never go find a library because it's not called a library it's called a hub
C	well you can use yeah you can use things that you can remember but but also it's like you you're paying
C	parking fines council tax they're literally like no
B	no what?
C	joke it's so bad and then
B	they're making it into like a city centre then
C	yeah with books erm but the worst thing is it's like there's like a first contact point
D	mm
C	woh hang on let me join this queue so they start at the queue and just like take back a library book and then they're like no you don't do that here there's the library
B	they need to signpost that
C	it's just so bad but you have to
D	you have to pay
B	yeah
C	there're certain things that they're saying that like you have to all like certain books I think it's either discharge or return that they have to go to the contact point but then some not
B	mm
C	made it carry on with being a library
D	it was just cos
C	and then
B	pay the difference
D	you have the whole thing
C	yeah
D	the er
C	a big world or
D	it's society
C	society
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	was it cos of that? cos they're trying to say it's not a library
B	no cos they want libraries
C	no
D	it's this so we can still employ librarians and stuff?
C	no because
B	mm
C	but it is hard it's not like if it was that easy then anyone would do it I guess right? all librarians
B	yeah
A	being a librarian?
C	so so yeah so that's why now like
B	it's not that easy
C	you will never you'll never get a volunteering job as a librarian
B	mm
C	that once they send one in then like loads of people come in then eventually the government will just be well hang on these volunteers are doing your job
B	we don't need to pay anyone to do anything anymore
C	you don't need to pay anyone to do it so you can and that's
B	is this
C	no well
D	the taxes go to everyone so no you pay taxes
C	no no no it's like
B	it's not a private company is it? I'm sure
D	you pay taxes towards it you should be able to go and get a book if you wanna read a fucking book
B	mm
C	but libraries are like they do like amazing
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
D	yeah
C	things but the problem is with libraries is this they're kind of like
A	yeah
C	incredibly updated with like the internet and eBooks and everything like it's
B	this is why they now have to call it the hub
C	yeah which is why they probably now have to call it
D	mm
C	the hub
A	so in the future we're going to have hubs rather than libraries
B	rather than promote libraries for what they give for
C	yeah maybe in the future like now
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	tomorrow
C	like tomorrow yeah some poor like traveller who's just trying to find a library to find out what the bus times is or something they're never gonna find it cos they need to find a hub and no one knows
A	they're really strict about signing up I
D	mm
A	my mum's a member can I you know I'll just get her card and then I'll do no no no if you need to do the photocopying then you need a card
C	on no that's not yeah
A	no no no but my mum's got a card
D	mm
A	I'll just use her card
D	mm
A	and I'll photocopy no no no you need a card you can't do photocopying on her card
D	mm
A	well if she's doing photocopying for you we can't allow that so
C	yeah but that's just
D	and and and how will you know that?
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	she's
C	that's erm
D	mm
C	someone is being unethical
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly
D	yeah
A	I agree with you being a wanker
B	exactly
C	we had erm well when I was working in
C	and there was a guy who came and photographed er photocopied sorry his passport sent it off somewhere and apparently you're not allowed to
B	oh
C	you
A	how else do you photocopy your passport?
B	whatever yeah
C	but this woman that I was working with was an absolute twat like a complete job's worth if I
C	for being just a complete knob
B	yeah
C	but erm

C	yeah I'm not
A	no okay this is this is the real problem
B	you don't look
A	this is the real problem I have a place for everything I know where my things go
C	yeah I know that's the thing
A	I feel like she does it for games or something like do you know what I mean?
A	like she goes oh I think I'll put his pin here like you know
B	no that's not true
B	no no but it's not true when you're directly looking at something which you do
A	no I've admitted I've
B	every single day that you don't
A	I've admitted to not moving
B	finding other things
A	things to look for things but the fact of the matter is I know where I put shit
C	yeah I know
A	so if I'm like it's not here and I don't put it anywhere else you've done it where is it? like give it back to me
C	yeah I'm
B	it's not true
D	you do that but you
C	I'm
A	it's like you used it
C	actually you
D	you were where is it? where is it? have you seen it? where is it?
D	well I've put in here I've put it in here? it's not here so you must've touched it
C	that's why but but you don't
B	that's exactly what he said
A	yeah yeah
D	why why would I touch it? and then where was it? in your other place
C	but why would I no
B	you've touched it and then we find it and you're fucking
A	but it is no it's not in my stuff we all where do we where do we find stuff? always
B	so
A	like in your scenario she just hasn't found it but
B	no whatever
A	in my scenario it's you have put it somewhere oh it's under this bin under here
B	nine times out of ten it's
A	you're twisting history again
B	it's not in my drawer and I open the drawer and I lift it out
A	I'm not gonna lie you have definitely found stuff when I I've been looking for it and
B	nine times out of ten
A	but
B	definitely well I'm not gonna document this shit
C	yeah it's recorded
A	I said that every time
C	this is technically now a
B	yeah
A	yeah you will
C	some edits but it'll be fine
A	yeah there's yeah I'll go back and do that
C	a couple of edits
A	what are you about to do with that? do not put that in your ear
B	yeah why
C	no I don't know
D	it's just cos then they leak off and so I like to clean it before every time I top it up clean it up
A	that's fair
D	to stop it leaking cos it's horrible
A	I don't trust them I don't think cigarettes are good
B	ah yeah that's probably what's been happening to us when we tried other people's and they just haven't taken that out
A	you're not meant to drink it it's toxic so you're meant to smoke it?
C	oh
B	I feel like we like get like perfume sprayed in our mouths when we've tried it before
A	it's disgusting
B	it's horrible
C	yeah sounds pretty horrible
A	it's been like spicy liquid that
B	but yeah
C	it's okay I guess it kinda does the job
B	yeah
A	oh no yeah
B	can you smoke them on a plane?
C	yeah no you're not meant to
A	you
B	you can't smoke it on a
C	no
A	it's been really harsh about it
B	why?
A	cos it's like
D	cos they're like
A	they don't like to look at the what was what was it?
C	well er I
D	well I I think the only thing I can think is cos obviously they can look out if they see smoke puffing off somewhere they know they can come over and say get the fuck out
C	yeah
A	even if they
D	rather than taking a second step to that what are you smoking? oh it's one whatever
B	but you can smell cigarettes
C	mm
A	exactly you can smell this
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	yeah
A	maybe you could just go he goes yeah
D	mm yeah I don't know I don't know much about it to be honest
C	yeah no I know but
D	but
C	it's I don't understand it
A	well you seem very good about it for someone who vapes I'd be more pissed
C	well I don't know
D	yeah I don't really care they treat you like you're smoking cigarette anyway it's
C	yeah I guess it's like
B	I guess it's pretty much the same for
D	it's similar so all I'm doing is missing a
C	yeah you have to smoke outside so
A	well that's better than er having the
D	mm
B	there you go
A	the trick is to quit which is phenomenally difficult
D	mm
C	yeah it's a weird one
D	it's good to have when you're er drinking
C	yeah
D	that's the point
D	mm
B	yeah yeah yeah

D	mm
A	with TV people that you watch a lot of
