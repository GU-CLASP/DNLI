D	he was really looking forward it?
A	yeah
D	and she
B	he's reliving his childhood
C	oh man
A	but yeah
A	we're definitely gonna make it again
B	I think like

A	fat and
C	I
C	yeah man
A	what did it have in it?
D	tuna
C	tuna
C	why why is it again you can't have lavender bread in
A	because they had to leave in such a rush
C	that's it
A	didn't have time to let it rise
C	kosher
A	kosher
C	really? wow
C	but surely you can have like like normal flatbreads cos they only take like three minutes to cook right?
A	yeah
C	do the matzah cracker people just have a total monopoly over Passover?
A	probably
C	yeah
B	they had them in the
A	and they
C	cos that's the thing that you get like
A	all that food is like blessed by rabbi's in the warehouse
C	oh of course it has to be blessed
A	so a rabbi'll go around like muttering and down the
B	that's it
C	yeah yeah yeah
D	you'd go crazy working there if it's just sped up recordings all day
B	mm
A	happened when you went to the factory there?
B	just read about it
A	is halal is it similar to kosher?
B	yeah
D	yeah well the blessing and you know the
B	it's just for like the killing of animals
D	yeah
B	so kosher just sounds like it's crazy like like from the beginning
A	yeah
B	like how long things are cooked for
A	well boil three eggs at a time only
B	only only three
C	no I think halal refers to lots of other aspects of normal life as well
A	yeah
C	they're just guide books
B	you might be right I don't know
A	I think I think you'd go totally mental though following all the rules
C	yeah
A	did you watch that documentary about like finding love in Stamford Hill?
C	no that sounds cool
A	there's like this one like
D	the son?
A	no the father

B	take evasion
A	they they go to Israel and he finds one in Israel
C	oh
A	and they're like yeah it's like yeah she likes you she likes you she wants to go and have another date
C	so crazy
A	his other son found out why
C	erm
A	must
B	is it nice the
A	yeah it's weird it's kinda funny though

A	yeah
C	whatever but they had this thing where firstly they make have to make love to a sheet with a hole in
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
C	yeah
A	I thought you said sheep
