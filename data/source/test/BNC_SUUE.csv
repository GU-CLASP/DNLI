A	mm
B	it's not like you're doing a nice little
A	that's so hard
B	and family
A	so hard
B	yeah security just doesn't exist anymore
A	that's why I got out of it
B	right
A	documentaries
B	right
A	I
A	I couldn't stomach it
A	that I was looking for the money
B	yeah
A	then when I get the money I'll make something
B	yeah
A	and then I was
B	yeah
A	but after a while it was kind of getting a bit of a drag you know? and then I met my future husband
B	yeah
A	and then I thought well no I want something where I can contribute more
B	mm
A	you know so
B	how long did you
A	I did it for well I got my film degree in two thousand and two
B	right
A	then I went and did
B	mm
A	so I did some training first
B	mm
A	and then studied it thinking that would help you know to make the contacts
B	yeah
A	as you say networks and everything
B	yeah
A	but it doesn't change the system
B	right he's he's lucky
A	right
B	he he's come up from

A	yeah
B	it's not
A	no
B	yeah
A	you're right

A	and it's intense
B	oh yeah
A	and it's often that you lose out to somebody who isn't particularly any better than you but it's a political you know?
B	I mean
A	nepotistic kind of
B	once his contract finishes
A	no
B	yes
A	yeah
B	bless him

B	he
A	yeah
B	for what he what he did he's getting good money
A	yeah which is
B	yeah
A	it's danger money in a way
A	well it cos it's completely balmy job if you think about it directing is just completely mental

B	yeah
A	yeah just so much fun
B	however
A	working hard playing hard
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	however you know it it couldn't sustain it
A	yeah
B	so I had to make a decision
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yeah
B	you know I'm not
B	I'm like I'm a wannabe
A	but then also in a way you your band like you didn't wanna be on Top Of The Pops either? like you could've in a way
B	yeah
A	but maybe it wasn't that important to you
B	I
A	yeah okay
B	but when you get the underground hits they're like
A	yeah
B	pirate labels or white labels
A	that's right yeah yeah
B	you know?
A	people like them
B	yeah it's
A	yeah
B	that's right
A	it's more for the joy than other things
B	mm absolutely
A	yeah
B	so I had to I had the I decided that
A	mm
B	my my my partner at the time business partner at the time
B	and he was he was going we were going opposite ways
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	so I took myself back to
A	wow
B	and er
A	that must've been a life changing event as well
B	I thoroughly
A	yeah
B	you know really really kind of you
A	what were these
B	erm
A	okay
B	and that was kinda split down the middle
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	we had we had a mixture
A	yeah
B	we had
A	yeah
B	young
A	yeah
B	the ones that don't
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah exactly attracts a lot of foreign students yeah
B	yeah
A	it's a good community
B	it was quite it was quite quite mixed
A	yeah
B	quite mixed
A	it's good that
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I I I I I loved it
A	yeah
B	yet yet again a life changing experience and
A	yeah
B	something we wanted to do
A	yeah yeah so what did you study then?
B	yeah
A	wow
B	yeah
A	that's
B	yeah
A	that's kinda quite
B	yeah
A	quite dry in a way like different from
B	it was
A	the arts like
B	well
A	just
B	it was
B	it was
A	yeah
B	it was
B	but it's one of them things
B	cos in
A	yeah
B	and I got talking to someone and they said like you know this degree is quite a broad degree
A	mm
B	yeah?
A	mm that's nice yeah
B	and then you know it's a good base
A	yeah it's a good base
B	cos cos
A	yeah
B	in what direction you wanna go
A	too true
B	and
A	that's amazing
B	because
A	yeah
B	that that same degree I've got into paralegal with that degree
A	seriously?
B	yeah
A	wow
B	you know?
A	yeah it's how you
B	it's not
A	yeah
B	how you sell it
B	yeah? how you sell it
A	cos I did paralegal work as well
B	oh did you?
A	yeah
A	but you're right because I had a business studies degree you know how they
B	yeah
A	and you're right you could pick and choose like a smorgasbord
B	yeah
A	to put that legal hat on you go yeah I did law at
B	that's right
A	my part of
B	that's that's right
A	and they go alright give you a job as a paralegal
A	you know? and then and then you could be anyone in a way
B	yeah
A	you could put all different hats on
B	absolutely
A	cos that's great
B	cos that cos that all depends on how you how you
A	mm
B	cos I didn't know I was gonna
A	mm
B	you know? I
A	yeah
B	in law
A	it's something your
B	I
A	brain
B	you know it was a dream
B	it was like it was a dream you know?
A	it's a dream
B	yeah
A	to be a lawyer
B	I thought maybe that I was gonna
A	it's a big aspiration to have yeah
B	but when I started to do some of those units
A	yeah
B	I thought
A	it killed me
A	and you know they also say that erm
A	to study law is fantastic
B	right
A	because as a lawyer you're trained to think
B	right
A	to cover your client
B	mm
A	so you're always looking at the negative side
B	yeah
A	of what can happen
B	mm
A	to practice it
B	really?
unknown_female	and the
A	thank you
unknown_female	dressing's over there if you want salad
A	okay
unknown_female	okay
A	thank you
B	no
A	yeah
B	but it I mean I enjoyed
A	yeah
B	so I enjoyed going through the journey
A	yeah
B	and knowing that
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	and knowing that it's not rocket science really
A	no it's not
B	you know? they do their research and pick up the latest
A	yeah
B	and
A	you can just do it
B	and er
A	yeah
B	law is constantly evolving and changing
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah that's true
B	well
A	mm mm
B	I decided that I I certain contacts in living in
A	mm mm
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	and er
A	mm mm
B	and then
A	yeah
B	we sort of talked from last time
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	so that is like my
A	mm
B	and er
A	true
B	cos
A	yeah
B	in uni it ain't gonna happen
B	ain't gonna happen
A	and they don't really tell you that either
B	no
A	mm
B	you gotta have thick skin
A	mm
B	and you really gotta have a love for working within the functional like
A	yeah
B	young people
A	yeah
B	so
A	yeah
B	and it and it wasn't it wasn't
A	yeah
B	like work
A	it's like a calling or something
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	wow
B	I done that for about
A	uhu
B	then
A	yeah
B	it's it's not intense for me
A	yeah
A	right
B	you you know?
A	it's part of living?
B	I dunno if because maybe I come from a really big family
A	right
B	I come from a really big family there's seven of us and it was always a very vibrant household
A	uhu
B	with something going on
A	uhu
B	so working in that environment and having sort of like young kids
A	yeah
B	you know it it it
A	was the norm for you?
B	it it didn't it didn't faze me
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	would get fazed
A	mm
B	didn't faze me
A	mm
B	you know you know I wasn't fazed by it cos er
A	mm mm
B	have been failed by have been failed somewhere along in their lives
A	mm
B	you know by their parents
A	mm mm
B	mum dad
A	mm mm
B	you know they they
A	so it's not their fault?
B	they've been failed
A	yeah
B	and er a lot of them really are very very needy
A	mm
B	so
A	they just wanna be loved really isn't it?
B	absolutely
A	yeah
B	and
A	like we all do
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you know?
A	mm
B	and I was able to offer them
A	mm mm
B	in all these different areas
A	mm
B	I was able to offer them
A	yeah
B	you know if they're interested into music
A	mm mm
B	the arts singing drama
A	you can encourage this
B	yeah
B	so it was it was it was a
A	mm
B	they're just going trying to find out
A	mm
B	so I found that I was very very comfortable there
A	mm mm
B	because they're not gonna
A	yeah
B	and somehow like they've looked at it
A	yeah
B	and either move on
A	yeah
B	or take it further
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	know what the possibilities are even
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	to taste that
A	yeah exactly
B	you know?

A	mm
B	and I've all you know so
A	yeah
B	I'm going with the flow here
A	mm

A	yeah
B	so I
A	mm mm
B	er it was called
A	mm mm
B	and that was
A	yes very important project then?
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and it was basically delivered right across
A	mm mm
B	er in every borough
A	wow
A	what a great experience
B	yeah
A	though
B	yeah
A	being able to implement something like that
B	yeah
A	and how did it go?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so experimental?
B	cos
A	yeah
B	coming from the Home Office
A	yeah
B	it was targeting young people geographically in deprived areas
A	mm
B	er it was
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah
B	so I was working in partnership with the youth offending team
A	mm mm
B	er
A	mm mm
B	football basketball
A	mm mm
B	underpinned with an education programme
A	mm mm
B	you know?
A	mm mm
B	so
A	mm
B	you know?
A	sounds like you were putting on these different kind of you know events and trying to make them into
B	well absolutely
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm mm
B	then I went for a promotion
A	mm
B	er
A	yeah
B	of the
A	mm mm
B	at at the time
A	mm mm
B	and er
A	mm
B	of the all the youth centres
A	ah
B	yeah
A	how many were there?
A	mm
B	then you had like satellites
A	okay
B	yeah?
A	mm mm
B	so then you you might have
A	mm mm
B	you know? with like hubs
A	mm mm
B	you know? so the main hub would like
A	wow that's a big job
B	yeah
A	was it was it quite frantic though quite like? buzzing around trying to
B	well
A	go to these different centres trying to?
B	well
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	er
A	yeah
B	you go out and and and see what the problem is
A	yeah
B	supervision
A	yeah
B	find out what's going on
A	yeah
B	staffing problems
A	yeah
B	you know you you you're constantly
A	mm
B	always the
A	mm
B	always a challenge
A	did you think the primary managers were competent? in their jobs?
B	well
A	mm
B	was a a change of ethos
A	right
B	you had like a lot of the old school
A	right
B	who
A	yeah
B	really couldn't identify with the pace of where
A	yeah
B	wanted to take them
A	and that happens
B	yeah
A	yeah people get replaced
B	yeah
A	new people
B	absolutely
A	mm
B	you know it's you you
A	yeah
B	it's very very very very difficult
A	so you have to really try to influence them
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	training
A	mm
B	you know
A	mm
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and my I I try to bring them along with me
A	mm
B	and
A	mm
B	because they're used to the old school
A	yeah
B	of doing what they want when they want
A	yeah
B	and and taking the P
A	yeah
A	is that the only other route? it's the only
B	well
A	right okay
B	you know? you know you reach out to them
A	yeah
B	numerous occasions
A	yeah and if they turn you down
B	yeah but but you reach out to them and and you don't communicate what you're doing
A	yeah
B	so you can't
A	mm
B	to reach out to the individual
A	mm
B	and you constantly reach out and you're training
A	mm
B	you know?
A	mm
B	well no
B	are they incompetent?
A	yeah
B	yeah?
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	yeah? and you can't
A	no
B	on
A	rather
B	you know?
A	like you have you have to really persuade and argue and
B	that's right
A	encourage and
B	you know
B	well that's well this is the skill of the
A	mm it is
B	you know that's not everyone's cut out to be a manager
A	and I think maybe all of your different experiences from before
B	yeah
A	I mean not to say that you were fake or insincere in your role
B	no
A	but it certainly helps
B	mm
A	when you're
B	yeah
A	you know your
B	mm mm
A	yeah
B	I I I I
A	yeah
B	but I do think
A	yeah they do
B	yeah but they no
A	there's some people who wanna do bad in this world
B	I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm from that perspective
A	yeah
B	everybody
A	me too
B	wants to do good
A	I believe in that
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	even the person that is doing bad
A	mm
B	they'll justify it in their head
A	why they're doing it
B	that's right
A	yeah
B	mm?
A	yeah
B	so as I'm
A	yeah
B	as I'm I'm I'm
A	mm
B	everybody wants to do good
A	mm
B	so when they're doing something
A	mm
B	which is not right
A	mm
A	mm
B	you know what's going on?
A	mm
B	why are you choosing?
A	mm this pathway
B	that
A	yeah
B	and like I try to explore explore that with them
A	mm
B	because
A	yeah
B	to a loving wife
A	yeah
B	you know?
A	yeah
B	it
A	yeah
B	you know? everyone
A	yeah
B	so
A	unconditionally if possible
B	if someone chooses
A	yeah
B	if someone chooses to do something evil
A	yeah
B	or
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	well
A	mm
B	personal development
A	I love that too
B	yeah?
A	that is totally my area
A	I just maybe I've come to a different
B	right
