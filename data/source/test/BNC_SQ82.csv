A	knowing our luck
B	isn't it your point though?
A	sorry
B	what you were saying earlier like you're not even allowed to say anything
A	I know
B	this this is it's not a I don't think it's a
A	yes
B	rather than a study of cultural beliefs
A	they're not supposed to be easily offended
B	no
A	you can't not not not be offended or whatever it was you said last night
B	yeah you don't have a right not to be offended you don't have a right not to be offended
A	yes I get it now when you said it last night I think I was too tired
B	oh
A	but I knew what you meant but I couldn't get the sentence
B	yeah
A	but by the way erm
B	mm
A	erm but that but I do think that everyone can believe what they want like people can be really strict to the letter of the Bible if they want
B	yes
A	erm in their lives
B	yes
A	erm
B	yeah
A	er because I because I
B	yes
A	it makes me think are there people who might believe in God if they thought that it could be a bit erm
B	yes
A	cos I I don't think like her
B	no well that's this is the whole topic
A	and there are all sorts of different types of Christian churches and erm whether or not they're really strict or erm
B	this is actually the problem with religion
A	yes
B	nor should it be like that
A	maybe it should be a private thing cos I actually don't really like it when people ask me about my religion cos I'm like well what's it got to do with you? you know it's my own private thing and it usually gets people worked up if you talk about religion
B	well they shouldn't ask you then
A	no
B	can't ask someone and then get annoyed with their opinion
A	but do you know what I think is really bad is that erm usually most of the time if you're English and you you admit that you believe in God people look at you weird and I think that's really poor
A	I think that's really poor
A	they'll like go they'll like go really?
B	what's a pariah?
A	don't know
A	I think it means that you're somebody who's like out of society someone who's like a leper
A	shall we look that up later?
B	leopard
A	and I think that's really rude and I think people should bloody
A	you bloody weirdo what's wrong with you?
B	you're gonna burn in hell
A	so it means that like my friend
B	mm
A	but this is the other thing my dad said to me you can't talk about things where people don't agree with you you get so enraged you know when I was at home going I can't talk about skinny people
B	mm
A	I just can't even talk about it even if you're agreeing with me because it's so upsetting
B	no you can't go through life like that you can't
A	but the but this topic is a bit of a hot one I'm not sure I should bring it up
A	what erm
A	it's the fact that I went to private school
B	oh
A	are really shitty about it and
B	that's just dumb though
A	I actually think that the next person who's shitty with me about it I'm gonna punch them in the face
A	or the verbal equivalent if I could get the verbal equivalent of the
B	yeah
A	I don't punch people in the face
A	erm but I'm gonna bite their head off basically because I'm sick of it and I was really disgusted cos my really good friend at work who's gay
B	yes
A	and I'm totally fine with that
A	so if I'm fine with that can't he be fine with me going to private school? when he worked
A	when he realised it no no no I don't think he had
B	yeah
A	they'll say all this stuff about it and then you go
B	oh
A	and and that that's what happened with my gay friend at work he went on a
B	oh did he?
A	rant about erm how outrageous it is for anybody to go to a private school and I let him go on and on and on about what bastards we all are and then I went yep I went to private school I won a scholarship actually
B	yeah
A	because it's actually like an excuse
B	yeah
A	like it's not my fault I was just so clever that I got in on a scholarship
A	do you know what I mean? and it and I realised that I actually mention it for that reason I'm not now I'm not gonna mention it not gonna give them that satisfaction
B	yeah
A	I'm gonna go yeah I went cos I'm really privileged
A	and you all lost out and I it was so unfair cos I got a much better chance in life than you and er and yet here we all are in the same job so I don't know why you're so upset erm
A	erm but no
B	mm
A	and I and I just kept yelling that I won the scholarship
A	and
A	so I was like well if it's not better how is it unfair? so it's like there's no need to go because it's not even better so it's like so therefore it's fair erm
B	yeah
A	and then and then I said to her erm
B	mm
A	and I'm not even gonna go into any other reasons but I'm just telling you
B	yes
A	why it's better so you had thirty people in your class and I had six so
A	you get individual attention
B	yes
A	and I'm I'm some privileged arsehole who should feel bad erm and I was just like well I'm I'm afraid I said to her if I could afford to send my kids to private school I would
B	mm
A	but one of them's probably gonna have to win the scholarship because it's very very expensive
B	mm mm
A	and you have to earn a lot to
B	mm
A	erm to go there
B	mm
A	and
B	mm
A	it's almost worse than being a Christian if you've been to private school
B	telling you
A	and his face
B	was he embarrassed?
A	yeah really embarrassed
B	oh
A	I find that I've rarely had that pleasure
A	I can't I can't remember isn't it annoying?
B	cos it's it's when they
A	I can't remember
B	change people's minds or not
A	yeah
B	erm
A	but I would think that they would know that I went to private school cos he's one of the people cos he's like a supervisor he would have seen my CV and do you think if you saw on a CV
A	I dunno maybe it doesn't but to me it always sounded like a private school
B	I think no I mean there's probably loads of schools
A	yeah
B	erm
A	to me it like sticks out like a sore thumb you know
A	head of house I I don't have that on my CV any more
A	but when I was younger you know when you haven't got anything on your CV except your education?
B	yeah
A	so
A	I thought that would be quite obvious
B	a giveaway maybe to someone who is au fait with things like that
A	mm
B	but someone like me will just go and
B	and get it
A	also not only private schools have houses but I do think it's a bit of an antiquated thing
B	there was this woman so one of our discussions when I was doing my
A	makes you think
B	yeah and it was really really really good so there was this and this particular erm semester all these this lectures that I was going to were all about real life scenarios so there was one MP English MP and
A	sorry what was your course called?
B	er it was legal and political theory
A	mm
B	it was very good because
A	did you enjoy it?
B	I love it I loved it I loved it I loved it
A	was it a fulfilling year?
B	yes
A	oh
B	I didn't want to leave I was gutted that it was only one year I loved it I loved it I loved it but not just the not just the studying
A	everything
B	everything it was just brilliant the place was fantastic the uni was fantastic
A	ah
B	the little cafeteria was fantastic the student uni
A	was it difficult? like was it was there in any way the possibility of like?
B	not passing?
A	yeah
B	do you know this is it's the story of my life
B	but I can't really apply myself so there you go I'd rather go to the pub this is the whole thing erm
A	but it wasn't like oh my god I'm so out of my depth I don't understand what's going on?
B	er
A	yes
B	and I was looking through some of my essays cos I really like reading some of my essays and I mostly got Bs and I'd never really really put myself out
A	excellent no that's brilliant
B	I mostly got Bs and
A	this is an interesting thing in itself by the way because I always killed myself with things like that like literally had a nervous breakdown erm over it
B	mm mm
A	and got top marks but which it what you know it could say
B	I think that is a gift in itself though I think that's
A	is it better to just enjoy it and get a B?
B	no cos it's always the same
A	erm
B	do you know what the problem is? I've never been able to go when I was occasionally I did like really really work on something and at uni as well like really enjoyed something and went out of my way
A	yeah
B	but most of the time it was like I could have done better than that I could have done why didn't you just try? if I'd actually tried and it's you get sick of yourself saying that to yourself like oh yeah I could have done better
A	but maybe
B	mm
A	and enjoy the fact that you didn't have to kill yourself because I think with me it was actually that I cannot live with that I can't live with knowing that I
B	mm
A	haven't done my best that's a real
B	yeah
A	what's the word I mean? it's a a burden
B	yes
A	what what was what was the word? a erm
B	yeah
A	it's a
B	weight
A	it's a yeah it's a
B	it's a
A	it has a real
B	like a burden or a scar or a
A	yeah
B	it'll come to us
A	yeah
B	relax
A	and it was the same when I was applying for my own job all the time you know I nearly killed myself three times trying to apply for my own job and it was like but but because I had said to myself I'm gonna die if I don't get this job
B	oh
A	cos I want it so bad so therefore
B	yeah
A	I have to like do my best and I know that if I do my absolute best they're totally gonna pick me
B	yeah
A	so I have to do my best and if I don't and then my friend erm
B	yeah
A	and erm she sort of like spent about half the time I did erm maybe even less
B	yeah
A	erm
B	yeah
A	and my friend came third
B	right
A	so if I hadn't killed myself
B	mm
A	my friend would have come second
B	mm
A	possibly
B	mm
A	so it was worth it but was it?
B	mm
A	you know cos
B	yeah
A	I did and my and she I I did think I actually think that's right because I knew how much time she had spent and
B	mm
A	I knew how much time I had spent but in reality we're both as good as each other
B	yeah
A	but I just went the extra mile eight hundred times and she just sort of went oh do you know what? I wrote my admission essay last night and I but the thing is I looked at her and I envied her
B	oh
A	because I thought
A	honing it and honing it and then so two hundred and fifty people applied right? and my boss said that I mine was the best essay now that's wonderful right but I said to her I should bloody think so
A	because seriously I nearly killed myself and I think that's a curse wouldn't you rather be you or my friend who's like right I'm gonna I've gotta do this but I'm not gonna make myself ill over it do you know what I mean?
B	I dunno I dunno what's there ain't there ain't really a right or wrong with it again is there? it's just cos I I've spent my life saying I could if I really tried I could do this
B	if I actually really tried I could do this but just don't get round to really trying any of it
A	and I've I've spent my life going I've done that but nearly killed me though
A	and my mum actually said to me recently she was like you've done too much you
B	ah
A	you need to stop it cos it's all been too much and I and I think she's right do you know what I mean?
B	naked in the woods book reading Feb twenty-second at seven PM
A	what day is it today?
A	no I really wanna do it
A	shall we come back? oh no we'll be on like some
B	naked in the woods book reading
A	that's so my kind of thing
A	although do you think if you got there it would be like weirdos?
A	oh
A	I really wanna do that
B	apparently not
A	do you remember how cold
B	greasy spoon café
A	actual spoon
B	what woods? in the in the red forest?
A	the redwood oh it's difficult for me to say anything cos I was like coffee house greasy spoon safari ah
B	see these little towns are wicked these little places I could stop at every single one
A	I wish I could remember where
A	I need to remember whether
B	oh can I just tell you though?
A	it was your uni
B	no yeah but about the dissertation so I got by with mostly Bs and the odd C
A	that's great
B	it was good until it got to the dissertation where you're supposed to you have it's like ten thousand words it's
A	it's the hardest the hardest part the dissertation
B	you have to start planning it months before
A	was it a masters?
B	yes
A	this is the problem isn't it?
B	and I
A	don't you sometimes think I'd rather just have a diploma because
B	no this this was the best example I thought cos I really loved the subject and what I was doing I really loved it
A	oh what was your subject?
[ANNOTATION]	Two speakers are discussing how to achieve a diploma.	Entailment
B	it was about animal rights and how
A	oh of course
B	it's gonna evolve
A	fantastic
B	erm and no is animal
A	wow
B	and it was so fascinating erm and I decided to do a bit of a combination of terrorism and animal rights and the rest of it
B	and ended up chasing him about for about three weeks before
A	which one?
B	the
A	oh the uni one
B	the uni one yeah he was lovely
B	so the last few weeks revolved around hanging not hanging about with him I only went out with him on like a few dates
[ANNOTATION]	The two speakers discuss dating a bit.	Entailment
A	but was it fun?
B	it was loads of fun it was so much fun he was lovely he's he's really smart he's on Youtube erm someone told me cos he's erm doing really really well with his stuff
A	ah
B	erm
B	so but and the reason I got that partly is cos you know they do plagiarism now? like they can scan your work to see if it's plagiarised mine was forty percent plagiarised which again was the maximum
A	oh no
B	yeah it was the maximum but I was doing it the night before the night before I was an absolute wreck
A	ah
B	have you heard of that? so she had to do that
A	good that you passed though
[ANNOTATION]	The concept of plagiarism is now considered subjective by some universities.	Neutral
B	by the skin of my teeth I passed that
A	I also only just passed my masters because of one thing that I got fifty percent on that was like interpreting
B	really?
A	and erm cos I couldn't do the interpreting er let's just recap that I was the best one at the translating
B	yes
[ANNOTATION]	The two speakers agree that fifty percent is acceptable.	Neutral
B	mm
A	it's so difficult and then the exam
B	mm
A	she called me up and she went just to let you know what's happened erm
B	mm
A	now I didn't realise this because I couldn't do it anyway
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Both speakers are really enjoying discussing the exam.	Neutral
A	but the exam was completely wrong
B	oh
A	they had used a text that was written and you can't do that you have to have a spoken text
B	right
A	so they had or something like that they'd read out a completely outrageous text that would be difficult for anybody to interpret
B	yeah
A	because it wasn't a
B	right
A	so they'd completely fucked up which by the way I find absolutely inexcusable
B	yeah
A	to not even be able to get off your arse and find the proper text for an exam
B	it's pretty bad
A	which affects the rest of our lives
B	yeah
A	so anyway she called me up and she went erm there's been an enquiry into the exam
B	right
A	and it's been found that it was completely
B	okay
A	test material
B	yeah
A	erm and therefore everybody's been bumped up five percent
B	oh
A	and therefore you've got fifty percent
B	so you passed it?
A	yeah but only because the
B	the because of that?
A	but the thing is I I sort of like couldn't stop laughing that day because I was like I hadn't passed it but I did because of the thing but actually you could say I would have just scraped it if the text had been correct
B	right
A	do you see what I mean? so like I was
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	I was proper borderline and they used a shit text
B	and that helped
A	so I went down five percent
B	yeah
A	so either way I guess I would have been dead on fifty
B	yeah
A	and when she after I put the phone down I was just like oh my god thank god
A	because I would have failed my masters because of interpreting and and the reason I did both was to find out which one I wanted to do you know?
B	to do
A	and erm luckily I had the other half that could do erm but so it's amazing when you get that fifty
B	well I thought to myself as diabolical as it is it is a pass
A	yeah
B	if they if they could have failed me they would have failed me or
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	if they should have done they would have done so it is a pass but it's more the fact that I was embarrassed cos I that really was poor I was up the night
B	I was up till five o'clock or six o'clock in the morning copying somebody else's work
A	did
B	yeah
A	oh good
B	oh yeah he was
A	well I vaguely remember about him
B	yes
A	but can I ask you? so I wanna go back to your course
B	yes
A	but also can I ask you? so your friend what's her face from Ghana she
B	yeah
A	you met her the first uni?
B	no no no no so I finished the masters degree and then had to go back to work and went to
A	ah okay okay cos I cos I got confused earlier thinking you've known about the theory of everything since you were eighteen
B	oh no
A	no
B	no no no no no
A	erm but
B	yeah
A	is a Christian
B	yeah
A	like proper majorly
B	hell hell fire type Christian
A	now that I like that because now I can say to you when you meet people and they announce that they're Christian do you think flipping heck?
A	so you know you've got me and her I don't know if you've got anyone else
B	well no
A	it doesn't sound like you're that judgemental cos otherwise you wouldn't be friends with her right?
B	erm I think that would be see that's
A	cos some people just think you're a nutter by default then?
B	I used to be a bit like that I used to be a little bit like that and it's not that I would ever try and change someone else's views
A	mm
B	but I might used to think to myself
B	you've got science you've got
B	and now
A	so really the the key to everything is
B	the theory of everything
A	the acceptance of other people's erm like you do what you want there's the buffet
B	well I've got a really good it I need a pen and paper but I'll I'll show you later what how it makes sense and it might it might sort of help but I wanted what I wanted to tell you first
A	I know
B	there's loads of subjects
A	I think that we shouldn't be trying to persuade each other to to come round to the other way of thinking but you can have
B	you can have a discussion with people
A	discussions
B	yeah
A	but I don't think it's right for either you or Miss thingy to be trying to force the other one
B	no
A	to think differently
B	no
A	but it's an interesting discussion do you think that could be a key thing? cos I think that's a key thing because erm people should just bloody leave you alone if you don't believe in God or leave her alone if she does erm like nobody should be saying you're wrong you shouldn't be thinking that because everybody's different
B	well
A	or when you get older you decide your own that stuff don't you?
B	well as parents you you do decide cos you that's your job
A	yeah
B	when it until they're old enough so you have to do that but but what I said to
A	yeah
B	it's
A	people need to just learn to
B	mm
A	another
B	no but this is the good thing about that is that you can't
A	mm
B	so you you've gotta not care what other people think if you if you've gotta have strong enough erm
A	mm
B	you've gotta not worry about what other people think and if they're that
A	no cos I don't judge people who don't believe in God and so I don't see why they should jump to conclusions about me because I do but again who cares what they think?
B	yeah you can't
A	arseholes
A	oh sorry no judgement
B	no but you couldn't have erm
A	have to start again aren't I?
A	from scratch
B	no cos it's constantly erm
A	but would you rule them out?
B	I just think I don't see how you can think like I wouldn't be able to relate to it I wouldn't like
A	mm
B	you know you've got geology and that tells you how old everything is and how and it's it's sort of it's evidence
A	yeah but this goes back to the whole thing of erm how some people listen to the Bible down to the letter and others don't like you know I don't think it necessarily means that the world was created in that day
B	but that was always
A	she's a traditionalist yeah
B	it's in the it it's was written thousands of years ago it's true
A	she's the proper old school Christian type who you know er taking it all literally
B	well I think that's that is frightening because that's that shows how
A	can you
B	yeah she can be right for all I care if you see what I mean like she's totally entitled to
A	like could be could be that her version is true
B	yeah yeah
A	I do think that you see this is why I quite like my situation because I I don't sort of like feel like the science and the religion conflict with each other cos I'm not such a traditional er by the book
B	yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	Christian type so it doesn't actually have a conflict
B	yeah exactly
A	I don't sit there worrying about that
B	yeah
A	and what I thought was really maybe this is going too far if you're not a a religious person but erm
B	mm
A	erm do you remember what it is? it's where
B	a face imprinted on it yeah
A	yeah so it's you in theory it's the thing that Jesus was wrapped up in
B	mm
A	and when my mum and dad came to visit me and we were doing touristy things we went to see the Turin shroud
B	mm
A	and I forget this is
B	mm
A	it's erm kept because otherwise it would be like disintegrated if it was constantly out
B	yeah
A	I'll have to check with dad I think it was out when we were there so that's why we went because it was like for one month the real shroud
B	was there
A	can be seen and it's only in this one church this really small church
B	yeah
A	not in the centre of town
B	yeah
A	and erm so we went and we're not fanatical so we had our doubts you know we were like what do you reckon? do you think it's true? and all this stuff and erm so we
B	yeah
A	is it really true?
B	yeah
A	and the priest I won't be able to my dad can tell this story better I won't be able to say what he said as well as he did
B	yeah
A	but the priest said
B	oh
A	and it was so he was so holy that guy he just made us feel wonderful
B	yeah
A	and and I agreed with him like but that's what it's about for us
B	yes
A	and for people who don't believe in God they're interested in the carbon dating
B	yes
A	erm whereas to us it doesn't really matter whether the carbon dates back to then or not kind of thing
B	yes
A	erm and I thought that was really wonderful how he kind of
B	oh
A	and we and we went off going yay
A	erm but I actually can't remember all the stuff about the carbon dating it's really interesting about the shroud but I actually can't remember the facts to tell you
B	well the thing is
A	also
B	I love the discussion on religion
A	yeah also I do think science erm
B	well
B	and these erm
A	flipping heck
B	that's science innit?
A	yeah
B	and she said yes but these methods that you're talking about so say I said geology and therefore you can tell how old this rocks are and and when life began on earth and all that kind of caper she said yeah but these are man made machines and
A	well she's very old school
B	yeah but this is the point of it is it doesn't matter because she's perfectly entitled she's
A	yeah
B	totally totally totally entitled to it and the world would not be complete without it the world would not be like
A	I wouldn't go with the devil theory I was gonna say erm what annoys me about science is I watch a lot of erm
B	Bank of America
A	oh where?
B	left
A	left here?
B	yeah what I'd do turn round here right
A	go right yeah
B	well you could do
A	yeah oh well done
A	where is it? I can't even see it
B	it's right next to that car
A	oh fantastic yeah no what I was gonna say is I watch loads of erm you know I love all these detective dramas and stuff
B	mm
A	and it drives me insane because one of them I watch is called The Good Wife it's basically lawyers
B	mm
A	and erm so each team of lawyers the defence and the prosecution always have scientific evidence and it always has completely opposite er findings
B	oh
A	so one that one of them will get a scientist who'll say that this happened
B	mm
A	because based on this er
B	mm
A	testing and then the opposite will will find a scientist who believes the opposite
B	mm mm mm hm
A	and then that that does throw me for a loop cos
B	yes
A	I'm not even thinking about religion when I'm watching these at all
B	yeah just goes to show how
A	I'm not thinking oh this proves about God or anything
B	no
A	I'm just thinking how oh everything is completely erm
B	yes
B	mm mm
A	but I mean aside from that
B	mm
A	it's really upsetting that so cos I also find science to be very like you know ah we know this and we know that but then
B	yes
A	when I watch those programmes which admittedly are just stupid box sets
B	yes
A	but it's
B	well the idea has come from real
A	it's really realistic
A	but you know so then so then what? you know it's like
B	well
A	wouldn't you like to know more about science and stuff and and be involved? not really erm
B	I'm not very scientific I never really got it
A	maybe animals you know like finding out about how whales this that and the other you know whales the animals not the country
A	marine biologist
B	sort of thing
A	yeah yeah
B	but then I say that I could have done well it's another one of those things where I could I could have done that if I'd tried harder
A	where do I go?
B	could have done
A	I still can't see it
B	it's a bit worrying
A	here where the dog thing is?
B	er
A	but I just can't see it anywhere
B	it's right there man
B	it's probably best to walk from here
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	this is sort of breaking up a a conversation but it's too good to miss seeing a Bank of America
A	well done you're so erm
