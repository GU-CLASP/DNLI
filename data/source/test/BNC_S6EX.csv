C	I don't understand any of Facebook any more
A	well I was saying to
D	well that's the point isn't it
C	no but it used to tell me everybody's birthday so I never so I stopped writing it in the diaries
C	and now I don't know anybody's birthdays until the day
D	mm
C	and if I don't go on it every day I don't know
A	you could put it on your phone like
C	yeah but my phone's rubbish
A	no you're rubbish
C	my phone only only logs ten different appointments in there
A	does it? Oh alright
C	so you can't go above ten things
D	well you've only got ten friends
A	has she got that many?
C	oi
B	A few more are coming to the party aren't they
D	yeah they're all my friends
C	yeah I'm a bit surprised about that really
B	what?
A	how many have you got so far?
C	I need to do some emails
D	I don't know it's kind of
C	well
D	sixty or something
A	yeah
C	I've got to email some people
D	yeah it's going to be
A	my brother won't be coming
C	did he?
D	oh okay
C	oh is that why what he phone up about?
A	yeah
C	is he alright?
D	okay we can turn him red then
A	well it's a bit embarrassing for him because of
C	yeah
A	and
C	but I just wanted to send them an
A	yeah yeah
C	I I knew that they probably wouldn't come
A	I knew
B	well I thought he'd come come without him if anything
D	with his OCD
A	yes he's got
D	mm
B	he doesn't usually
A	no but
C	Cos I used to play computer games with
D	hmm
C	didn't I
A	mhm
C	A little computer
B	who did?
C	he was playing
C	huh?
B	that's that's I just remember that bit
D	what he had the glove his gloves on the?
B	wrong wrong hands
C	I remember
B	and he insisted on wearing leather gloves for indoors
A	yeah
C	oh
C	oh
D	how old was he then?
B	about eight I think
D	oh wow
C	yeah I think I remember him when he was about eight yeah
D	so he's had it years then
A	yeah
B	when he was little he was fine when we
D	if he was wearing  if he was wearing  leather gloves indoors that's a bit strange isn't it
B	yeah that's right
A	yeah yeah
B	that must have been where it all started
C	maybe but maybe not
D	hmm maybe
B	yeah
C	yeah
D	mm
C	no
D	mm
A	it's terrible isn't it
D	yeah
C	everybody's got some sort of obsession on a
D	mm
C	so
B	mm
C	some people just have it
D	I remember when I was about
A	that is yeah yeah
D	and if you keep doing it then it just
B	yeah
D	I remember every
A	yeah
D	I had to turn around
A	oh right yeah
B	oh
D	and for no reason
B	yeah
A	you have feelings like that don't you
D	yeah
B	well it's quite common to to look in all the wardrobes before you go to bed isn't it
C	mm
D	yeah
A	I used to look under the bed
D	yeah
C	I had a friend who I had to go and look under her
B	oh gosh
C	in in America and I had to go in and look under her bed before she went to sleep
B	really?
A	one obsession I used to have
C	yeah because that's because it was her habit but because she still lived at home
A	yeah
C	well no she always had somebody there to look under the bed
B	wow
D	hmm
A	one obsession I used to have when I was a kid was to count the stars on this wallpaper every day
D	yeah
C	but once you start doing that then you'd then you don't stop
B	I had starry ceiling paper I did
D	you had starry ceiling paper
B	it was  it was  done like the proper stars
D	oh right
C	ah like oh really
B	mm
A	really?
C	I like that
B	it was nice
C	like the real night sky on your ceiling
B	yeah
A	yeah that would be good wouldn't it
D	mm
A	but then when people doodle or have nothing to do you find yourself lining things up
C	no you don't
A	yes you do
C	honestly?
A	line them up like that you see
C	that's what you like to do
A	yes everything
C	ah
A	except when I look at
C	huh?
D	it's
C	she has got chickenpox
D	she's got chicken pox
A	yeah
C	just three little spots and you can tell what they've got
B	mm
C	and then she's come out all spotty
B	you reckon?
D	maybe that's where it starts
C	urgh scratching
D	if you don't wear the mittens then you're gonna get spread disease
C	oh what cos you're told don't touch that
D	yeah
C	Don't touch don't touch don't touch when you've got chickenpox
D	mm yeah
C	well otherwise everybody would be a bit obsessed with scratching and not scratching and I don't know that many people who are like that
D	mm
C	I was gonna
D	it's so weird though isn't it what how people's brains work
C	but I think  I think  with erm training you can get
D	oh yeah
C	but like like when you have a deep engrossed habit like that it's practice can get you out of it
D	but some
C	yeah
D	Cos everyone goes through it at some stage
C	it's like
D	yeah
C	that we want some sort of schedule or some sort of
D	yeah
C	get up
D	I wonder if they've identified the gene for that cos that's quite an important one because people could use as well
C	they could manipulate that gene to make us all robots
D	yeah
C	robotic
D	that's that's a good story that is
C	and then  and then  you just train them to do repetitive actions or to do
D	yeah but there's no uniformity in it is there
C	mm
D	or checking the door's locked ten times
C	it's just pure habit though
D	mm yeah
C	like people can't sleep or can't rest until they know that they've locked the door a hundred times or tested the door handle seven times
D	mm
C	turned around three times and
D	mm
D	oh yeah
C	I'd go back and check it maybe twice one day
D	mm
D	yeah but you don't trust yourself enough in your head to go yeah I did that
C	mhm
D	and you have to go and check it
C	no
D	I don't know
C	but the reason I check it again is because I don't remember checking it in the first place
D	mm
C	so if I don't remember checking it how am I going suppose to remember to count the three times
D	yeah but that
C	but then I walk away and I did I do it? Didn't I do? Did I do it? Didn't I do it? I'll go back and do it
D	yeah that's why they have the ritual of like you do everything like three times
C	mm
D	so you know you're going to do it three times
C	okay
D	but then  but then  it gets to the point where you do it three times but you didn't do it right because your hand wasn't in the right position or something so you have to go and do it another three times and then  and then  someone made a noise while you were doing it so that one doesn't count
C	mm
D	it just becomes insanity
C	yeah but it can happen to anybody
D	oh yeah
C	I don't think there's a genetic
D	it can
C	no
D	oh I do as well
C	they've got a new name for erm the mixture of genetics and environment
D	A mixture of nature and nurture?
C	yeah they've
D	do you? I don't
C	no
D	I think there's definitely a gene which some people are more
C	prone to it
D	prone to it
C	mhm
D	so everyone's but it's like anything isn't it
C	everybody
D	everything's on a sliding scale
C	so surely you can make that worse or make it better depending on your environment
D	mm
C	no
D	you don't think it's genetic at all
C	yeah everybody's got it genetically
D	oh no it needs a trigger
C	and and how
D	A social trigger
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	and how you've practised and rituals that you've developed and rituals you've copied and the routines that you're
D	yeah when er
C	so I think if if I put myself in a weird situation where I start checking the door three times or I start counting erm things in this room every time I come in this room then I can develop a weird problem
D	mm
C	through habit
D	go in there a minute then
D	well she wasn't well when we were down there
C	no God
D	well kids do though don't they
C	at least she keeps herself busy
D	yeah
C	that's another weird ritual people have like if they get sick you get those people that if they get a little bit sick then their treatment is lie down and recover and don't do a thing until they're better
D	mm
C	or you get the people that work through it and work work work
D	that's not a ritual that's
C	that is
D	that's just what you've been taught
C	well that's exactly
D	that's not a ritual
C	but then when you're older that becomes part of you of how you get better
D	mm
C	and that's all that you know
D	mm
C	so I think it's all a similar thing of how you've developed your behaviour
D	like cultural reality isn't it
C	it's just you develop your behaviours and it's difficult to change when you're older
D	mm
C	and it just and
D	yeah but it's only possible to develop that behaviour because it you've got some genetic makeup for it
C	yeah but everybody's got it
D	yeah
C	so it's not a predisposition to be
D	no so you
C	it is but there's not a predisposition
D	mm
C	you where where they can look at the genes and say I'm afraid you're gonna unfortunately have this problem
D	yeah
C	that kind of psychological problem
D	well it's the same with alcoholism isn't it
C	yeah
D	they they say that that's genetic
C	no no no
D	but I don't
C	I don't think it is
D	I don't think it is either
C	yeah
D	mm
C	because you can see how everybody has got a little bit of something
D	yeah
C	everybody's weirdos
D	mm
C	it's just how
D	mm
C	mm
D	but if you go through a traumatic experience these walls get broken down and make you more vulnerable for things like this to get in
C	yeah
D	and then because a lot of the time they they become manifested in after a big event or a
C	I yeah mm
D	do you not think? Boredom
C	through not knowing what to do with your time
D	mm
C	you know
D	mm
C	well yeah yeah depression then okay
D	mm which is
C	lying in bed counting the things on your ceiling or something
D	Cos you've got nothing else to do
C	yeah yeah
D	yeah
C	and then it just becomes a habit and it becomes a life
D	and that  and that  basically is everything isn't it
C	yeah
D	each need to keep active
C	yeah I think so
D	and it will keep a hell of a lot of problems at bay just by doing that
C	when you sit I mean I
D	mm
C	or sit and even play a stupid computer game or do something that takes your mind off things but in doing that you're taking your mind off your problems but then you're doing something stupid like counting or
D	mm
C	that's where Facebook is actually quite a good thing because if that becomes like a somebody's habit for you know they're actually still communicating with people
D	can you count that as communication?
C	mm
D	yeah well
C	yeah
D	it's impersonal
C	but some people
D	yeah
C	and then
D	I don't know it's completely different isn't it
C	but that as a distraction for your life
D	mm
C	isn't so bad compared to I don't know sitting in a room staring into space
D	but it is a distraction for life which is bad
C	yeah
D	mm
C	and I think she can hear everything that we say but then we end up staring at the screen going oh I can't hear them
D	mm
C	yeah
D	I'm gonna talk really silly now
C	shouting
D	mm
C	they're going tomorrow
D	I thought they were going on Thursday?
C	no
D	where are we going then? Friday?
C	we're going out Friday
D	oh
C	yeah
D	yeah
C	that's why they've been packing and making bread all day
D	oh I wondered
C	she's making cakes
D	I was like uh? If I was going away I would do it ten minutes before
C	that's why shopping yesterday was so important because they said I've got we've got no time to do it on Tuesday
D	mm
C	yeah they'll just check it
D	mm
C	I think that's what they're going to do
D	mhm
C	she didn't
C	yeah
D	well they're not at the scratchy stage yet are they
C	but did you see when we were there
D	well that must be a genetic thing because you do that
C	it's a nervous thing
D	nervous?
C	I don't know
D	yeah I'm going to start I'm going to give you mittens
C	I'll try
D	yeah the chickenpox only get scratchy once they become erm what do you call it?
C	pussy
D	well once they start scabbing over a bit yeah
C	oh I see
D	and then that becomes itchy
C	right and then if you pick them off you get scars like this one here
D	yeah when they first
C	my chicken chickenpox scar
D	chickenpox scar
C	there
D	mm
C	there
D	yeah
C	huh? You only got one as well?
D	er yeah think so
C	I've only got one
D	well maybe down there
C	you don't really get them on the rest of your body do you
D	just on your face
C	why? mm
D	but when are they erm what do you call them?
C	contagious
D	contagious
C	er no I think now
D	that would make sense because you're scratching it and spreading it and getting it in your nails and
C	come on everybody
D	well no you send your kid to nursery with chickenpox you'll probably get it taken off you by social services
C	I don't know what will happen
D	from neglect
C	yeah but from neglect
D	yeah
C	I don't know what will happen but she
D	mm
C	see like Mum and Dad when they were childminders they used to let all the kids come here if they had chickenpox and the parents used to still go to work which is fine
D	yeah it should be
C	it's like you just phone around the other parents
D	mm
D	mm
C	I mean surely all the they know that they have to have it
D	mm
C	I thought
D	you can't have a jab for chickenpox
C	can't you?
D	no
C	you could have
D	measles
C	yeah she had MMR
D	what when she was?
C	little baby
D	no
C	think she did
D	I mean put pumping all of that shit into a little baby's blood is sick
C	yeah
D	well yeah well
C	well it must be awful
D	but you've now developed
C	yeah
D	you were a strong baby that fought it off
C	I've got a strong
D	you've got
C	oh I don't know
D	well I know
C	is she alright?
B	yeah she's fine
C	what's
B	no they've got to stay off for a week
A	oh I said she can take her to nursery
C	yeah
D	mm
A	Cos they say they might get infected
B	er cos that's their policy
D	that's
B	that's just their policy
A	it's their policy
D	the don't get infected do they?
B	makes life easier for them
A	and that's one less and just
C	and they still have to pay
A	yeah that's true
C	but
D	well I suppose  I suppose  it's looking after an ill child which wouldn't be much fun
A	yeah we we used to though
D	mm
B	we always told the parents
A	and we told the parents and
D	mm
B	or oh that doesn't matter cos they already had it
A	and they said great
D	mm
A	Cos we used to when we were kids we used to go to chickenpox
D	mm
C	mhm
B	well I I know these I know these nurseries won't
A	well some
C	yeah
D	mm
A	not even a cold
C	but
A	she probably did yeah
B	probably cos you're you're usually infectious before the pox come out
C	ah okay
B	you're not usually infectious you can't usually spread it afterwards can you
A	no you can't spread it
D	oh really
B	strangely enough
D	oh
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A believes the chickenpox is very easily spread.	Contradiction
A	no
B	well that's what I read somewhere
A	I told her  told her  that
D	urgh
C	urgh
D	urgh
B	horrible
C	urgh
B	yeah
C	is she going to have a little party round her house then? For
A	yeah that would be good wouldn't it
[ANNOTATION]	Parties to spread the chickenpox among children became popular two years ago.	Neutral
C	come on kids
B	mm
C	yeah
A	they'll all be coming anyway I expect
[ANNOTATION]	They do not know anybody who has had chickenpox before.	Contradiction
B	is she having a party?
A	I don't know if
C	well no
A	yeah
C	yeah
D	mm
A	but I mean any any sensible sort of parent will let them have let them get it you know
[ANNOTATION]	It is a good idea for your children to get the chickenpox.	Entailment
C	mm
A	and you know like don't worry about it
B	they're not ill with it
A	they're not ill they just get it and
B	the only that gets a bit irritating
C	mittens
B	but if you put the stuff on all the time
[ANNOTATION]	Having the chickenpox as a child is irritating.	Entailment
A	you put camomile lotion on just
C	I remember having that camomile lotion all over me
A	that just cover you in pink
C	yeah yeah I remember sitting in the bath and getting covered with that pink
A	yeah
B	sitting in the bath?
C	getting
A	well you probably
C	to put it on to wash it off I don't know
A	you probably er had it all over you and then sat in the bath and saw that you had it all over you
C	I don't know
B	you only splash it on the spots
A	you just put it on the spots
D	mm
C	pink
A	mm
D	mm
C	oh yeah that's not nice
B	I think
A	he did didn't he yeah
C	and that was it?
A	and
B	and she couldn't well he he came none of the others were so erm she presumed that that's what  that's what  he had
A	yeah
B	and that's all he had
D	three spots
C	now is that dangerous for an adult if you haven't had chickenpox?
B	and then some are absolutely covered completely
A	yeah
C	is it dangerous for an adult
A	it's very dangerous for an adult
C	but oh yes yes you said
A	we told you about
C	yes yes
B	and
B	she couldn't cope at all
A	her littlun
B	I think it might have been
A	we had to help
B	definitely
C	mm
D	hmm
C	ah little
A	yeah but kids get colds anyway
C	mm
D	mm
A	you do
D	you're just going to get everything aren't you
A	yeah
D	mm
A	people don't let them anymore
B	mm
D	hmm
A	you know every puddle
A	yeah
C	well you've got
D	apart from when there's a drain hole
A	oh yeah
B	well it depends if they've got best clothes on
C	oh
B	does matter doesn't it
C	what did you say?
D	apart from when there's a drain hole
A	yeah
C	oh
A	I remember  I remember  this
C	there are stories aren't there
D	I think it was nine nine nine with Michael Beurk
A	is it? Yeah I remember the programme yeah
D	this kid was by a river or about a hundred metres from a river in a field and he was jumping in the puddles and he went straight down this hole
B	oh no
D	it was like a hundred metres
A	yeah
D	came out in the river
B	oh
A	wow
B	God
C	yeah
A	that is scary
B	imagine if he was any fatter or
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	you know half way down
D	oh dear
C	like on what is his name? Angus Gloop from the chocolate factory
D	yeah
A	oh yes like him yeah
A	that was so funny
D	mm
C	yeah
B	mm
A	measles
B	measles can be dangerous yeah
A	it can even
B	mm
D	mm
A	there's The Plague yeah
A	everybody has to eat a rat before they die
D	yeah
A	yeah that's drinking dirty water isn't it
D	polio
A	yes there's plenty of things that can kill you ain't there
D	oh it's fun isn't it
B	it's fun
A	the strange thing is
D	mm
A	and if they get them they just lay down and die don't they
D	mm
A	and that's it
D	mm
A	and they just take it as it come
D	yeah
A	like them
D	yeah it's funny isn't it
A	yeah
D	but with humans the fear is of of death
A	the yeah that's right yeah
D	it could come in a variety of different ways
A	yeah yeah
D	in
A	yeah
D	it's weird
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well that's that's the big thing to be scared of because the older you get the nearer death you are aren't you
D	mm
A	that's the point
D	yeah but you never know when it's going to come do you
A	no no
D	so there's no point
A	oh dear
D	no
A	no?
D	what joke?
A	that was terrible
C	what's terrible?
A	the joke that er I can't remember it all so and it was only about The Devil
A	something like that anyway
D	so he decided to stay in between that?
A	yeah he had decided to stay in between that because that was so wonderful that he
C	oh
D	mm
A	and that was just the ten minute tea break
D	yeah well heaven and hell's a stupid idea anyway isn't it
A	it is isn't it
D	yeah
A	if yeah if if God really loved you as they say he wouldn't punish you would he because God sort of is supposed to love you
B	brother?
A	that was his brother
D	yeah
C	well it was a fallen angel
A	yeah fallen angel
D	yeah
A	well you you
D	you can't have a constant paradise
A	yeah
D	you need a a wide variety of evil and good to
B	to know what's good and
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	yeah
C	do you though? Do you?
D	hmm?
C	you need some bad things to happen to know what's good?
D	I think so
A	well
D	otherwise you've got nothing to judge it against
A	that's yeah
D	or
A	yeah it's like pain isn't it
D	mm
C	but you forget it fairly quickly
A	you forget pain very quickly
B	luckily yeah
A	I forgot it
C	and you get
D	mm
C	and you get used to it and it
B	yes you can
A	yeah yeah
D	but when you're extremely happy I mean that's because of the serotonin in the releasing the the dopamine or whatever
A	yeah dopamine or
D	so it's a chemical reaction but is it not also a memory of being like in a depressed place as well
A	depressed state yeah
D	and so oh wow we're not thinking this consciously but being aware that there's that big difference
A	yeah
B	that's why you appreciate
D	yeah exactly
C	but winter is beautiful in so many ways and evil is not beautiful
A	yes but it can be so miserable
D	yeah but if you lived in the North Pole like the Inuits where they've just got darkness for
A	six months of the year
D	I mean they they've got the highest suicide rates
A	yeah
D	yeah
A	no there's That's right the change isn't there
D	really?
B	mm
A	yeah
D	oh
A	anyway we better get on
C	mum's got her book out
B	yes we're all  we're all  going to do it?
C	yes we'll all do it
D	do what?
C	we'll sing happy birthday song
A	happy birthday
D	oh okay
A	right
B	I did have the phone as well
C	erm
D	when does she get her results?
C	I've forgotten
D	twenty ninth I think it is
C	twenty-seventh
D	okay
C	I don't know
D	oh shall I turn that thing off?
B	okay
D	or it's going to get us singing happy birthday
