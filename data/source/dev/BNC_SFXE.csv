C	oh that's the one place
B	it is I prefer I know they say like some of the coasts are really kind of they're just it's just Britain in the sun sun now
C	yeah
B	but central Spain is really I went to erm
A	I I'm yeah I'm fascinated by Spain and the culture and
C	have you been to Granada?
A	I absolutely love it
B	no I want I want to go there
A	it's like for me it's a magical wonderland
C	Alhambra
B	mm
A	have you been there?
C	no ah yes I have yes now I when I first went there er it was in the middle of the winter and it was cold cos it was halfway up
A	it's freezing yeah
C	halfway up the Sierra Nevada
A	snow on the mountains yeah
C	yeah er and there was snow on the top of the mountains the whole thing
B	mm
C	and I got really cold
B	mm
C	and we came back down and we were doing a private tour and we came down and had a stopped at a caf√© at the bottom I thought oh I could use some hot soup so so I was young in those days I ordered some soup yeah
A	was it gazpacho?
C	yeah gazpacho
A	oh no
B	mm cold
C	freezing bloody cold
A	that would be the biggest let down ever wouldn't it?
B	yeah
C	it was it was it was a wonderful flavour
B	nice and summery soup
C	it didn't warm me up one iota yeah
B	oh no
C	but I my when I was er er reading Arabic my prose text that I had for the exam was
A	mm
B	mm
C	as in Jabal Jabal Tariq the
A	Gibraltar
C	Gibraltar
A	yeah
B	mm
C	and
A	yeah which is a little town when
C	it means in in Arabic it means the island
B	er
A	er
C	it's an island yeah so it was all about that Roderick
A	mm
C	but then that was the er Moors writing about their own invasion of Spain it was great fun
B	yeah yeah
A	I really like to see all the Arab influences in Spain
C	yes
A	it's
B	yeah
C	they're in the music they're in the art
A	mm
B	mm yes
A	and in all and
C	yeah
A	and erm
B	yeah
A	erm which must come from
A	yeah sun and
B	yeah
A	it's it's really incredible and you there I read a book erm about this it was this writer that travelled round Spain I mean it's it's very well written so erm more than very like heavily facty but he was looking for signs of er kind of Moorishness in Spain like
B	mm
C	cos the the Umayyad Caliphate phase lasted a lot longer in the west than it did in the east because it was taken over er in the east Damascus fell and er was taken over by the guys from Iraq
A	I find it funny in Spain when they say oh the the Moors were here and then we reconquered it it's like that was eight hundred years it's not just they were here for a cup of tea and then left
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	it was a you know a real substantial part of the well compared to the history that you're talking about maybe eight hundred years isn't er isn't that much but
C	yeah yeah
B	yeah
C	well it's yes it could be like that
A	yeah
B	it is fascinating though
C	but it is an amazing place but that's that's I've never been there I'd love to go
B	mm
A	I would highly recommend it yeah
C	like Laurie Lee
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah
A	I love
B	I want to go to the north of Spain though had that is that got erm like Celtic
A	yeah lots
C	I tell you northern Spain
B	influences yeah
C	er you have the Basque country
B	yeah
C	do you know Basque is the
B	oh yeah
C	it's it's Indo European languages came in several millennia ago partly with agriculture
B	mm
A	mm
C	and Welsh which is language I spoke first at home er I often thought was maybe not Indo European but it is it's it's just an early Indo European language but Basque isn't it's probably a pre
B	mm
A	just where did it come from it's it's?
B	well it's
A	yeah it's it's incredible
B	mm
A	and they're yeah
B	mm
A	they're so proud of it and it's
B	yeah they're trying to protect it aren't they and?
C	yeah absolutely and they should be
A	and it's such a lovely sound I really like and the write the way it's written I really cos it's just so different to anything that I
B	different yeah the first time I saw it I was so shocked that that was part of in
A	yeah
C	but you do you get these these little patches of language which absolutely fascinate me
B	mm mm
C	in Turkey you take well it's you know it's
A	mm the
C	Kara it's the
B	our our old well my grandad's cat is called Kara
C	well kara means
A	the black cat black
C	means it's actually dark
A	oh is it?
C	yeah
A	oh
B	oh
A	oh
C	er
A	ah
C	so it's a dark sea but but you can use it for black as well
A	yeah
C	as opposed to the white sea
A	oh is it?
B	ah
C	yeah well in that area around the Black Sea Samsun in the middle of the Black Sea
A	mm yeah
C	just south of there there's a group of people who still speak a language which is known in Turkey as the Pontus Rum now Pontus is the original name for the Black Sea classical name for it and Rum is the Arabic name for Rome but not meaning Rome it means the Byzantines it means Black Sea Byzantine Greek
A	mm
B	mm
C	and my my old mate
A	mm
C	she was Turkish Muslim the works but she could understand Greek television but she couldn't understand Turkish television as as well she she was Pontus Rum
A	wow
C	and this thing it goes back you know hundreds and hundreds of years and it's still there there's a tiny pocket of people
B	wow
C	Pontus Rum
A	oh Pontus Rum
C	another group erm I was with last year right at the far end of the Black Sea at Trabzon erm which is the old colony of Greek colony of Myelitis going back you know Hellenistic period anyway they erm they have a group of people there which are known in Turkish as Laz Laz the Laz are probably from Georgia originally but they're not totally Turkish and they don't recognise where they've come from
B	mm
A	no connection the Lar that you were talking about
C	no
A	no
C	L A Z it is
A	oh okay
B	oh okay
C	and they have conspicuously large noses
A	mm
C	right and and we always say well of course
A	mm
C	and the Laz are know themselves and are known to be particularly slow-witted
C	and they'll say oh I can't understand that I'm Laz
C	and and we were I was our driver when we were going round I was coming right down the Armenian border erm last last July and our driver was Laz and he had certain idiosyncrasies of language which I'd never come across before and he was trying to learn Kurdish
B	mm
A	mm
C	which is a totally different language erm so we were all trying to learn Kurdish at the same time
C	not much of it spread to me and but erm there there are these little pockets of language all over the place like that
B	yeah yeah its amazing isn't it?
A	even even the dialects we have in in English like I kind of think oh I'd understand someone from Leeds someone from here but there are words
B	mm
A	like we call it down here an alley and they you in
B	a twitchell
A	a twitchell and in I can't remember my cousin calls it something else
B	yeah
A	she lives in Leeds and
B	so not so much kind of different language but different
A	languages but different
B	words and still there and
C	yes
A	and it's incredible to think I was like a what? and it's
B	mm
C	well even in Welsh there are dialects of Welsh
B	mm oh really?
C	I
C	and south Wales it we were in south Wales recently it's like another country to me it's like a foreign country

B	mm
C	er has now it's sanctifying name the Vale of Meditation
A	oh

B	just yeah but apparently they I didn't watch it all but apparently the Japan's they the Japans? Japanese actually played really well
C	they did
B	so they deserved the win
C	oh they were very courageous and they were the last closing second they could have drawn by a kick
B	oh really? oh I didn't see that
C	kicking a penalty and they chose to run it and they scored a try and eased the two they would have either drawn the match and they actually won by two points
B	wow yeah

B	yeah I can imagine
C	hugely expensive
A	I've had my head in my master's so much I've just finished yesterday I handed in my thesis yesterday
C	oh really?
A	for my master's and I've had my head so much in that that I didn't even realise it was going on in in Britain
C	no you wouldn't do cos it it's a very lonely place isn't it? doing a thesis
A	yeah and I and then the when
B	you did really well though you she kept coming to work
B	yeah
C	my son is I sincerely hope as we speak finishing his master's MSC dissertation which has got to be in my midnight on Monday
A	I can feel his pain
B	oh
C	oh yeah well
A	yeah I just said I'm just so excited to re-join the world that's why I've come to celebrate today
C	yeah it's a it's a it's a very when I was doing my PhD it's a terribly lonely place cos nobody wants to know what you're doing and that's all you can talk about
B	but that's all you know yeah yeah
A	mm and
C	but you know
A	I just feel it's when people say how are you? I'm like oh I'm really tired but I'm still writing and I I hear myself sounding really boring
A	and I don't want I have got some interesting things to say just not at the moment
C	no no no it's it's it's it's a terribly lonely place
B	yeah
A	yeah I don't know what to do
B	you don't know what to do with
A	I don't have to work seven days a week like that's not true
B	yeah relax
A	to
C	I remember when I finished my first degree and it my last exam was in Arabic and I had these the the I had Quranic Arabic to do and I had this book on Roderick Last of the Goths and I I mean the I had to memorise so many different languages and so many different dialects and I managed it except that when I finished the exam I remember going to the common room picking up a Times and starting to memorise the the the stories on the front page and I thought there's something wrong here
A	yeah
B	just trained your brain in to
C	I got yeah I used to
A	did that work?
C	yes
B	that's such a good I like listening when I was practicing Spanish I listened to like podcasts and things and just kept
B	yeah
C	but you know and I could I only had to pick up the first word or two in a in a unseen translation and you know I would know what it was cos I had it all in my head
B	wow
A	that's
C	no it worked
A	like sleeping with the dictionary under your pillow and it might just all go in
C	no no that's not
B	yeah it'll just float into your mind
C	it's a bit different
A	osmosis
B	yeah
A	no but I didn't I I I've heard that as a myth but I didn't know it was actually
C	well it seemed to work for me
A	yeah that's incredible
C	whether it was psychological or not I don't know
A	I might erm I might start having podcasts on in Spanish when I'm sleeping
B	yeah they say yeah they say like if you want to give up smoking or something listen to like or if you want to learn I think they do say
A	mm
B	listening to them
C	but it was was very it's a bit tricky really doing this degree it was a I had endless seminars all week you know with different members of the faculty in different languages and if I didn't turn up there wasn't a seminar
C	you know and I had I was the only person who could answer all the questions cos I was the only other person there
A	than was incredible they ran the course just for one person I don't think they'd do that nowadays
B	no they wouldn't do that
A	no no they stopped the they closed the department when I finished that's why I couldn't do a go on to do a
A	carry on
C	postgraduate work in in in ancient languages so hence I went to the careers advisory service and hence I got became an archaeologist
B	ah
C	and when I came into archaeology it I found it was so from a disciplinary point of view so flatulent you would say oh well I think this is such and such a thing you know you made it up as you went along I thought I'd come from such a hard discipline where unless you absolutely knew what it was you couldn't say
A	mm yeah
C	you know you had to know it
A	yeah
C	er and it took me six months
B	to
C	until I woke up one morning and though do you know what? I'm an archaeologist and I never looked back after that
B	ah
C	started teaching shortly after that and zoom that's a long time ago ladies
C	a long time ago
A	well it's just like really great that you've been able to do something like that you love and is a passion and
C	oh absolutely
A	rather than having waking up and going oh
B	yeah I've got work again today
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I I really love what we do
B	mm
A	I really enjoy it
B	yeah I do
A	it's it's quite a bit a bit of a treat I think to have studied languages and then to be able to work with them cos there aren't that many jobs
B	mm yeah
A	with languages
C	yeah so are you permanent staff of er
A	mm
B	yeah yeah it's fun
C	excellent
B	yeah
C	so how how how long will you go on doing this particular piece of research?
A	well the we hope that two thousand and fourteen will be the middle point so we started collection in two thousand and twelve and it will hopefully finish kind of February twenty-sixteen so but to to to reach that target we need we need about fifty hours in a
C	oh I see
A	so hope that's when we're hoping to finish to data collection obviously the like the quicker you can collect it the tighter it is
[ANNOTATION]	they are academics	Neutral
C	now
A	yes
C	language and pedagogy research
B	yes
C	right?
A	mm
C	erm I fell out with the University of
A	why was that?
B	oh no
C	I had I had a letter from some daft woman who said that I had to go and attend a weekend seminar
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c studies languages	Entailment
C	on the assessment of dyslexic students
A	mm
C	and other pedagogic issues and I thought what? and I wrote back and said if you if you really understand the word pedagogy you know then I'll come but since I'm absolutely certain that you don't then I won't
C	and I never looked back from there
A	mm
C	so what what do you think it means exactly
[ANNOTATION]	speaker c received a letter	Entailment
B	oh no being tested now
A	yeah wish
B	well we only have one person in the team that's really working on it and she looks into erm kind of teacher materials how they're used in their classroom at the teaching and learning side of
C	what is pedagogue?
A	I'm just scared to get it wrong
[ANNOTATION]	pedagogy doesn't study learning	Contradiction
unknown	laugh
B	yeah don't want to say any more
A	in in the context so we where we work it's it's the study of like
C	but you use pedagogue almost in a derogatory sense you can do meaning someone who teaches rather pompously
A	no that's definitely not erm the sense that it's all about
C	but you still don't still don't know what it means pedagogue is a person who teaches children
A	is it? oh I guess I guess ped yeah yeah
B	so just
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a already knew the meaning of pedagogy	Contradiction
C	that's what it means
A	yeah yeah it makes yeah
B	yeah that makes sense
C	it's a it's a schoolteacher if you like
A	mm
C	since I knew this woman did not know that I thought well
B	yeah so pedagogy
C	yeah but it's changed its meaning obviously because of Latin
B	yeah mm
A	yeah well it makes sense
C	it's your actual Latin you see which you know wouldn't you? from your Italian
A	yes
B	that does make sense now
A	yeah
B	yeah
C	curiously enough I did the equivalent GCSE is O level in those days I failed O level Latin
B	oh no
C	I I can't believe when it's such an elementary language and I taught it to my I was teaching my son Latin and I thought how
A	just wasn't your language or?
C	no cos I was going out collecting rocks all the time
A	oh the rocks I remember the rocks
B	yeah
A	I've never well I've done Italian but I've never done Latin so erm but they're obviously very close in parts
B	mm
C	yeah
A	interestingly I was living in
B	but they don't they like you saying that though
A	yeah they don't like you saying that and you can argue where it anyway that's another like whole issue but knowing I think knowing French and Italian helps you more with understanding Valencian than knowing Spanish
B	yeah
C	really?
A	because yeah and
B	yeah and erm
A	it the way it's put together the structures it's not very Spanish
B	no I think like Catalan as well
A	yeah
B	just knowing French more than Spanish would help
A	yeah helps
B	would help you more
A	French and and Italian
C	when you were studying
B	yeah yeah
C	I there any well there must be literature in as we describe as literature?
B	in written?
C	written
B	in
C	in Mandarin
B	er yeah the character's different in that they're it would be in traditional characters rather than simplified
C	oh
B	cos I learnt the simplified version which they
A	which is still very complicated
B	yeah so they could help with it was mainly so they could help with the the eyesight cos Chinese people were erm they all wore glasses because they were concentrating so much on all the different parts of each character so they simplified them so they could
A	really?
B	yeah
A	that's fascinating
B	yeah because they've got the highest and they had a really high rate of erm illiteracy and it
A	because they were so hard
B	because they were so hard so they just simplified it for their eyesight and so they could so people could learn it
A	that's really interesting I didn't know that
B	mm
A	so have you have have you ever learnt any Chinese or you said?
B	and there's
C	nearest I'd say I've got is Turkish which is a an Altaic language it's from the Altai Mountains in Mongolia
A	yeah
C	it erm Turkish and all the Turkic languages come under that designate as an Altaic language you can speak modern Turkish from you know Izmir in the west all the way to the Oxus river and beyond Bukhara Samarkand and you would be understood apparently
B	mm wow mm
C	yeah
B	there are loads of different dialects
A	in China
B	in China as well so many
C	I'm sure
B	well I was in
C	well yeah you know long may it last
B	mm yeah
C	the greater the diversity of language the better
B	yeah yeah
A	my erm my uncle's from the Cameroon and he his language is completely like the next village along they can't understand a word
B	oh really?
A	and then the next village along a completely different language again and they've got they've got French and English its erm those two are always taught
C	that implies they've been there a long time
A	yeah
C	for that separation
A	it's and he yeah it's incredible
C	it's er I mean looking at bush bushman languages the Sam languages in southern Africa erm there were originally scores of them
A	mm
C	and they were all different and the you know they would they'd been there for hundreds of thousands of years
B	mm yeah
C	yeah so but it language is an absolutely fascinating thing
B	mm
C	you know we try and work out when did language start erm
A	oh that's amazing I went to three
B	oh yeah
C	well his name's
A	ah
C	and
B	mm
A	mm yeah
C	which is interesting when you look at something like Homer because the Homeric epics were obviously sung the opening of the Iliad is something like sing rage oh muse
B	mm
C	er talk talking about the
A	mm
C	yeah it's incredible
B	mm yeah
C	and then they would remember hours' worth of the stuff and would sing it in modulated speech
A	it's amazing
C	well I had I had just the last cruise now I had a couple of the boat who were a lovely couple er
B	mm
C	where they use the singular rather than were were you?
B	yeah
C	er and she would do that regularly and didn't know she was doing it you know that was her normal way of speaking
B	yeah
C	it was rather rather quaint I thought
A	that's the kind of thing we're hoping well not that we'd be particular interested in but someone would be interested in for the in this project is we we collect all the metadata of of where people are and where they live and and then you could look up and you could
B	yeah to see if it
C	well I haven't heard it for for years but there was
B	was you yeah
C	what my mother would say say using language she'd say meaning bad language in that case
B	mm
C	yeah
B	I I always notice my friend from Northern Ireland she would say when we were like cross it in China it's really hard to cross a road so you kind of have to just take it
A	go
B	just go and er you're waiting for all these cars to go passed and then you're like right and then she's like ah we should have went then and I'm like no
C	we should've went yes
B	we should have gone then we don't say went
B	that's that's not right and I always noticed I don't know if it's from north
C	well that's how language develops
B	yeah
C	I I I spent a
A	I'm just going to pop to the toilet one sec
C	I spent a couple of years living with a guy who was doing er an MA in language
B	yeah
C	and and I'd say oh but
B	yeah
C	so I can use it then
B	yeah
C	that's how he would say it
B	yeah otherwise we'd all by we'd still be speaking Latin if it didn't change
C	true
B	if that was the earliest
C	but I mean English is a most extraordinary language cos it's so has I mean it's a bastard language
B	mm
C	it has Romance and Teutonic and
B	yeah
C	all sorts of things all mixed together er and I it's it's so expressive but it's been so ground down in certain parts I was talking to erm a lady from New York
B	mm
C	last week and listening to her speak and in in New York they don't like to have an open vowel at the beginning of a word
B	oh okay
C	so they'll take the consonant from the previous word and stick it on to the
B	put it oh
C	so as in Lon Gisland
B	Lon Gisland oh okay I've never noticed yeah
C	yeah
B	yeah that's fascinating
C	you you runcle
B	your yeah
C	runcle so you you're taking the you you emphasise it with the last consonant of the word before in front of the word which doesn't have it which which has a vowel
B	well that's interesting because erm we found out erm not long ago actually that the word uncle used to be nuncle
C	yes it did
B	so and that's kind of a similar thing we've just changed it over
C	well it's the same with erm erm orange it was actually narange
B	narange
C	er
B	yeah it's
C	yeah
B	I want to say nuncle now
B	change it back
C	you do get it with some older texts as a nickname nuncle
B	oh really? wow
C	er for for an uncle I've seen that but it's it's er the way in which language develops and evolves
B	mm
C	er and
B	yeah
C	you know we try in paleoanthropology to work out when language starts
B	yeah that yeah
C	erm but it I mean it's it's impossible to know
B	mm
C	there was a there was a very famous paper written in the nineteen sixties by two erm American paleoanthropologists it said you can tell can't you? why Homo sapiens er developed over Neanderthals erm because and this was a scientific paper they said it's because it's because Neanderthals could not
B	what?
C	you think what? no it was it was in all seriousness
C	and that's why they and he was er no and they became extinct bizarre totally bizarre
B	yeah I just find it strange when people are erm say when they like my friend saying oh I should have went then
C	should have went yeah
B	like that's totally wrong I mean it's not wrong if that's how
A	if that's how she says it then
B	if that's how they using it in that kind of region then it's not wrong it's just changed changing form what the rule that we that we were talked
C	yes
A	my my my dad used to get really angry because I grew up near here and we like with the the glottal stop so like water
C	oh yes yes
A	and he'd be like pronounce it water and it it wasn't he used to think I did it deliberately to annoy him
A	and and it wasn't it was just how I spoke it was how all my friends spoke
B	yeah
A	and it it was natural and he's get so angry and yeah and it's just how I I used to say to him you we should have lived somewhere else
B	in New Zealand they say like wader no I'm not very good at the accent but
C	if you if you lived anywhere anywhere near the Thames Estuary you you lose all all your consonants you know the
A	hello
