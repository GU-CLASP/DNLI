A	so when are you
B	in November
C	is it booked?
B	no but that's the plan and we have got places
A	mm
B	erm organised
A	who's who's we?
B	oh well it's
A	are you gonna fly straight there?
B	well that was the hope I mean this was
C	can't you
A	why?
B	no this was
C	can't you just
B	Mumbai via Mumbai
C	can't you fly to well Delhi and then get a
A	mm
B	mm
C	internal flight?
B	yes well that's what
A	no go overland it's so nice it's so
B	yeah? what
A	mm
B	train?
A	no er on erm
B	bus?
A	yeah buses it's very exciting
B	mm I could do that
A	but if you fly in and you fly out it's such a culture shock when you arrive and
B	well yes that's true
A	well er you're not going trekking are you?
B	we are going to be walking but we're going to be doing
A	are you gonna climb Mount Everest?
B	on a no absolutely not I've looked at it
A	have you got Sherpas?
B	and it's extremely challenging
A	mm
B	which is good but looking on erm looking on the website initially at this holiday it looked as if it was rather expensive but now that we can only find a flight for only find a flight for nine hundred
C	I'm sure you can flights to Delhi and Mumbai for four or five hundred pounds can't you?
A	mm
B	well if we looked just at those
A	mm
B	it would probably be cheaper than looking at Kathmandu
A	mm
B	I mean you have you been? because you've been to India
C	no I've just been to Delhi and Rajasthan
B	yeah?
C	mm
B	and when did you go
A	mm oh I went as a youngster
B	oh was this when you were doing your greyhound and before you got to Greece or after?
A	mm
B	cos I haven't done any of it you see and I'm very conscious of that that I may not
A	but I think
B	very soon
A	things have changed since then cos I went overland and you could go through places like
B	mm
C	mm cos you went to Afghanistan
A	Turkey went through
C	mm
A	I spent a lot of time in Afghanistan yeah
C	mm
A	and then Pakistan and there was fighting then
C	mm
A	civil war but it wasn't like perhaps as dangerous as
C	how did you travel there?
A	erm I went on a
C	mm blimey
A	but came back on public transport
C	blimey
A	with chickens and camels and
C	who did you go with or were you on your own?
A	mm
A	the reason I went was because I'd been in a relationship for a very long time with a boy when I was young
B	mm
A	so I went to London and bought a ticket a one way ticket to Kathmandu
B	brilliant
A	I didn't know anyone
C	what did your mother think of that?
A	well you know parents in those days didn't seem to worry
B	no
A	and you'd er I gave poste restante addresses in a few places I thought I might be going to
C	sent me a postcard letter
A	yep so I'd send a letter once a fortnight and I'd pick up the odd letter from them once I fortnight
B	what about international phone calls? when I was in Austria you could do
A	well in Europe you could but you you couldn't
C	you had you had to
A	in those countries
C	book them really didn't you?
A	oh I dunno I never even tried
C	yeah
A	we were
B	for how long did you spend doing it then? it must have taken up a very long time
A	going there I think took about er do you know I can't remember? I've got it somewhere in a diary that I'm close to finding
C	mm
A	turning out all my junk erm probably about three months going there
B	mm
C	so how did you finance it?
A	I worked
C	mm mm
A	I think the whole trip was only
C	and I thought I did quite well coming back from Greece on my own
A	did you?
C	mm
A	how did you come back on your own?
C	well erm cos I was there for a year and I decided to go round the islands so I did that and I suppose that gave me some confidence so I thought well I'll be able to travel overland back to England so I got on a bus and went to Corfu and then got the ferry round to Dubrovnik
A	mm
C	and I met these four Australians in a camper van on the boat and
A	but in those
C	I think it was nineteen
A	that was when
C	nineteen seventyish
A	mm so Tito was still there in Yugoslavia
C	probably
[ANNOTATION]	Person C is going to dance with Person B	Contradiction
B	mm
C	and these Australians I think they probably weren't getting on very well two doctors and two nurses and they
A	why did you meet them?
C	on the boat going to Dubrovnik and they said would you like to?
A	why did you go to Dubrovnik and not Italy?
C	well cos I wanted to go through Yugoslavia
[ANNOTATION]	Person C wants to go to Yugoslavia	Neutral
A	oh right okay
C	I was actually heading up to Hamburg where my cousin lived so I joined them and we travelled up through Yugoslavia erm
B	in their bus?
C	in their camper van they had a tent as well
A	so when did you say goodbye to these people?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is asking that when he see them for the last time	Entailment
C	I said goodbye to them at er erm Strasbourg
C	in my flat he was really small he was a doctor an Aussie guy
B	sounds very weird
A	why did he sit on your lap? Weren't there enough chairs?
C	he was just a funny sort of he just used cos he was I was quite tall and he was
C	and I I
C	since my two have been in Australia
C	I'd quite like to look him up again cos I stayed fairly friendly with him and then I think he must have gone back to Australia or something
A	oh
B	did he just do it to tease you and come and sit on your lap or did he have
C	no well when we were sitting
B	conversations?
C	when we were sitting in the living room with the flatmates and friends and there weren't enough chairs he used to sit
A	did he fancy you then
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that he might be like them	Neutral
C	no no he was too short for that I don't think he fancied me
A	mm
C	he was like five foot one or two quite small for a guy
B	obviously bright which was a compensation
A	mm
C	so they were both gynaecologists both erm both the blokes
[ANNOTATION]	Person C said they  were both obstetricians	Neutral
A	so this was that was before you met
C	in
A	did you? in seventy-six cos that was in the
B	that was quite brave
A	by yourself?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think he is brave to go there alone	Entailment
C	well it was no it was on a you know bus with lots of Australians and people so we went
A	mm as they do on their way home
C	and we we went through Holland and Scandinavia Finland St Petersburg
B	mm
C	and I
B	so where did you actually go when you went to Poland that time?
C	we went stopped in Warsaw
B	mm I hear that's a really good place to go
C	but
B	if you're starting
C	and Russia was quite scary
B	yeah
C	really because
B	you were quite both quite intrepid weren't you? I don't think I did anything like that
C	and I I went on another overland trip down to Morocco
A	have some peanuts
B	thanks
C	thank you that was just in a minivan I mean just
A	with?
C	it was just one of these little overland companies so erm
A	but it was quite adventurous in those days to go off and
B	mm
C	well it felt adventurous
C	to go and live in Greece
A	yeah
C	particularly from my background my parents had never been abroad
A	mm
B	did you learn some of the
C	I learnt how to swear at people in Greece
B	anything else?
C	at languages
A	but it was a very different
B	mm
A	Greece in those days cos you couldn't get things like things like
C	we had we
A	there was no instant coffee you just had to
C	though we had Nescafé
A	did you? well what year
C	mm
A	was that then?
C	that was erm sixty-nine
A	where did you find Nescafé?
C	I didn't buy it but the family seemed to have it it's who you know isn't it?
A	I used to take it back in my suitcase with sausages
A	and you never had butter
C	I don't remember butter very much
A	I used to miss butter when I used to go there
C	but the woman I the woman I worked for was PA to Latsis that big
A	mm
C	ship owner and I think through connections with him she possibly got certain things
A	yeah cos you couldn't get it
C	mm
A	I mean there weren't even supermarkets in those days
C	no
A	they were all corner shops it was very
C	but erm I did have an American boyfriend there

A	how long did that last?
C	not my friendship with him?
A	mm
C	mm six months?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C had a Mexican boyfriend.	Contradiction
A	mm
C	and then through my sister I was complaining that I didn't ever meet any Greek men and she was at university in Kent and her good friend was a Greek guy and
A	mm
C	probably as tall as
A	in contrast to the gynaecologist
C	mm
B	you used to
A	oh right and did he take you out?
C	yeah we went out with his friends for meals and
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker's C sister didn't know any Greek person.	Contradiction
B	good job you did then because actually

B	mm I think you were very intrepid both of you my most intrepid thing was going over when I was nineteen on the train going back again to meet the boy that I'd fallen in love with on the erm sixth form trip
C	that was quite intrepid for those times
B	mm I don't know
A	sausages from
C	five kilos of

A	really?
C	yeah they're so much nicer than British sausages
B	you were saying you'd taken sausages to Greece what I was
A	oh
B	it made me remember
[ANNOTATION]	Polish sausages are more expensive than British.	Neutral
C	they'd brought them back

B	quite often
A	well I go
A	and yeah and tomorrow there's a secret code if you go into Starbucks anywhere between eleven and twelve and say the word cocoa

A	so I'm going tomorrow
B	er
A	between eleven and twelve
B	where is one?
A	if anyone's free and wants to come with me
B	yeah where is one?
A	well
B	where is the
A	er
B	oh right
C	I think she knows where all the coffee places are
A	I don't really like I prefer Costa er to Starbucks
C	they're gonna sell coffee down the village shop aren't they?
A	what? Costa?
B	I think they already do
A	if they get a Costa machine I shall be there every day
B	they already do they already do sell coffee
A	what kind of coffee?
B	mm I'm not sure
C	you know about the village shop do you?
C	do you know the woman in the post office there?
A	they employed someone new didn't they?
C	cos she's taking on the lease of the shop and
A	oh really?
C	and she's just very upset
B	I mean that must be awful cos she's
A	that must be quite quite serious
B	she's been really involved
C	I mean people don't like
B	very loyal
C	organised efficient loyal conscientious but these middle class women
B	she isn't she doesn't
C	she isn't
B	present a good persona when you go in
C	but will it make any difference? I mean people either go in a shop or they don't
B	I would've thought if she'd been employed surely she'll have some rights
C	yeah she's gonna go for she told
B	mm
A	so who actually employed her? was it the village? the Co-operative?
C	I think the the yes the Co-op
A	well it's the group of people who've got shares in the village shop isn't it?
C	mm
A	so who made that decision?
C	there was a meeting
B	there was a big meeting mm
C	in August which
B	which er yeah
C	we weren't around
B	we were both away
A	oh really?
B	didn't realise the significance of the importance of it
A	because the whole wasn't the whole the the big sort of issue before was the fact that they were gonna lose the post office part?
C	well that seemed to er
A	and then
C	work out that
A	and then a new lady
C	mm
A	came in
C	yes
A	and this is this lady that's where does she come from? is she local?
C	yes
B	she is cos er
B	she is local
C	somewhere up that way
B	she's local
A	so she's taking on the whole?
B	I think she is the right kind of person
A	mm
C	the question is
B	er she's very approachable
C	the question is
A	so
B	mm
A	business concern is it?
C	mm it was a lease or something
B	I was gonna say how on earth will that work?
C	I don't know
A	yeah
C	yeah
B	er someone lives in the flat which is part of the er
A	but that's rent is it?
C	mm
B	mm
A	rented so the rent helps to pay
C	yeah
B	mm it's not cost effective it was never going to work as a business and so this may
C	you've still got to get
A	so what's she doing?
C	people to go in the shop though
A	she's renting it
B	yeah
A	she's renting it off the
B	mm
C	she's bought the lease or something like that hasn't she?
B	mm
A	oh
B	mm
A	so does that
C	the problem is the
B	there'll be deliveries Sunday
A	what did the
C	they owned it didn't they?
B	er I don't know I remember
A	oh before
C	mm and also there was that miserable guy erm
B	mm
C	he was he was a bit
A	yeah but that was before the whole
C	mm
B	mm
A	took it over
B	mm before it became a community shop
A	yeah
B	mm
B	mm
C	my sister in law helps there
A	but why is it successful?
B	it still has definitely
C	they do they do sandwiches and foodie things there
B	do they?
C	mm
B	I think it's all about footfall isn't it? if you don't get the footfall how can you possibly?
C	yeah it's the footfall
B	mm
C	doesn't matter who's serving
B	mm yeah
C	yeah
B	to get the market right people er go to drop in they're going to want a post office they do want a
C	yeah but they don't do Lottery tickets any longer
B	okay
C	they weren't high enough turnover er tut
B	okay
C	they took it away from them
B	okay
A	really?
C	you see the there's
A	it it's the fact that it's not on the main road and it hasn't got parking
C	it's cos it's not on the main road
A	or it hasn't got parking
C	no parking you go there and you can't park
A	mm see I I never think of going there and I should really I should support it
B	well that's because your local one is
A	yeah but it's not
B	no no no but I mean your local shop
C	but these middle class
A	well my local shop is what?
B	is the Spar
A	yeah
B	er why would you be going to
A	to to
C	well I usually go there and buy eggs
A	you know it's a community
B	mm
C	we get our paper from there
B	well I go there
C	and but
B	for those kind of things
C	I've found
A	but I mean they do things like Hobbs bread don't they there?
C	yes I don't like Hobbs bread very much
A	don't you? I find it's
C	and it's quite expensive and
A	I thought it was supposed to be so good
C	we don't eat much bread I suppose
B	they've tried to offer
A	and
C	yeah
B	oh yeah yeah that's really nice that's a very local village shop thing
A	but I mean there's no money in that I think I
B	mm
A	I think what was what were they a pound or something?
B	no no no fifty P
A	fifty P
B	mm well there is a little bit of trickle of money I guess but it's always gonna be difficult for things keep thing like vegetables isn't it because they go
C	well they just go off
B	they go off mm so I think it's a very difficult task
C	it is
A	are there a lot of people in erm
C	I think there's a few old people in the erm
B	mm
C	old people's places
B	it's a
C	it is useful if you're
B	supposed to be essential
C	cooking something like I was and I've not got the right ingredients
A	mm
B	it was very good for a for a
C	but it's just too expensive they can't sell things as cheap as Lidl or Tesco so
B	er no but if you were going to go there
A	mm
C	yeah but it's still cheaper than getting spend on petrol in your car and
A	I'd have thought there would there would have been quite a few elderly
B	but people do go to the farm shop you know in
C	mm
A	but that's terribly expensive
B	I know but I'm surprised who I've seen in there I've only been in a few times but it's been quite a cross
B	a section of the
A	she doesn't does she? it's I mean it's shockingly expensive in there
B	but there's there's young mums with with erm babies who I've seen in there
A	really?
B	mm
C	how how can they have got the money?
A	I don't know how they can afford to
C	how can they how have they got the money?
B	husband with a good job I suppose
C	yes yeah
B	you can have a cup of this you can have a cup of
A	I had a disgusting coffee there about six weeks ago
B	did you?
A	yeah
B	and you pay a lot for your vegetables there but you can get some quite nice
A	it's not only that you see a quiche or something and you think
B	it's artisan
A	oh I'll really
B	mm
A	treat
C	mm
B	and you can yeah so
A	you know myself
B	you can buy quite a lot of nice artisan food that's readymade that
A	yeah but it's so expensive
B	I know that's why I don't go there but that is why people go there you can it's terribly convenient and you can pop in you can definitely park
A	mm yeah that's true
B	and you can pick up all the things you need and yes it will cost you quite a lot more
A	well if you're feeding only one person you can buy something that'll last you
B	mm
A	you know three nights
B	I think that's how
A	mm
B	to do it really
A	that's how I'd
B	sorry
A	but if you were trying to feed
B	mm
A	other people as well
C	oh yes the one who cooked the cakes and
A	yeah
C	she was such a hard worker
A	oh and she she
C	she was baking cakes on the
A	yeah
C	premises
A	oh and things like quiches and
C	yeah
A	it and it was so reasonably priced and you could order it as well
C	mm
A	in advance if you you know
B	I don't know why she stopped why did she stop?
A	I think it all got too much for her
C	yeah
A	and then this other woman took over and she was useless
C	she had
A	lovely cheeses
C	she had cheese yeah
A	and and
C	used to get some
A	lots of local sort of you know
C	mm
A	that Stinking Bishop
B	but what what happens then of course is that people are finding markets like Tesco's Finest or erm Waitrose or whatever they're selling their wares to supermarkets
C	they don't sell that sort of cheese though do they Tesco? it's quite boring
A	Waitrose does in
B	no I disagree I disagree you can get very nice cheeses
C	but there's stuff that she had in jars like the pickles and things
A	mm
C	were quite good
B	maybe
A	I don't know and she had children didn't she?
B	mm
A	and she used to employ people to work there
C	she did and she was busy
A	but they were very nice ladies
C	yeah
A	and they had everything like for example really nice cards that
C	mm
A	local artists had painted
B	mm
C	mm
A	and they'd printed the
C	but they were there as the
A	I I used to spend a fortune when I went in there
C	mm they also had the trellis work and stuff outside didn't they?
A	mm and you could get potatoes and
B	mm what happened to that wonderful place off the
A	did we go?
B	yeah didn't we go that one time off the
A	whereabouts
B	it was erm
B	oh right that's not the right road then and we were off the
A	right oh
B	and erm
A	what after
B	and erm they were it was a very eclectic place called selling erm vintage this and vintage that and also you could have cups of tea and things
A	food or
B	er yeah
A	junk?
B	no no no
A	you're not talking about the junk shop?
B	yeah it was a junk shop but it was also it was erm
A	not the one
B	no no not
A	not yeah
B	they've got a wedding coming up so I think they're buying things for the garden cos the wedding's going to be in the garden
A	I don't know what place you're talking about
C	the wedding's not going to
B	mm
C	oh you mean
B	mm
C	mm
B	so yes she is buying things statues and things for the garden
A	I can't think what place you're
B	mm
A	thinking about
C	you know
B	cos it's all out of date
C	it's out of date how did we manage to bring our children up?
A	who told them that?
C	health visitors and people
A	mm
C	so
A	who's faces?
C	not don't listen to anyone over forty and there's him saying this to them
C	erm
A	but that's almost as bad as you know
B	mm
C	so she was telling me this with
A	or just talk about when you did it
C	when I
A	you did it
C	did it
B	mm
C	it really helped or
B	I found it usually helped me to talk to other mums
A	but people do interfere
C	yeah
A	do people do interfere horribly don't they?
C	I didn't
A	and they're always you know
C	I didn't have anyone to interfere with me
A	mm
C	did your mother interfere?
A	no but when I was in Greece with babies I mean god
C	mm
A	it the you know
C	mm
A	being told all the time what to do
C	where is this? is this in England?
B	yeah
C	mm it's not the one in
B	in
B	so erm I can't believe that and she feels well you know because it's daughter in law not
C	mm
B	son in law that
C	is the girls
B	it's very very very difficult for her to deal with and she can see that a lot of the struggles could be you know
C	yeah
B	helped along
C	yes
B	and erm I'm saying well get in the professionals because then at least they might take their advice but they actually aren't getting you know extra visits or anything and these babies were some ridiculously small weight
C	but don't they have to go to clinics to be weighed or
B	I expect so
C	don't people come round?
B	I expect so but no
C	they must still do that
B	but I don't think it's you know they could do with much more serious help than they're getting I think
C	well it's it's difficult enough having them fairly close together
B	mm mm
C	but yours were closer together than mine
B	mm the girls were yeah
C	mm
B	er having two exactly the same that's not going to be at all easy is it?
C	mm
B	so er mm in the old days
A	it's terrible we talk about the old days it's only our youth it sounds like we're talking about Victorian times
B	mm that's true
A	what do you mean when you say the old days?
B	mm
A	you mean our youth or do you mean
B	mm
A	way back?
C	I know ideas
A	I can't remember what you were saying
B	no I was conscious
B	of this recording
C	ideas change a little bit
C	don't they? cos when when we were young the thing was to put your baby out in the pram outside in the garden wasn't it?
A	mm I mean I mean
C	fresh air
A	yeah and er er a net over it
C	yeah
A	so the cats didn't go and sleep on its face
C	yeah but it's
A	yeah you'd
C	or you couldn't you couldn't hear them crying so they went to sleep
B	and we had to not lie the baby on its back but lie it on its side and now it's lie it on its back and yes you can sleep in the same bed if you're a
C	I think the other thing is they're meant to be in the same bedroom as you for six months in a cot
B	mm
A	they are meant to be or not?
C	I think that's the latest idea
A	oh
B	I think there are quite strong differences to
C	but they'll probably change their mind again
B	what's this notepad for?
A	nothing I was just gonna make some notes
A	does anyone need a another drink or something different to eat?
B	no
A	or something different to drink?
C	no I'm fine
B	it's because I can't have those biscuits that I've eaten some of course
A	oh you've eaten some?
B	yeah what's the attraction?
B	the attraction of carbohydrate is very strange isn't it?
C	if your body
B	cos that's what it is
C	thinks you should eat it you should eat it like
B	mm
C	like me and cake today
A	what cake?
C	er well
B	I shouldn't have cake
C	at work it was someone's birthday
A	but you're not gluten free or anything are you?
C	no I'm not gonna get into that sort of rubbish
B	it's not rubbish and you'll see was that
A	so why were you feeling guilty about the?
C	well
A	oh weight well you don't look er
C	mm
B	I'm just conscious of sitting down at work aren't you
C	I'm conscious of not moving around enough
A	mm so mm
B	you must do some sitting with your
A	mm yeah
A	yeah
C	it's not good really
A	I've been about three days I've been I dunno eighteen hours on the trot
B	oh my gosh
A	anyway what did you do at
B	er no I thought I was going to but I had all my I had what I could print off available er displays you've done in the recent past
C	so as
A	well what?
C	you've gone along you've taken photos have you?
B	oh yes I don't
C	that's good
B	if I take anything down I know
C	mm
B	otherwise you can't prove you've done it
C	mm
B	some people have taken some things down without my taking a photograph
C	mm
B	which upsets me greatly
C	mm
B	erm no I don't have to present it at all
A	so did you have a meeting?
B	I tried to but he just came out of his office and we walked around and discussed stuff and
C	so he
A	what approaching you to congratulate you?
C	he's
B	as oh er no as to what
C	he's mentioned it at a staff meeting to see
B	yeah yeah
C	yeah
B	so erm we've been talking erm you know which is what I always did before without all this other stuff erm we were talking
C	forty?
B	so forty boards mm
C	phew
B	about
C	so how often do they want them changed?
B	erm
C	mm
B	changing you know face so
A	but did you?
B	I shall just suggest that I have to do that
A	do you just put up what you want or is it?
B	no no no no
A	who who?
B	it's topic work er topic work and
A	for the whole school or for?
B	er yeah yeah nursery through to I do foundation stage key stage one and key stage two
A	no but just the topic
B	oh no the topics are they run
C	there's a new curriculum though isn't there? so will there be different new things to put up and?
B	er well we have a new systems of phonics yeah it's now called Sound Write
C	but the sort of things
B	not Read Write Inc so we're now doing Sound Write which I don't know much about I did listen in when I was outside in the corridor doing the boards
C	but history
B	we've got
C	history's changed hasn't it? different things that
B	erm
C	cos one of our teachers is going to Stonehenge for her topic
A	mm
C	so I don't know what
B	oh lovely
C	that is
B	mm
C	mm
B	great fun erm not sure
C	mm
B	erm
C	cos you can't sit down and that does it must keep her fit
B	oh I do
C	more than me sitting in a chair all day
B	I do a lot of stretching
A	so is that the academic year then you'll be there?
B	I think it's open because I haven't sent a contract
C	so what do you do
B	cos I don't really
C	just claim a monthly claim?
B	the hours I work
C	mm
B	yeah just I just claim the hours I work
A	and probably won't return
B	I think so
A	so what's morale like amongst the teachers that are there?
B	erm well the new ones have lifted
A	mm
B	because obviously they were it's now
A	now an academy
B	now yeah
A	mm
B	so we've got all sorts but we've got some really good new young teachers and of course those who have been there a while had lots and lots of changes and I think they are the ones who are not particularly coping well but the ones the one who haven't coped at all well of course aren't actually there so no and I think we've got the new good head I think he's good at the moment he's really listening so that's important isn't it? I think he's got a massive task I so couldn't be him
C	have to very big label
B	oh no they just don't bother to talk to me
A	I I'm the one who doesn't oh
B	so very senior people
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	so I've been shaking hands today I thought no I'm actually going to do this I think it's really weird
A	mm
B	and er he's now moved on to his secondary school and she was saying you know erm and what are you doing? I said oh just the display
B	so sweet so sweet I thought I'm not going to go into this but I have actually retired and this is you know an option but they're so sweet
C	with this new free school meals for infants
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	yes tell
B	only for infants is it it's not going to be for juniors?
C	it's reception reception year one and year two
B	mm
A	so everybody gets free school meals?
B	yeah
A	and who cooks it?
C	well it's where it's normally cooked
A	just keep talking but I'll be back
C	mm well
A	in just one second
C	our our meals are cooked at
[ANNOTATION]	Person C had forgotten about the social security	Contradiction
A	and is it like airline meals?
C	no it comes they serve them out onto plates
B	oh I see they they come but in large
C	they come in
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said that he is sure that they are coming	Neutral
C	a big er a heat proof box
B	mm mm
C	and we've got a heated servery so they put the food in there
B	mm
C	they've got those plastic plates have you got those? with compartments in them
B	mm
C	so they put puddings on with the
B	ours is cooked ours is cooked onsite
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said that they have to cook something like pudding	Entailment
C	yeah
B	but ours are cooked onsite
C	but
B	I didn't realise it wasn't going to involve the juniors
C	no
B	mm?
C	just over half because lots of young children are quite fussy
[ANNOTATION]	kids are particular	Entailment
B	mm so they've come with their own
C	they bring a lunchbox
B	erm yeah okay
C	they don't have to have it
B	so they're having sandwiches yeah
C	so they can bring sandwiches and the other thing is if erm they've got an older sibling in the juniors it would mean if the young one had a cooked meal the older one would probably say I want a cooked meal and if you can't afford it
B	mm mm
C	and the biggest take up did I tell you that? it's
B	mm
C	where there are more wealthy parents so they're all
B	mm
C	having the lunches and
B	mm
C	the poor fussy children are not having them
[ANNOTATION]	all children have the same lunch	Contradiction
B	mm
A	but why aren't they having them cos they don't like the food?
C	oh
B	may er they can
C	and they're fussy
B	but they could have those options they have the option of no
[ANNOTATION]	children are happy with their lunch	Contradiction
C	there is no option
B	no come on er
C	but the thing is at home they probably eat quite a limited range of food
A	so what do they eat?
C	they bring a lunchbox in
A	and what
B	yeah they're gonna have
A	and what's in the lunchbox?
[ANNOTATION]	the food at home come in a wide variety	Contradiction
B	they're gonna have sandwiches from home
C	sandwiches and
B	cos we've
C	rubbish food crisps and things
B	we've talked an awful lot at school about having healthy healthy lunchboxes
C	mm
B	masses and masses I'd like to do that again and start with the Start Write you know
C	I think I think the
[ANNOTATION]	some children's lunch is unhealthy	Entailment
B	start for
C	all these billions that are being spent should have been spent on educating mothers on doing lunchboxes and helping them
B	mm
C	I don't know how you do it but rather
A	I remember being shamed er by you when you used to cook
C	did I?
A	to put in their lunchbox yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the lunchboxes were all made my mothers	Neutral
B	flapjacks
A	cos I remember I
B	was it? oh okay
A	cos I remember I no no healthy ones
B	mm
A	not even flapjacks cos I used to sometimes buy those
C	I don't remember doing healthy stuff
A	you know the whatever it is you put in lunchboxes you buy what they want
C	well
A	very healthy
C	if they
A	no but you were sensible
C	chocolate cake I used to make it every day cos that's all he liked
A	chocolate cake?
C	yeah and he liked erm garlic sausage so he had garlic sausage sandwiches and chocolate cake every day
A	always the same?
C	virtually
A	gosh
C	six six
A	ridiculous
B	mm?
B	gosh terribly organised
A	and then and then they had to get them out
B	yeah
A	in the
B	yeah but also you were working
A	yeah I
C	mm
B	mm
A	but
C	I wish I'd been firmer getting them to do jobs but they never
B	you're quite firm with
C	he's quite happy to do it
A	does he?
C	mm
B	well not when he's actually doing a job which is a painting or whatever
C	he well he was he was well he was painting
B	that's a bit rough isn't it?
C	four days a week and doing cleaning the house on the fifth day
B	but he would still be doing
C	he's been doing the cooking for
B	mm oh so it's a good
C	and I do the laundry he is hanging stuff
B	mm
C	on the line now and getting it in folding it neatly
B	did he discover that himself or did you ask him to do it?
C	no he offers
A	so what kind of menus do you have what sort of meals do you have?
C	well I quite often have roast on Sunday and then have some heated up
unknown_female	hi
B	hiya
C	heated that up when I
B	are you gonna come and join in?
A	you must be hungry
unknown_female	er no I'll eat something later dear when you're finished
A	oh no okay
unknown_female	yeah hi
B	hello come on then come in and cook
unknown_female	well I'm no I'll be in in a minute
B	okay
unknown_female	what's she say on there?
unknown_female	yeah
C	we had Polish sausages we have casseroles he makes
A	always advertising
C	chops and things we always have meat virtually every day cos his Polish meat
B	cos
B	I do
C	always
B	a lot of cooking for two days on my own
C	well that's two days that's quite often it's it's good that
B	mm I find when you have people round for supper as I did on Saturday you cook far too much and then you can eat the rest of it
C	mm
B	for a long time afterwards
C	mm some days
B	I'm very into garlic
C	mushrooms can be tricky
B	mm
C	eating I don't know if I can actually eat them really
B	mm?
C	I think I get aching bones when I eat mushrooms
B	mm? I'm alright with those it sounds like it's the yeast in it
C	yeah I think so I
B	mm
C	I found that
B	you're very particular with your meals aren't you? do you organise them when you go shopping once a week sort of thing?
C	yeah
B	mm I'm much more
C	we always have a fried breakfast on Saturday and Sundays
B	mm I'm much more about what is the yellow label or what's the deal at the time
C	well I do buy deals and put them in the freezer
B	and then you can plan them in for your next time
C	mm
B	terribly organised
C	so what sort of things do you eat then
A	I don't know
B	no I'm not I've had enough
A	well I'll give you some lemonade
C	do you plan or do you just go to the shop and get something?
A	both really
C	mm
A	I'm quite into cooking when I've got time at the moment
C	I'm not because I've
A	and not so much meat I don't really like
B	I'm having fish
A	I like good meat
B	I've been told to have more oily fish
A	where do you buy your meat?
C	I quite I think the meat in Sainsbury's isn't too bad their steak and erm joints and things in the butcher's counter
A	mm
B	well I do eat a bit of
C	they're quite expensive
A	yeah I I do sometimes but
B	mm
A	we don't eat meat more than twice a week
C	no don't you?
B	don't you? what do you have instead fish?
A	well we eat fish fish
B	yeah I like fish
A	and then sometimes if I do
B	well you've still got to find something
A	sort of erm I dunno stuffed aubergines or
B	mm
C	mm
A	in the summer
B	mm
A	who did you go to? did you go to
B	erm
A	that same lady that
B	mm I did because I couldn't get I had been going to
A	to who?
A	oh
B	for years
A	is that
B	no but I couldn't get in an appointment with her she got to be so difficult and I rang
A	cos she's supposed to be very good isn't she?
B	she's great I know erm
C	I don't believe in it at all
B	you don't have to
C	and
A	I do cos I see how well
B	mm
A	keeping off
C	well I think
A	no I well I don't know about that
B	she has masses of other serious
C	well what sort of
A	well she's just too busy in life
B	mm oh yeah
A	she she should slow down
B	yeah but she takes she takes joy in it though
A	erm
B	she takes pleasure out of
A	yeah I just think sometimes she gets
B	pleasure out of a lot of things grandchildren and stuff
A	yeah but she gets onto all these committees and she
B	mm but then
C	it's too much
B	but she chooses to do that
A	chapel and church
B	she chooses to do that
A	yeah but I don't think she should
B	oh I see I see what you mean
A	you know go along and enjoy it but not erm organise it which is
C	mm you need some people who just likes organising don't they
A	I never see her cos she's always erm
B	well we could never see you you were always busy
A	ah but that's because I'm working
B	mm
A	but she kind of retired through
C	health and
B	and then
A	and should really be slowing down and
B	mm
C	but she's been better since she retired though hasn't she?
A	and enjoy her life
B	thank you
C	with her aching muscles and things
B	thank you well that's also because she's changed her diet which you don't believe in but it has made a difference to her
C	not at all
B	it has made a difference
A	no I think
C	well I do I
A	food
C	I eat meat all the time don't I?
A	well that's not necessarily unhealthy but if you were to eat lots of cream cakes and biscuits for a whole day
C	I'd get fat
A	well it's not only that you'd feel
B	you would feel differently
A	differently and it's just that you don't do it so that when you have someone who has a pretty bad or probably a very healthy diet but supplements it with
C	and
B	yeah but
C	but what I don't understand is
A	eating healthy food
C	what sort of test if the medical profession
B	thank you
C	can't test for it how can these quacks test for it?
B	well you've straight away judged them by calling them a quack haven't you? So
C	yeah but how do they test it?
B	you've already decided
C	I mean
B	they are as medically and
C	a proper
B	they are as medically qualified in a different way
C	but if
B	yeah but if your doctor is
C	that's what I don't understand
A	but doctors probably can
B	there are just different kind of doctors
A	but they just can't be you know they haven't got the the resources to do it
C	you get allergy doctors and people
B	mm
A	mm but this isn't allergies
B	cos it's more serious than that
A	if you go to an allergy doctor it's to see if you're
B	if you if you were to eat a food that rushed straight through your body and made it impossible for you to leave home you would stop eating it wouldn't you?
C	er probably but I might think I've got Crohn's disease or something like that
B	I think she's been tested for those things
C	and that's gluten in wheat?
B	yes it's wheat
C	mm
B	and
C	but everybody can't be allergic to gluten which is what it sounds like in
A	no but it's a new phenomenon it's now isn't it? it's all it's er
C	but every it wouldn't be possible for everybody to be allergic to gluten
A	but we didn't have
B	erm
A	I thought I thought it was because it's imported from
B	it's because yes because America has been erm
A	America
B	and they've been supplementing all these you know like when you buy a erm an oatcake if you look on it you'll see that actually it contains wheat now and that's because it's much cheaper to produce
C	but this gluten
A	but isn't it tampered with? erm if you go to sort of countries that are growing their own wheat
B	mm I suspect if you were yeah doing
A	and if you eat bread there you're absolutely fine
B	organically or yeah yeah
C	but people have trouble with bread here because they don't let it rise properly do they
B	it has preservatives in it all sorts of things
C	and it's got all sorts of things in it
B	mm that's what
C	that's not the flour it's the
B	that's what
C	it's the way it's made rather than what it actually is
B	if you aren't having trouble with any foods then it's fine but if you if you're
C	well I probably am
B	but if you're
A	well you're not
B	but if you
A	because you're not rushing to the loo all the time
C	I do sometimes if I've got
B	but that isn't the that isn't the only consequence
C	so what did she test you with to prove it?
B	erm well
A	well why do they they don't need to test you do I mean I I
B	ask you all sorts of questions for a start
A	surely you can just start eating
C	I mean they'd just tell everybody they're allergic this is just taking the
A	yeah that's if you're if you that's if you're inverted commas normal but if you has a have a
C	well
A	they drink cow's milk
A	they
C	doctors
A	feel ill
C	will say
A	mm
C	can be tested can't it though
A	no
C	cos they can't digest it genetically
B	you know your
C	can't digest it
B	you know your daughter in law is very
C	Kimchi
B	yeah so she doesn't like to do without it and that's what's
C	that's
B	that's what's er I think
C	gets rid of the bacteria
B	what's happened in western diets is that there's an awful lot of wheat in it
A	and dairy
B	erm I bought I was bought up entirely on erm masses and masses of all that sort of stuff we had loads of
C	well you might be lactose intolerant which could be tested properly that would prove it to you
B	well fine I don't mind if I am tested properly
A	mm
B	I'm quite happy with the present testing but yes
A	but also the milk that you were drinking as a child would have come straight from the farm
B	mm okay
A	but you know you you look at the milk you're buying nowadays
B	mm
A	goodness knows what
B	it still was I think it was
A	happens to it
B	only tuberculosis tested I don't think it was anything else and then it would just go through the cooler and be
A	yeah and you'd drink it
B	yeah pasteurised it wasn't I guess was it none of those things
C	there was something on television a couple of nights ago and they testing
B	mm
C	bacteria
A	mm
C	when we were younger and now
B	you do need certain
C	if we tried to eat it
B	you do need certain
C	probably couldn't now
B	mm
A	well it's like all these allergies people who have got asthma and erm
C	but maybe people always had it but there was
A	but young kids that no I think cos when we were just
C	outside
A	you know we we were outside we played on the floor in filth we ate
C	mm
A	filth ate worms even
C	yeah
A	I was a child and now they're so overprotected
C	and why
A	and
C	why are people
A	all this
C	allergic to peanuts when people in places like Malaysia where they eat peanuts in everything
B	mm
C	why are British babies and children can't eat peanuts?
B	well there are children in my school that are allergic to peanuts who are not British
C	I know so
B	but that has a very serious consequence it's not just a question of
C	well it can kill you
B	exactly so if you have that kind of shock
C	but we didn't hear about that when we were children did we?
A	no
B	well maybe we didn't know the cause of that shock did we? If someone had died in that way like having a bee sting that you're
A	and how many peanuts did did we have in our childhood?
B	wouldn't have been in our diet
C	we probably didn't have peanuts but then we
B	and so they wouldn't have been in our diet
C	we didn't have peanuts butter but lots of people did have peanut butter didn't they?
A	I remember having peanut butter
C	mm
B	what as a child?
A	well teens I think it came in
B	I don't remember it all you see my
C	I don't remember peanuts or
B	my
A	or perhaps a student
C	but we used to eat far
B	that's good
C	we used to eat a lot of carbohydrates because we used to have cooked puddings at school
A	mm
C	and at home
A	but we used to do a lot of sport
C	erm cakes
A	and exercising
C	and
A	and walking
C	biscuits
B	that's right we were busy weren't we?
A	mm
B	mm
C	we didn't eat as many things as things like crisps
A	well there weren't crisps really were there?
C	there were with the little blue bags in it
A	oh and the salt packet
C	they were a special treat
B	that's right
A	they weren't every day
B	I think that's the difference
C	and I think pizzas are really
B	is that we didn't have so many treats
C	bad for people the they're fattening
A	what?
C	pizza
A	mm
C	I think that's why kids are fat
B	do you not make them anymore?
C	mm I used to make them for children but
B	mm if you make your own it would be better but it's still
C	well I used to make my own
B	still lots of erm carbs isn't it rather than too much anything else
C	we used to eat we used to eat
B	mm
C	in fact you still get that in Poland they give it to you as erm a free kind of starter bread with a dripping pot with erm bits of meat erm
C	at the bottom it's really nice
B	mm my dad used to save all the meat
C	but it's a cold country in the winter
A	mm
C	so people need to eat fat
A	mm
C	mm
B	from erm
A	but probably very healthy
B	mm
C	well
B	really?
C	cos you know her wartime travels don't you?
A	mm
C	I've told you that you know prisoner in Siberia and in recent years we found out that she had to travel down through Kazakhstan lost at least one child if not two and ended up in Africa in a hospital working and they had the choice of going to America Britain or back to Poland and she had to come to Britain because she'd got a bucket of fat that she could take on the boat
A	that she'd saved up
C	been saving
B	mm
C	mm
A	what and only the boat would allow it?
C	mm couldn't take it on a plane could she to America
B	I really admire her endurance
C	mm
A	would they have gone on planes in those days?
C	oh they probably wouldn't would they? they'd gone on a
A	mm mm
C	whatever it was that's when
A	but she was only allowed to take it to Britain
C	whatever it was I can't remember the details now but
A	mm
C	she had a very tough life
B	has any of it been written down?
C	erm their
B	bless her
C	mm
B	so in the end she had had more children but in the end there was
C	yeah
C	I did say to her once what was the name of your baby? and she couldn't remember she went
B	mm
C	I don't know
B	mm
A	who was this
A	mother?
C	mm
A	so by the time she came to Britain and settled how was she when she had
C	erm
A	so these are actually
C	yeah
B	mm and what happened
B	to
C	well the story of the war was they were living in eastern Poland and the Russians were on the other side and they took them prisoners and they were going to shoot
B	mm
C	doing things like that
A	so where were they reunited in
C	and I think it must have been in this country don't know where or how cos
B	what a shame
C	too late
B	mm
A	mm
B	I have
A	mm
B	they've got muddled it's really frustrating you should write it down
C	yeah we should write it down
B	cos mm what an amazing
C	and there are
B	family though
C	on the internet you can find ships with the lists of the passengers on them that came back they can't find a name on
B	mm
C	she was a happy person didn't have to go to a counsellor
B	mm she was probably grateful for each day
C	bad arthritis possibly from being in the cold in Siberia I don't know
B	but if you've lived through all that
C	I think she just didn't look backwards
B	yeah but in if you live through all that you are going to
C	lived for for the children
C	mm
A	well I think also here they were very welcoming to Poles
C	yeah
A	so there wasn't this sort of erm
C	well they'd fought for this country
A	problem of being foreigners or whatever
C	and my family's connection with them was that erm have I told you about my mother and a Pole?
A	no
B	thank you
C	with him or not? and the we've got her diaries with and
A	this is your mother then?
C	this is my mother
C	cos he was always making nasty remarks about Poles all through our young life
B	cos of your mother?
C	and he was they had a fight he'd say and what were you doing in nineteen forty-two?
C	it cropped up all the time when we were young
B	mm
A	mm
C	they were always fighting
B	mm
C	but they stayed together
A	and accepted
C	yeah they liked him
A	mm
C	my dad said to me he's too good for you
C	it's usually the other way round isn't it?
C	no no no that I was going out with him then and he was down for the weekend or something and we went to see my sister no we lived in I lived in London in a house and there was a party over the road
A	really?
C	he came in and I seemed to rather like tall blonde blokes I'd had a tall blonde German boyfriend and my friend said to me he looks your type you could probably make him lose weight
C	never managed that
C	so that's where we met
B	locations usually are decided by work aren't they?
A	mm
B	which is why I'm always amused that you know people get qualified as teachers or whatever and expect to work
C	mm locally
B	yeah and it you know I I who would have thought I would have ended up in London it so wasn't anywhere I had ever planned to go and not live and work
C	it's difficult for young professionals now isn't it that if you're both got a job the chances are you're not gonna find one in the same place are you?

C	unless you're very lucky
A	mm that's right
C	what does
