A	mm
B	and it broke it would you know its steel band would keep it all together
A	oh
B	so we went and
A	galvanised being
B	galvanised it's got to be galvanised
A	yeah
B	that means that it's dipped in a molten bath of zinc
A	oh yeah
B	it's cleaned with acid and then dipped in a molten bath of zinc
A	cos we often well sometimes use the word I was galvanised into action
B	yes
A	doesn't really
A	which made me move
B	make you run wouldn't it?
B	well there's galvanic action
A	it's got a specific specific erm
B	mm
A	mm

B	well that's what they're changing it to yes
A	mm
B	which is fine by me it's great good idea

B	oh
A	erm I'll pop in there anyway it doesn't look very big
B	oh yeah?
A	I'll pop in just to
B	yeah
A	just to see and there was this old Arab guy sitting at the desk
B	right
A	and I said
B	yes as they do
A	yes and er
B	yes
A	and I
B	belt
A	oh erm
B	no that's not it
A	well where's it gone?
B	I dunno

B	oh right I've got it right on then
A	so he he's chatting the chatting
B	yeah
A	and er
B	oh right
A	and how that he comes from Jordan and over there if you
B	well that's handy
A	so honest he showed me his passport
B	yes
A	and there's no date of birth on there
B	oh right
B	amazing
A	yeah er he's telling me about his family he's got five daughters erm they've all put have gone to college got masters one's

A	a solicitor and one works with him and all the rest of it
B	yes
A	and it started it it
B	oh right

A	and then was transferred to the air force
B	right
A	and at one stage had thirty thousand thirty-two thousand men
B	good god
A	yeah and how er he's er
B	yes
A	and you know all the the
B	yes
A	he was telling me about er over here he's got three masters degrees and he went to
B	right
B	oh yeah?
A	there was a talk he was giving at Sussex University to a a group of people who have come er from all over the world or something
B	yes
A	so I know it wasn't bullshit you know he he's a straight up guy
B	yes
A	and while he's making the coffee I saw these framed certificates on the wall
B	oh yeah?
A	er of how he's er an agent for all these different organisations
B	yes
A	one of who is Kaplan you know you've heard me talk about them erm they're er a placement agency for lots of universities and things like that
B	oh yeah?
A	and er he had three or four of these on the wall er so I
B	yeah
A	he showed me the letter I thought it was er to start with it was to check his English
B	yeah
A	and I I started and I said well the
B	yeah
A	which is pretty much what the the woman used to do on erm who was my next door neighbour who gave me the office you know?
B	right
A	and er
B	brilliant
A	yeah
B	yeah great great
A	and
B	oh yeah?
A	and she said oh can you do my
B	oh great yeah
A	I said yeah okay so
B	do you need any books for that?
A	well yes but they've got one she said er in the school there where I can get photocopies from
B	oh right
A	because there's not much in
B	yeah
A	and I thought well that's
B	right
A	and it's er right behind
B	there you go
A	so I said oh okay
B	yeah
A	it's er you get paid I think eight pound fifty for one interview and eight pound for a writing script
B	right
A	and what most of the examiners do they they do boo both speaking and writing but I never used to do writing
B	right
A	because you in China you have to be on BC premises that means you have to live in one of the four centres
B	right
A	like in Shanghai you you have to go actually go there so that's why he works there so what examiners do is that you only get about
B	right
A	and that's how they they make their money in a day
B	yeah
A	erm but it it wouldn't be worth it for me cos I'd
B	right
A	still
B	right
A	marking accurately and then you can go for the full but in like in China you go for the weekend you stay in a five star hotel
B	yeah
A	and er you do thirty interviews for the weekend and er you know get about four hundred quid
B	fucking nora
A	for the erm for the weekend
B	that's amazing
A	but here it's it just doesn't seem like it's worth it you know? if if it's in Brighton it would be worth it but not not going up to London
B	if someone's sick
A	is calls in sick
B	yeah
A	and they she'll call me up
B	yeah
A	like half an hour's notice and say oh can you
B	oh
A	come in straight away and do it of course you
B	god
A	you've got to wing it
B	yeah
A	oh you're brilliant
A	what was wrong with it?
B	well in there
A	mm
B	no open it
A	here?
B	well that is hollow and in the back of there's a magnet
A	yeah
B	and the magnet is not a fixed it's loose in there it's
A	ah
B	what happen is the magnet gets loose because it's loose it can jam up in there
A	oh and that's what happened?
B	and the magnet jammed up in there
A	oh you clever chap thank you very much
B	that's alright
A	put it on my bill?
B	yeah okay
A	so erm anyway
B	I thought you didn't do writing
A	yeah but I can teach it
B	examine it
A	I can't be an examiner
B	oh I see
A	but
B	yes
A	concept because er
B	yes
A	but not here
B	no
A	anyway
B	brilliant
A	since
B	how much is that?
A	oh it's not very much it's about fourteen and a half quid but it'll be even less than that
B	what for an hour?
A	yeah
B	fourteen and a half quid?
A	yeah
B	that's all you get for Monday morning?
A	well for an hour for
B	twenty-one quid
A	yeah
B	do you get travelling?
A	no of course not no
B	right
A	and erm
B	where's this in
A	no
B	right
A	I can walk there in fifteen minutes
B	oh that's just along the the the
A	by the arcade
B	by the arcade yeah gotcha
A	so and it's a
B	of course
A	it's a first
B	oh absolutely
A	you know it's
B	I'm I'm I'm fully behind you there
A	so
B	I'm not bemoaning the dosh I just think it's brilliant
A	mm
B	you know you've got er
A	oh yeah I forgot I forgot to tell you when I was talking to this guy this Arab guy he's called
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	I said what would this be er in the Middle East? he said yes probably maybe a er
B	yeah
A	I said and I was sort of very thinking very quickly and I said well I've already
B	did he give you a an email address?
A	well I've got his card
B	right
A	where is it?
B	well that's fantastic
A	mm
B	if he can get you something sorted out with er
A	yeah well
B	whatever
A	it's erm
B	yes
A	and I said whenever I get a new student I cos they always think or hope that they can
B	right
A	you know and I tell them straight away like it is you know it's it takes a lot of study
B	yes
A	to improve your standard of English you're not gonna do it it's not gonna be done quickly
B	no
A	er so that's the way I work I try and be honest and fair you know and tell them like it is from the start
B	of course
A	erm
B	yes
A	and er er in a week or two I'll pop in and just say hi and just do
A	you know is if he's still giving talks at you know at
B	on what?
A	oh he's just telling welcoming everybody who come and er for the er talk and
B	what's he talking on about?
A	well it was just welcoming people to the reason what they're I don't know what the reason was everybody
B	right
A	and obviously I'm everything he told me I believed
B	right
A	you know he's obviously been er some different stages in his life a very important man
B	yeah
A	so I don't think it was bullshit
B	that sounds wonderful
A	it was right quite a positive day
B	absolutely yeah
A	got a potential
B	yeah
A	and got my first
B	fantastic
A	for months so
B	that's brilliant
A	can't complain really
B	brilliant
A	mm
B	I would have thought though you could have commanded more money from than going in or on the chance of doing something for being called in for an emergency to cover is for fourteen quid an hour is seems to me
A	it's it's
B	crazy
A	it is
B	sure yeah
A	because I've got nothing else to do
B	yeah
A	except write off for jobs and it's gonna get me out of the house it's gonna get me teaching again
B	yes
A	thinking about teaching
B	yes
A	I'm gonna make contacts
B	yes
A	and
B	sure yeah no that's true that's true
A	so
B	for sure
A	I know it's it's pitiful money
B	it seems outrageous
A	it is
B	is it bad? did he say it was bad then?
A	well he he told me that he'd he'd he's trying for all sorts of things writing off and he mentioned that er as far as driving jobs go he's
B	yeah
A	he he said well they'll just give me a chance and I'll even pay half the er increased cost of the insurance
B	uhu
A	yeah if they take him on and that kind of thing so I think he's pretty desperate to
B	to work
A	to get work
B	yeah I'm sure he is
A	and he
B	I'm sure he is yeah I just yeah
A	mm
B	you know
A	well
B	I I
A	you know
B	I I I I've lived with people who just fucking lie
A	well I mean I don't know
B	and I just
A	maybe he is but I
B	so no no no no I but I I'm I I I tend to go along with what you think about it but
A	I think he is trying
B	yeah I'm sure yeah
A	but yesterday the positive thing he was er said er you know hello to him and said oh how are you? he said oh I'm find yeah so it's like he said yeah I feel a lot better I said oh that's good and I went yes yes er and erm not that anything particular happened I think he's just
B	that's good
A	I said er you know I said oh good you know well done erm I said you know some people look they look at a situation and they see a problem and other people they look at it and they see an opportunity so
B	yeah
A	and he said yeah absolutely so it seems like he's got his motivation there you know like he he seemed like he was down the other day
B	yeah
A	he seems a lot better in that er aspect or respect
B	that's good
A	and er
B	well maybe it was partly the job getting him down
A	I don't know I I didn't ask him about you know did he leave or was he pushed
B	yes
A	I thought well if he if he wants me to know he'll tell me you know
B	what?
A	you know
B	do what?
A	everybody saying it
B	yes
A	all levels of society right from
B	yes
A	those people on benefits that we were listening to in the
B	yes
A	right up to interviewers on national TV
B	yes
A	you know what does it mean?
B	what do you prefer? do you prefer that or the American rising rising inflection?
A	you know?
B	rising
A	you know? erm
B	what is it you
A	well it's not just American
B	well
A	it's er Australians speak like that as well
B	well there you go
A	as well?
B	both both fucking annoying people
B	I think it's it's searching for reassurance that the person who's being told the information or the story is following it and understanding it and I think I believe they're they're they're asking for
A	mm
B	confirmation
A	confirmation
B	of that
A	mm
B	so it may be the that erm and there's also a certain sense of something you know sharing about it
A	mm
B	when they say you know you know it's rather like
A	mm yeah
B	having a fag together
A	yeah
B	or a beer it's you know you're you're joining in a story and
A	mm
B	you're becoming you're you're sort of bonding
A	it's to encourage
B	people's common experience
A	it's to encourage active listening
B	yeah
A	just sitting there and
B	yes
A	active listening is when you're involved and you you do some
B	yeah
A	response oh yes you know or things like this you know
B	unless
A	yes I agree or
B	unless the person talking is also addressing their their erm
A	mm
B	I don't know
A	mm
B	there's something to think about
A	mm
B	wow
A	well I'm sure some academic has written some paper on it
[ANNOTATION]	no one wrote about active listening	Contradiction
B	what instead of saying comparable to?
A	well again it it's it's it doesn't serve much
A	communicative purpose it's just a habit that people copy
B	is
A	all the
B	well that's what the kids say now
A	do they still do it?
B	yes oh yes
A	yes oh okay
B	no they don't say that
A	no they don't say it any more
[ANNOTATION]	there are papers on active listening	Entailment
B	that's old-fashioned
A	yeah so every generation's got its er
B	I say it to them because to my son and use as many obtuse words that I can remember from my youth because it makes him and his friends giggle
B	and he says people don't say that any more dad
B	so I I
A	just old farts like you
B	it encourages it to
A	mm
A	well I suppose I'd better get back to my emails
B	great good that's good well done
A	good
[ANNOTATION]	email is an old word	Neutral
B	unbelievable just I think I knew it would I knew it fucking would I
A	yeah
B	I mean that's but if you eat raw vegetables that's the best thing you can eat
A	mm
B	it gives you so much energy
A	mm it's almost like your body's saying oh thank you at last
[ANNOTATION]	raw vegetables are good for health	Entailment
B	it is yes
A	I've got some good things to nourish on
B	it is yeah
A	yeah
B	well I think I'm
A	okay
B	I'm going going to go and have a kip
[ANNOTATION]	raw vegetables are nourishing	Entailment
A	really? okay
B	what?
A	okay I've put some clothes that were dry from over there on your bed
B	oh thanks
A	okey-dokey then go and have your kip mate
B	right
A	you deserve it
