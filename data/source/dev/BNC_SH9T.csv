A	so haven't exactly written more than you then
B	you wrote a whole page for the second question
A	the third question
B	the second one
A	what was the second question?
B	erm the author the writer structures the text
A	no erm
B	oh erm how does the author use language to create a sense of the weather or something like that
A	oh yeah
B	what did you put for that? I put
A	shaking like a drunken man
B	yeah did that and I did the wind sometimes
A	yeah with it round a corner or
B	no no it was it was I well I did it and then I said it sort of the but the wind was grabbing it and shaking it around and then what was the third one? the structure
A	the structure how does the author structure the text to interest to
B	I didn't like that one
A	what did you put for that?
B	I put erm
A	oh yeah what I
B	but I just sort of rambled I rambled too much
A	yeah so did I I rambled
B	and so I kept just talking about it was zooming in on this and on that and in on that and was so I'm gonna read it through tomorrow or whenever else when we have English
A	yeah
B	and then I'm going to be like oh that take didn't go very well
A	what did you do for the four things erm the erm
B	oh yeah the weather?
A	yeah the four things about the weather or something the first question
B	I did it was cold and grey um misty
A	cold
B	clammy cold and like something rain I can't remember
A	oh yeah it's like
B	mizzling rain yeah I did that I don't know what mizzling means
A	neither do I
B	yeah and then
A	oh yeah something to do with metaphor and
B	yeah something that word
B	analogy
A	oh yeah
B	that's it yeah but erm I don't know what that means either
A	neither do I
B	so many words
A	so many words like I bet she she understood everything like if you gave her this text with like
B	I dunno a nineteen fifteen novel
A	yeah just with random words she'd know what all of them were
B	yeah she'd know like whenever we did the definitions on the board she always knows what they are Miss
A	oh does anyone know they
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B does not how to use some of the words they mention in a figurative way.	Neutral
B	anyone know what they are? and she's
A	and then whenever you ask her she won't explain it she's actually quite nice she's not that bad
[ANNOTATION]	She is the best teacher they have.	Neutral
B	she's nice yeah
A	because she does explain things to you and stuff
A	like if you ask her like what does this random word mean? she'd know exactly what it meant and explain it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she only put one and I was like no no no no down to the down to the foot and I was like
A	I was yeah erm and
B	yeah
A	she never really measures it
B	follows it she's more good at observation
A	yeah like when she's drawing that face she didn't like you know erm Miss
[ANNOTATION]	The teacher is really good at providing good explanations of things the students do not know.	Entailment
B	yeah and
A	and she can kind of make it look right without doing
B	just by treasuring little stuff yeah
A	yeah it's like whenever I draw a face I have to do like the cross thing so I know where the eyes are
B	yeah same
A	I start with the face cos
B	yeah I start with the eyes
A	I do the face shape and cross and then I start with the eyes
B	I used to do that but then Miss
[ANNOTATION]	The teacher is very skilled at drawing things	Contradiction
A	yeah she said that to us but I didn't do it
B	oh
A	yeah but you can't do it when you're doing the thing because you need to have the head size to be able to measure out the proportion
B	yeah but I think
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	When drawing a face, Speaker B first does the eyes.	Entailment
B	because I I find that quite hard and I can't do the I'm not very good at the erm eyes and the mouth and nose and stuff
A	yeah
B	I asked her
A	yeah
B	what was I going to say?
B	have you have you looked at the French thing? have you done that?
A	which one what
B	the paragraphs that we have to do do we not have to learn that?
A	well well we don't because they're not going to see us because they're just gonna see this thing so it doesn't matter
A	yeah so it doesn't matter if
A	oh yeah I don't have any
B	and you have to neither do I
A	we can get some
B	and I need to remember to bring my Iphone on that day to record but I don't have Imovie on my Iphone
A	yeah well then you can send your clips to me I can get it on the Mac and then
B	I've got it I've got Imovie on my Ipad
A	oh yeah well it is better on the Mac cos then we can do it easier and you can come round and we can do it
B	okay
A	and if I realised if the sound isn't very good so if you just hear like background noise you can always use this microphone and just record our voices again
B	oh yeah and just have the
A	just have the picture and record like a track over the top
B	and mute that one
A	yeah yeah
B	I was with
A	oh yeah
B	there there was
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	she's friends with
A	yeah
B	she's not actually pretty
A	everyone says she's pretty
B	I've only like seen her once and like
B	yeah but
B	makeup on
A	no she doesn't take dance
A	her first
B	her first option then art then
A	but when's she actually gonna use dance though?
B	and if you wanna be a dancer you have to go to stage school and
A	yeah you have to
B	and you have do proper training having a a dance GCSE isn't really going to be a dance teacher
A	yeah
B	it doesn't really help anything but she's taking she's taking dance art philosophy and ethics and
A	yeah why does she want to do
B	and like French or something I
A	yeah
B	because I don't know
A	well she likes philosophy and ethics I don't oh
B	Miss
A	oh yeah something like that
B	yeah
A	like PSHE day
B	yeah twice every two weeks why should be doing something a bit more important like maths
A	yeah why don't we just
B	or English
A	or get that time to work on triple science or something
B	yeah or something a bit more important
A	yeah
B	get the time to revise or I don't know go and talk to teachers about it
A	mm yeah
B	instead of doing random and it's not even like we're taking a GCSEs
A	erm
B	four lessons every two weeks I think it's the same or five five I think every two weeks for PE
A	at the moment we have four
B	yeah but I think next year we have five that's what they said but I don't understand why unless you're taking GCSE PE
A	yeah
A	I bet
B	and
A	yeah before
B	food tech
A	was she going to take food tech? I didn't think she was going to
B	I think she was I think she was going to take art music food tech and business and business was going to be her first choice
A	mm
B	and something what's she taking now?
A	oh she's I don't think she's taking art is she?
A	is she in your art?
B	no
A	yeah so she isn't taking art anymore I didn't think she was going to take food tech but if she was then I guess that's also one
B	she'll be taking exactly the same as
A	yeah she will cos she just follows her around
A	and
B	okay
A	shall we stop it?
B	yeah
A	bye
A	oh slide to unlock okay
