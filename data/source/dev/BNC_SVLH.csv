B	well yeah obviously I wouldn't want and it's
A	how you behave with your friends that you know
B	cos when did I see
A	oh right
C	er you know that
B	he was really good then actually though he was really well behaved and really helped out a lot
A	mm I can imagine
B	I showed
A	oh god
B	it was brilliant
C	he's a little shit isn't he?
B	yeah because
B	all the kids were just like
C	and
A	oh right
C	yeah go on
B	all the kids were just leaving and
B	he helped out all night
B	and
A	as usual
C	right
B	he literally sat on his phone as well at one point
A	you what?
B	literally sat on his phone at one point
A	oh he does
C	yeah that
A	yeah
C	how old is he?
B	isn't he in
A	yeah I think so
B	so
A	then
B	two years younger than me and a year older than
A	than
B	so seventeen turning eighteen this year
C	well
A	well he must be seventeen now
C	yeah he's seventeen now cos he's just passed his test
A	is his name
B	no
A	what was his name?
B	there was a
C	I don't know
A	it wasn't
B	no
C	oh no it wasn't
B	I can't remember what it was
A	no I can't now that you've asked
B	well I don't know I've literally just put on the chart I think we need to have a exec meeting so
A	right
B	so that's er I don't know why when we made the change they changed it oh er oh actually no I do
A	right
B	him look good
A	but like it's alright making him look good but he's gotta get off his backside and do a bit
B	I know cos like
A	yeah
B	cos I'm the chairperson
A	that's
B	yeah
A	and I think he'll do less and less now he's working
B	everything is like oh but I've got a job
A	mm
B	I'm working
A	yeah I think it will be
B	then when he wasn't working it was like yeah but I can have a massive lie in and do whatever I
A	it's always better than yours
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	if he was unemployed it was great because he could lie in and he could do whatever he want whenever he wanted but now he's got a job it's great because he's earning loads of money and he's gonna be dead rich
A	needs to grow up a bit really
B	and then he was moaning about the tax the other day
A	why?
B	just cos he's not been taxed before has he? so
A	well welcome to the real world
C	I know
A	mm
C	all this
A	oh they won't send him back they won't they know you can't have him back
C	mm
A	if they can't cope with him when they've got people coming in for eight hour shifts then going home how can you cope with him twenty-four seven?
C	mm that's right yeah
A	they won't they won't do that
B	they won't they'll never do that
C	mm
A	and there's other places they're refusing him saying that they'd never be able to cope with him
C	yeah
A	they're
C	no
A	if the worst comes to the worst they'll section him
C	I know but that's what er
A	it is a last resort
C	what about the
B	what what is
C	it's it's the where the doctor comes from
A	I think it's part of the hospital really
C	but you know I can't think who it was that said you know
A	it is but then if there's nowhere else what do you do?
B	it's hard for both sides cos it's er you can't
A	well
B	like you say like it's hard for you to have to travel to
A	no no
B	that he has a unique condition that's ended up being like this they can't like
A	I fail to believe that it's unique to be honest
C	no it is I don't think
B	well I do but like what else
C	that's what
B	it just seems it to me
