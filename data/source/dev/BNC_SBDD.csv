B	oh what's that your uh
A	this is a
B	is that the one that you just started or?
A	it's another chicken
B	that one of your  one of your  collection of chickens?
A	what I think I might do is like at work um thought I might like give them to some people with a little
B	well that is quite a good idea uh well creative anyway
A	yeah well like
B	just like as as a present so
A	well just cos like why not
B	uh and then afterwards you might be able to use it as a as an egg warmer
A	egg warmer
B	um
A	I'm sure people would like them
B	what does an egg warmer? Like when do you when would you use that?
A	like when you've made a boiled egg in between eating the boiled egg and dish putting it on the plate like
A	that's when I suppose
B	what? The idea of having a a coat for an egg or the idea of making a little chick and giving it to people with uh with a Cr√®me Egg inside it?
B	well it's the unstoppable force of creativity
A	well I can't just help I can't help myself can I?
B	no uh it seems that you you um you know you you have to make chickens um yeah
A	well not just chickens
B	uh yeah
A	guerrilla knitting
B	yeah um
A	well just got my
B	you pretty much started from from nothing didn't you about a a year or so ago?
A	yeah I mean I've knitted before then but only like
B	what's increase and decrease what's that?
A	like so you know if you were knitting a jumper or something? You might wanna make it narrower towards the top or
B	oh yeah
A	it's like adding more stitches
B	yeah
A	yeah I mean I've just done more experimenting I think
B	oh right well
B	of um of uh knitting
A	you should see some of me nana's knitting then you'll know how much of a beginner I am like
B	what kinda stuff does she do then?
A	well some of them are baby things like
B	oh I see
A	it's probably why old old ladies can't bloody see a bat cos they've spent hours like poring
B	can't see a they can't see a bat
A	can't see can't even see a bat
A	they
B	right yeah
A	exactly
B	what and they're also diddly
A	twiddly and diddly bits yeah
B	uh
A	apparently she's made a lot for
B	the the new yeah yeah yeah
A	baby
B	yeah
A	I wondered about maybe watching that Silent Witness thing
B	it was uh
A	dominion of Death or whatever it was
B	yeah yeah and uh actually yeah
A	I can make a little
B	D'you
A	I'll just knit you a whole like um like a jump like a jump suit in maybe in that colour what d'you think? Or maybe those two together?
B	um
A	I could knit you a stripy jump suit
B	maybe
A	it's more expensive though knitting's quite cheap
B	well yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Buying a jump suit would be more expensive than knitting one.	Entailment
A	yeah I mean I think
B	try to like sculpt something like
A	well I was thinking like I've been keeping me eyes peeled for a um a palette you know like I was saying
A	Cos I wanted to build one of those palette gardens
B	uh oh right yeah of course yeah remember you saying yeah yeah you said uh you rest it on the wall and then yeah
A	you sort of cover the the back and the sides
B	yeah
A	and then
B	yeah
A	then it's useful
B	oh
A	I know he chucked ice
B	which one was he?
A	Gavin Henson? He's a Welsh rugby player he used to go out with Charlotte Church
B	oh no the Wales team but the that's the uh world championship team isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	Gavin Henson and Charlotte Church almost got married.	Neutral
A	he hasn't been playing in the
B	oh why was he not really in it and
A	he was in it um a while ago but
B	not not in the Five Nations then?
A	he wasn't in the Six Nations no
B	sorry the Six Nations
A	wasn't good enough
B	he's obviously a talented rugby player and it's unfortunate that well I've missed it
A	what?
B	that was a statement that they've issued
A	he's just a bit of an idiot like
[ANNOTATION]	The rugby player is a genius.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	The rugby player is a genious.	Contradiction
B	well he got drunk which is what rugby players are supposed to do
A	it was in the morning though
B	on a plane in the morning?
A	it was a plane from Glasgow
[ANNOTATION]	The plane from Glasgow had 300 seats.	Neutral
B	to?
A	Cardiff
B	still drinking in the morning he throws ice cubes
A	at a passenger or something
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Gavin Henson had a mature attitude.	Contradiction
A	and then he got
B	oh there he is on Strictly Come Dancing
A	yeah
B	twenty ten
A	he's been on another thing like something about bachelor like
B	there he is with Charlotte Church
A	something about a bachelor like um where girls were like winning the chance to like go on a date with him or something rubbish
A	and he's a bit weird
B	yeah maybe a bit  a bit  like yeah
A	I think he's a bit mad yeah
B	is that why Charlotte Church was going out with him then?
A	well I don't know
B	really?
A	yeah
B	still going out with him?
A	no
B	oh right
A	or at least she
B	I didn't know they had loads of babies
A	uh I dunno
B	no well probably for the best
A	so yeah
B	that's just a silly sketch
A	so um
B	uh
A	there's not there was
B	yeah there was loads of football wasn't there?
A	but I think it's because like we've been watching like um cups and stuff so it's getting towards the end so there's only like a few matches left
B	competitions really yeah
A	season yeah
B	uh yeah sort of yeah
A	so yeah I mean
A	so that's there's less
B	I think it's isn't Middlesbrough and Birmingham sort of going for uh and some others going for promotion meanwhile uh
A	well I think
B	meanwhile em Wolves are looking like they're definitely uh definitely down
A	aww
B	they are poor
A	they shouldn't have sacked Mick McCarthy though you know that's not gonna do them any favours is it?
B	uh is it it's the
A	yeah
B	they're talking about
A	sorry?
B	about Andy Warhol um things there
A	on the yeah
B	some of those
A	pop art?
B	yeah that those things
A	they're screen printed I think
B	so it's a photo that's been printed on
A	well I think
B	it's it's just it just looks like a black and white photo of um Marilyn Monroe and he's he's simply coloured in sort of on top of it
A	yeah screen screen printing you can do it I did it at college and you can do it where you um have
B	so what's the colour made out of?
A	it's like a ink
B	oh right
A	so you have like a  like a  template
B	not uh like a not a coloured um sheet of paper?
A	well you could do
B	that's an older older one is it?
A	I dunno
A	well I suppose it was pretty different at the time though I mean though like
B	I don't know
A	yeah
B	uh then there was also um what else did he do he sort of did like Campbell's Campbell's soup didn't he?
A	yeah
B	that wasn't uh
A	Don't know
B	easy to do
A	yeah
B	um
A	like throwaway I suppose like
B	and uh yeah that doesn't sound very
A	very what?
B	complementary you know it doesn't sound
A	does it not? Don't know you'll have to
B	it sounds like a
A	I don't know that much about art I mean
B	disposable like like a tin of  like a tin of  soup
A	I said I don't know that much about art
B	you have you your qualifications um in
B	well that's no you've
A	interesting? You
B	really unusual
A	yeah that's not
B	you know cos you had uh
A	some niche career's advice
B	uh
A	yeah
B	and um um maths and like physics so that was like well
A	I obviously wasn't very decisive as an eighteen year-old
B	so
A	mm that was a mistake as well
B	and therefore
A	never mind
B	but uh
A	yeah for someone else to do not to do yourself
B	if you have those qualifications then like you said you the thing that you'd be perfect for would be like an optical uh engineer or something an optical uh like a fence maker or something
A	I know
B	uh was that what the the what they you you could've been a fence maker?
A	na that was at
B	uh oh
A	it had a funny name?
B	no I um
A	you had to answer loads like hundreds of questions about yourself
B	they they would just be insulting like
A	and then at the end it was like Your career should be dee duh duh duh duh dee dee
B	yeah that was probably still in its  in its  like beta stage that was where it was
A	on balance
B	uh Fantastic Job Solutions
A	I've left that a bit baggy haven't I?
B	can't guess
A	mm

A	plasticination or something
B	I wouldn't have remembered that word actually but
B	and um he's gonna get his bodies and he's only gonna go and stick them up on you know take all the skin off and everything and stick them up on a load of crosses so we can all see how unpleasant crucifixion actually is
A	ugh
B	oh yeah no no no the I never objected to to any of it really I mean

B	Great great
A	but I think
B	no I don't mind it at all
A	it's just like what it really looks like underneath

A	yeah
B	like interesting thing to do but um
A	I dunno

A	like whether it was possible and
B	possible? Oh you mean how if he was really? Yeah
A	I
B	oh yeah cos uh it rips through yeah
A	but they would put it through your wrists and through your ankle bones

A	yeah
B	so
A	but definitely in the book he shows him his hands doesn't he the stigmata? In the book
