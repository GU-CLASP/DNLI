[ANNOTATION]	the voting system is considered to be changed	Entailment
A	and we lost Wogan so we shan't have him
D	mm no
B	mm no he hadn't presented it for a few years anyway though
B	it's Graham Norton now
[ANNOTATION]	the Eurovision presenter will be different next year	Neutral

B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	the presenter should be humorous	Entailment
A	mm mm
D	he made it though really
B	yeah it's it's the way to make it appeal to the British public really
D	cos I think nobody really watched the Eurovision Song Contest until Terry Wogan got involved
B	really?
D	yeah I think extremely low viewing figures but it's true Wogan's made it
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	terry wogan presented eurovison before	Entailment
D	mm exactly what it is really
B	the song Olympics
D	only it's a meritocracy
B	only it's not a meritocracy no there isn't an independent judging panel and timers
D	it's not about it's never been about the song it's all
B	I guess so although I feel like they pick their favourite song from their political affiliates
D	yeah
B	so still like the best of that bunch
D	mm
B	but we might as well not be in the competition
D	I can't remember I only remember Verda Serduchka
