B	what was it?
A	some sort of
C	a Jeep?
A	I don't know what it was

C	a Jeep on wheels
A	right cos Jeeps don't have wheels normally?
A	I think they do
B	I believe in the Loch Ness
A	well the thing is I just think it's a bit sad to be analysing it like that
B	yeah
A	cos the story has been there for a long time it's sort of a mythical thing isn't it? so it's a bit boring for everyone to go oh no we haven't found it because maybe there was a monster and maybe he went away or maybe he died
B	or maybe to protect them
A	yeah
C	what?
C	if it was on the
C	and T Rex would go
C	or even better hotdog shop with a big hotdog on top

A	I can't hear what you're saying
A	can you can you speak up please?
A	what are you saying?
A	mm
C	erm from other dinosaurs that wanted to stop on them
A	well not dinosaurs
A	cos this is when people were around
C	and then
C	the T Rex would go to a hotdog shop
C	and see a giant
A	I'm just trying to see if I can find a a news article about it I don't think I can
C	and then
B	about what?
C	he would
A	about the Loch Ness
C	try to pick it up pick it up drop it and go no erm there's a
A	thank you
A	I I can't hear what you're saying thank you
C	so I
A	no no just can you just speak please? can you just speak nicely? thank you so it's found the monster remains in Loch Ness that's the only thing it's found is this one from when it was filming
B	is there a picture of it?
A	there is a picture of erm
C	a Loch Ness?
A	the film
B	okay
A	I think erm or there was when I looked before
C	did the Loch Ness monster walk on land?
