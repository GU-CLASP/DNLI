A	yes
C	and this is the erm
A	timing wise
A	yes
C	they've just done this summer
A	yes
C	so
A	just hang on
C	er you can do but they haven't put these ones up yet so only teachers with a special login can get access to them access to them so it's
A	okay yeah yeah yeah I understand yes
C	we can't go find out the answers
A	hey now that's hard
C	it's not easy
A	that's really hard
C	well in the real thing it'll be an hour
C	in biology and each
A	are you telling me that you have
C	not yet no we've still got another
A	and what does unit three mean?
C	unit three is cells organs and populations enzymes and genetics
A	I don't know
C	that's like population so like a population of daisies or a population of animals and
A	no
C	no that's geography
A	oh
C	unit three is life processes and humans and their environment
A	is that where?
C	er no that's geography again it's more like erm
A	right yes
C	so it's quite current anyway yeah
A	mm mm
C	things I've already done unit unit one is human biology environment and evolution
A	do you select? do you look at past papers? and see what's come up? and try to go
C	yeah
A	your granddad used to do that all the time
C	yeah a lot of the time the questions
A	okay
C	well they're trying to make it more essay based so people can't say that oh it's science it's all memory do you know what I mean? they're trying to make it more
A	well that used to be the gap between O levels and A levels
C	yeah
A	my time were erm memory based
C	yeah
A	and then you got a shock when you're expected to think
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah uhu
C	that's in
A	right is
C	yeah?
A	erm it looks inviting
C	it does yeah
A	compared to what we had
C	it has to be really cos you spend so much
A	yes I've seen I've seen them
C	yeah
C	yes they do all subjects all exam boards
A	yeah
C	CGP
A	our own exam
C	yeah because this is the AQA edition
A	so you're lucky
C	yeah
A	but will that
C	AQA
A	is that your exam board?
C	yeah Assessment and Qualifications Association
A	okay
C	er you can get one of those and it shows and it points out which bits are but the third for if you're in a rush and you're trying to find out and you're looking for that it's a lot easier if
A	I would think it would I would prefer that
C	yeah
A	because sometimes
C	yeah
A	and you might get a sudden fright think I haven't done it
C	mm
A	oh no
C	yeah and then Thursday and Friday's physics and chemistry yeah
A	chemistry and physics?
C	no it's in the lesson no
A	but will you?
C	well this these are just sort of like
A	ah yes
C	for these
A	yes
C	but still you don't get it then
A	yeah ah
C	type
A	so you're
C	yes
A	quite comfortable with them?
C	yeah I mean there's not a huge amount riding on them
A	yes
C	instead
A	yes
C	yeah so if if you do drop down all you do is you
A	ah right I got it yes
C	you yeah you do core science which is
C	the unit ones
A	mm
B	did you say you had a
A	and it's just one paper for unit ones or it might be three papers I dunno and then you do additional science which is the unit twos
A	so you three unit twos
C	you don't do the
A	right
C	it will yeah
D	so have you worked out biology then
A	well actually it's not biology it's and I haven't even got to grips with
D	what the study methodology and everything
A	how those books work
A	and
D	oh
C	that's right
D	exciting innit?
C	but then
A	yes but you've a long time to know
A	ah you'll be okay
C	yeah yeah it's nothing really
A	yeah
C	erm
A	yeah
C	was the unit ones they did that last summer
A	yes
C	erm they've got the results some of them are resitting that some of them are not
A	yeah yeah
C	is worth twenty-five
A	just a minute I'm getting mixed up here
C	yeah
A	for your
C	er yeah let's stick with biology actually
A	which is
C	that's right unit one unit two unit three each one lasts an hour
A	you're doing each thing got it got it yes
C	that however twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five doesn't take a mathematician to work out that that's only seventy-five and not a hundred
A	so
C	so where does
C	where it does another twenty?
A	from
C	no
A	projects?
C	controlled assessment ISA and we actually did that last week and that is where you do an
A	did they tell you what you could do?
C	drawing conclusions and
A	yeah yeah
C	and the first paper is where you plan an experiment and then they tell you what experiment to do
A	well what's the point of getting you to erm plan an experiment experiment and then giving you one?
C	to show
A	ah
C	to examine the
A	do you still do it? your sort of preparation
C	yeah yeah
A	yeah
C	sort of yeah but it's it's more question based so it'll say erm
A	mm
C	just outline your method
A	like you light the Bunsen burner and
A	you put the
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	you erm
A	oh
C	you do
A	to see how
C	yeah to see
A	how your muscles
C	yeah and how
A	right how many can you do?
C	we haven't done it cos they give us a separate experiment to do cos that turned out it wasn't
A	it wasn't all that good
C	the one that
D	have you eaten
A	oh no thank you
D	are you sure?
A	yes I'm absolutely sure
C	yeah
A	it really is it sounds as though
C	oh well we do eleven subjects and I'm sure that you could
A	yeah
A	well actually I would I like learning
C	yes well this is the
A	yeah that's
C	yeah
A	that's your
C	yeah
D	no
C	but the what gives
A	yeah but don't panic about it
C	oh I'm not I wouldn't panic about it no no not all but
A	but you
C	yeah
A	made plans
C	yeah
A	and this question and this
C	really?
A	I mean it was risky
C	yeah
A	yes
C	that's very methodical
A	it was
C	I
A	well
C	yeah
A	it's later on that that comes into play
C	yeah
A	but
C	here is
A	yes
C	this is what the pages look like obviously I've written in here
A	yes
C	you get A4 it says do not write outside the box and that is because
A	okay
C	they scan it into the computer for the examiner
A	yes
A	it looks very
C	diagram
A	a lot of stuff to read
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	my answers
A	I can't haven't got my glasses on I can't see from here but
C	yeah
A	mm
C	yeah
A	did you?
C	er
A	what was it trig or?
C	it was it was about circle theorems where you say that these things are equal in a circle or angles in a circle things
A	oh yeah yes?
C	and he said that
A	well
A	to do all the calculatings all the adding ups in your head
C	oh
A	so
C	yeah that's how you'll've recognised that it was a picture of a circle
A	yes
C	that's like all hand drawn and all hand labelled
A	yes
C	and
A	and was it a triangle inside the circle?
C	it was yeah it was a
A	was it an isosceles?
C	er no it was a scalene triangle actually
A	a scalene?
C	yeah
A	wow
C	it looked like erm
A	and what what was your question?
C	it was like that and then it
A	mm
C	just had an angle labelled calculate this angle
A	yeah but he'd have to give you more than that
C	oh yeah
A	yeah it was after you couldn't do it
C	yeah
A	yeah yeah
C	mm
A	it was one of those things
C	mm
A	but I
C	well
A	do you get do you get them to bring home or not I know you can
C	er the maths department no you don't get your paper naturally cos they're all sent off but the maths department
A	yes
C	you need to go on the AQA website click GCSE or A level maths and things like that
A	now now that's another thing
C	or RMS or whatever yeah
A	okay if
C	who's who's been saying that?
A	well apparently it was on the news and somebody that I know sent me an email
C	what what context? what context was?
A	because they're getting a lot of stuff together for the refugees
C	oh no I didn't hear about that
A	well I just want to know what a city of
C	no I don't know that kinda stuff that
A	you know? is it historical? when did it come about?
C	haven't come across that before
A	well my cynical answer was well it didn't do a lot for the Jews did it? so I don't know how long it goes back
C	don't know
A	it might be a new thing I don't know
C	mm
A	yes but I can't erm
C	oh no no it's on the internet for anyone to see now
A	oh yes
C	you spend a long time running around the website you'll soon come across where it says
A	well I would do the maths
C	well do it
A	Oxford
C	yeah
A	mm
C	so it's anyone can look at it really
A	oh
C	it's open for anybody
B	I've printed you off an halo
