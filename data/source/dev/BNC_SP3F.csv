A	let me have a look Stalingrad Battle of Stalingrad
B	sorry
A	Volgograd
A	and Leningrad is now called St Petersburg I think it's that it used to be called St Petersburg and then it got named Leningrad and then they then they reverted to St Petersburg
C	where is St Petersburg?
A	I dunno I don't think it's very far from Moscow

B	that's
A	each one
B	is five
A	each centimetre is five million
B	centimetres
A	and what does that relate to? five million
B	that's the actual size of the scale so you can just
A	and what is five million centimetres?
B	er that that's actually working out how big the map is that's not the scale behind the
A	well yeah because then then you know if this distance here is ten things
B	yeah but it doesn't tell us the unit so it doesn't matter
A	it also says
B	well er
