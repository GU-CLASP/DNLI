A	erm
B	oh
A	yeah cos I've never been one
B	I mean if you can if you feel able to
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A is completely relaxed about Tuesdays.	Contradiction
A	mm
B	I think
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B knows that speaker A is anxious about Tuesdays.	Entailment
B	after the half term
A	mm
B	and obviously it it doesn't work out
A	mm
B	what if I had
A	yeah exactly
B	and I know it's really really hard to actually
A	it feels like an insurmountable problem
A	but it's fine
B	no I think you'll be able to do it
A	mm
B	so I'd focus on that
A	mm
B	maybe the next step doing independent work
B	no but when when
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A might start doing independent work.	Neutral
B	if you go back to your other work if you you probably work really hard at English like you
A	mm
B	and maybe
A	think I did
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has given some advice.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	but it's just
B	and
B	if if I thought that you you should go home I would've told you
A	do you do you
B	of course I would've done cos I've been in this situation
A	would you?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has not been in a similar situation.	Contradiction
B	and I remember when people
A	yeah
B	not for them
A	but I just I do feel like that I feel like it may be
B	the
A	not
B	mm
A	oh
B	the goal
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't feel like something	Contradiction
A	what I wanted to do
B	yeah
A	well no it kind of was the goal because that's just what you expect
B	mm
A	that's it's
B	mm
A	after school and college
B	yeah
A	but I never ever
[ANNOTATION]	It wasn't what speaker A would expect	Contradiction
B	particularly wanted
A	all the years
B	I mean yeah for me as well
A	mm
B	yeah people students that had done
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Students that had done a master's before	Neutral
B	university
A	but I did enjoy school but it's completely different
A	it's not
B	it's not school here
A	it's not the same in the slightest and
B	mm
A	because we had teachers
B	to do
A	and I liked that because there was some sort of
B	mm
B	you're just not sure what you have to do
A	you know it's
B	mm
A	sitting around so much
[ANNOTATION]	School is very different from university	Entailment
B	in what in what way do they say you're different?
A	like you know I've never
B	mm
A	I dunno yeah
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A doesn't know much about economics	Neutral
A	like how much someone can sort of change
B	I think
A	yeah
B	but at the same time

B	like
B	but like
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B thinks that university is necessary	Neutral
A	I mean I was depressed
B	yeah
A	I wasn't
B	yeah
A	any well I was different to how I am now but
B	okay
A	I just did the work for the exams but I didn't do enough
B	mm
A	even though I was still kind of
B	you just yeah
A	I've become like really anxious
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A was happy	Contradiction
B	yeah
A	this sort of
B	mm
A	anxiety and it's just like an irrational thing that's happened because of
B	I think
A	yeah
B	because you kind of
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A will be depressed again	Neutral
A	yeah
B	right
A	but like I had like no idea how bad it would be when I got home like I just it was
B	same same I thought things would improve when I got home and they didn't
A	yeah I know
B	it's returning to that
B	but yeah
A	and my family would
B	eat you alive?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A's family may eat Speaker A alive	Entailment
A	they would just be yeah
B	mm
A	I don't want them to be like that and it's just
B	I read something
A	mm
B	it was like an article that some like an
A	mm
B	why not?
A	mm
B	and they wish they hadn't worried because it's not
[ANNOTATION]	they were concerned about something	Neutral
A	oh but it's the money that's what makes it different
B	in that time
A	it's the fact that it's not compulsory it's about the
B	yeah
B	don't see it as money though
A	I know just oh
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the problem has to do with finance	Entailment
B	if you stay in
A	yeah it's fine and everyone
B	I know they do make your life difficult
A	they do
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	the financial problem was solved	Neutral
A	I don't they would try and convince me because by the way the way it sounds
B	I mean don't
A	I mean I'd only say that if I felt like it was better at home like
B	you don't think it is?
B	you just don't wanna be here?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	don't wanna be anywhere to be honest if that's
B	yeah
B	no I get you
B	mm
A	you know fight for it
B	mm
A	I just don't care
B	do you just feel very distanced for everything yeah?
A	yeah
B	and I think because you've you've not been temping as well I think it's difficult to want to stay because you don't feel a part of the uni
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	I just feel like I'm kind of living in this house and that's it
B	mm
B	maybe this week you could see as
B	I'm very grateful for you chum
B	a shit situation
B	because you are
A	mm
B	like
A	I dunno what to do I I dunno whether to start taking
B	mm
A	I've like I missed it
B	mm
B	you could start doing that
A	yeah I know like that's the problem really I don't really know whether
B	I mean when was the last time you were on fluoxetine?
A	mm
B	okay
A	I dunno I just
B	mm
A	I know it's not gonna work
B	you could try I mean potentially like
A	placebo
B	and you might feel different
A	yeah
B	you never know
A	I dunno but I wouldn't be able to get a
B	oh god that's
A	cos I mean it was prescribed to me but it was like at the beginning of the year and
B	give you it?
B	mm
A	probably I don't really know how it works but
B	twenty-two so almost a month's supply
A	yeah
B	the doctors here aren't very quick are they? and
A	no
B	at least not without medical
A	I mean cos I know I was saying that I stopped taking them because they weren't
B	but you didn't give it enough time yeah
A	it was in the first couple of weeks and I was feeling suicidal during the day when I was on my own and I didn't feel like particularly
B	mm
A	to be doing that
B	mm
A	cos my mum like was at work so there was no way for her to you know?
B	you could try again
A	dunno
B	combat the?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	cos they did say to me
B	is this at the medical practice down there?
A	mm
B	I mean you can book an appointment and it can
A	yeah see that's just
B	it is
A	yeah that's what I that's what I did the first time that was what
B	mm
A	but then I had to go through like two different people to
B	get the medication?
A	get an appointment
A	I
B	no don't talk about me I'm fine
B	had a bit of a er
A	mm
B	for no particular reason just I don't know
A	tut tut
B	yeah
A	might've done cos it it makes more of a difference the longer you're on it doesn't it?
B	mm
A	are you feeling shit?
B	not
A	mm
B	I think cos I I went out for a walk before
A	yeah
B	which is making me like
A	yeah
B	but I think hopefully once this week gets going
A	no they're shit here
B	mm
A	yeah weekends don't really mean anything to me anyway cos that last one didn't happen
B	no exactly
A	it was just
B	mm
A	and I dunno what's going on on campus and
A	really
B	it feels quite far away
A	yeah it does
B	it'll be better I think when the flat's full again
A	mm
B	no particular reason just cos
A	mm
B	you feel cos it it does get very quiet in this flat when there's not many people here
A	it really does
B	erm I don't think so
A	she probably won't be yet
B	she'll be back probably like
B	yeah
B	later on
A	yeah
B	I think
A	we need a lounge
B	yeah we do
A	that would make weekends so much better
B	just to have a lounge area and a TV
A	just watch films all day
B	Netflix and chill
A	yeah
B	I had no idea about the
A	didn't you?

B	I would totally read them again I gave all mine to charity
A	oh no
B	because I was like oh
A	yeah
B	so you you don't wanna admit that you're too old for them but to be honest though it's quite depressing that she's had more romantic life than me and she's fourteen
A	I know when I yeah when I read it I was like oh my god you're like
B	she's like I'm so attractive but I'm choosing between
A	when she's fourteen you know?
B	four guys or three guys or whatever it is I'm like
A	it's ridiculous

A	seriously?
B	like they say
A	no
B	I I told them I was gonna see Inside Out with my friends and they were like
A	huh
A	that film is more psychologically
B	it's like you watch it and see
A	and just
B	yeah
A	because I mean
B	exactly
A	the point of the target
A	like so you don't have to sit there with your kid like
B	exactly
A	so yeah I think
B	it's an excellent
A	it is
B	I've not seen Cars
A	apart from Cars yeah it's a pile of shit
B	oh is it? okay
A	yeah
B	I just saw it was about cars and I went nope
A	no
B	no
A	oh my god I watched that the other day

B	what does she sing in the song? she sings
A	oh
B	yeah
A	I get it
B	I've
A	what bit was that?

B	and she's
A	that's like
A	we have to watch that before we
A	oh no why are they making another one?
B	yeah I know what
A	oh I just hate
B	it's like
A	just just let it go
B	let it go
A	just let it go
B	let it go let it go it's the
A	oh I know I hate it
B	like they're even doing a Fifty Shades Of Grey sequel
A	oh my god are they actually doing that?
B	yeah
A	oh no
B	yep
A	oh that was it wasn't it?
B	mm
A	they're making a film of that?
B	the
A	oh
B	I
A	erm
B	oh right?
A	erm
B	it is a horrible franchise
A	it really is
B	yeah
A	but
B	were they like the first people to do that part one part two?
A	yeah
B	because of the book yeah
A	I mean that made sense though I
B	because of the book yeah
A	yeah
B	oh really? yeah
A	yeah like part one I thought was better than part two
B	mm
A	cos part two was just really over the top and they spent too long on the Voldemort thing and it was all just really
B	mm
A	and the first part was nice and
B	oh
A	but they just they just need to stop doing it for money it's just like the worst thing ever
B	cos it's really obvious isn't it like?
B	yeah
A	it's just they're not even being subtle about it any more like they used to say it was for like
B	yeah
A	it's awful
