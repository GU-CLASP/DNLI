B	no
C	quite a few times
[ANNOTATION]	Some words have been recorded, but not "gimp".	Entailment
B	yeah
C	erm of course it's hugely statistically skewed because the word corpus will appear hundreds of times
B	yeah
C	erm and you can have all sorts of fun because you know this will ultimately be transcribed
B	mm
C	so someone will have to listen to this
[ANNOTATION]	This is the second conversation they have recorded.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	I'm sorry for the person that has to listen to it
C	yeah
A	mm
C	but erm cool right erm food wise

C	which is sort of eight months before we moved in erm the next thing we saw on the local paper was erm yeah erm
B	mm

C	yes
B	living in the restaurants they're working in
C	yeah but
B	and like
C	they didn't have passports but erm
B	yeah sometimes they have passports although having them will you know
[ANNOTATION]	Some people live in the same place where they work.	Entailment
A	I I'm happy with pizza
B	yeah I'm happy with pizza too
C	I would just
B	yeah
C	there was also
C	an Indian which is pretty nice erm then there's a then there's cooking of course
A	mm hm
B	I'm happy with pizza

A	blimey
C	eh which is pretty good
A	that is
C	I think it's ten pounds if they deliver eh but they shouldn't
A	it's three pound of petrol to go there
C	well it's just like different somehow
A	well
B	yeah it sounds good to me
A	I am going for that

A	or sorry how much do you?
C	em delivery is free but it's more
A	mm
C	em interesting two medium pizza's does not feed four people you crazy crazy man erm

A	my mum used to cook pizza when I was young and it was horrible
B	you know the the two pizza bases we have

A	is it good?
B	I've never read it
A	the erm it's probably on business and eh
B	mm
A	eh I used to actually we used to get the
B	mm
A	and we used to have the when I was growing up we had the Express and Star every day
B	mm
A	the local paper
B	mm
A	for the eh the local
B	gossip
A	gossip
C	that's interesting
A	or we would just look for jobs in the summer from the erm community shop
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	just curious as to what jobs are out there
A	eight K
B	honestly it's not much better than that
A	yeah
B	the pay is unbelievably low
A	mm
B	erm
C	here's a question
B	I think how how can people afford to live on that kind of money
B	yeah like those  those poly poly-ethylene foams you know they're
A	yeah
B	that's like for a semi-skilled job
A	that's
B	and you're paying tax on it and you've got to buy a house and have a mortgage and get to work every day
C	you know
B	it's still
A	but still
C	you can buy a house in Sunderland for thirty grand
B	mm
C	Will get you a three bedroomed terraced house
B	this this is the thing
C	but still
A	even now?
C	yeah I mean but the house would be literally gutted you would need to completely redo it but
A	I I I've em
B	mm
A	a brand new not a brand new but only one person lived in it before
B	mm
A	A new build two bedroomed house for thirty-nine thousand
C	hang on you bought a house in two
A	the years have been kind
C	not bad
A	and then somebody sold it at the peak of the property market in two thousand and
C	mm hm
A	for a hundred eh and sixty-five thousand
C	you really should have kept that
A	my dad said to me whatever you do do not sell the house and I was like but I want ten thousand pounds now
B	oh
A	I do I used that money to do my masters
C	yeah
A	but I could have now had
B	yeah
A	a hundred and seventy thousand
B	so many people became rich
A	yeah
B	just from
A	just to
B	property from no
A	even now you can get
B	even now I think it's an okay place like it's
A	that surely
B	it's not not like this
A	yeah it's
B	and it's clean and it's not falling to pieces
C	yeah but it's
B	and it is some parts of
C	just going back to that for a second
A	yeah
C	how old are you?
A	thirty-three
C	so you're the same age as
A	yes
A	I cannot believe that
C	how is that possible?
B	I think
C	thirty
A	but he can't how long has Jan been at TTP?
C	twelve years
B	but I worked  I worked
A	if he's twelve years then if he
B	yes
A	so he was twenty-one
B	yeah
C	that's insane
A	but Jan is probably ten times fitter than me which is the eh
B	which is
A	bizarre
C	no
A	yeah
B	Jan Jan's the well the things I hear about Jan he's really good at playing squash
A	yeah he is
B	and tennis as well
A	and cricket and
B	and all that sort of stuff
A	yeah
B	but but yet he just doesn't look it's just the way he's like you know
A	mm
A	no he's a well he's county squash
B	yeah
A	squash players are normally whippets aren't they you know like
B	yeah
A	that sort of build but
C	I just yeah that's pretty weird
A	yeah
C	yeah I know he's got a cat
B	his cat's got HIV
A	really?
B	yeah his cat's got HIV or a cat version of it
A	how did he get that? Off another cat?
B	the cat was like just playing around
A	is that?
C	sleeping about
A	so can a human?
B	no and not unless I I and even if you tried I don't think you'd probably get it
A	no but a cat can
B	yeah I think it's I don't think it's yeah
A	yeah cos surely that will
C	I'm sure that is
A	it would be quite the news story if cats were walking around
B	yeah
C	actually that being said I'm sure The Daily Mail will run that
A	yeah
B	Cos he was looking up for a website one day at work about erm cat HIV and I started laughing
C	that's nothing
A	mm
C	but a friend of mine managed to so the first term at uni so we had a girl at our college who was a miserable cow erm but she looked even more miserable than all and it turned out her grandfather had bitten it early on had just died
A	mm
C	who she was pretty close to
A	yeah well it's quite easy to say that isn't it?
B	eh there's actually a friend of mine in school and we were sitting in the physics class and this mate of mine didn't get on with this other mate of mine
C	right
B	and erm they were just having a go at each other and I can't remember what it was exactly
C	jealousy clearly
A	hadn't picked up on it
B	yeah
C	that's a good way of winning an argument
B	he did apologise profusely after that he was
C	I was gonna say I bet he was going it well he was probably a bit young but he had a lot of drinks bought for him
B	mm? Yeah
C	yeah
C	ow
C	ow
B	that's the dungeon door
A	is he just not wearing the top he was
B	yeah he's slowly getting undressed
B	as we're talking to him
A	took his socks off before and took his
B	and now he took his top off
A	oh no
B	oh he's he's slipped into something more comfortable
A	I thought
C	what's that sorry?
C	pretty much a normal Friday night
C	em yeah so erm sorry what were we saying? What were you?
A	cat has got HIV
B	oh yeah
A	so is
B	I don't know if it's
C	yeah
B	I think he just has the one cat
A	I might meet her
A	mm
C	erm but yeah it's that's something that would be fascinating to go and actually see cos I think it would either a complete pit or really obsessively tidy
unknown_female	mm hm
A	I think you can judge them by how somebodies desk is ordered
B	by somebody's desk
A	you know like he lines everything up eh whereas if you go and look at them Abbey Graham's desk and I for people that have been to her house
B	if you can find her desk
A	her flat is the same as her desk
B	yeah
A	it's like
C	yeah then that kinda makes sense actually
B	I remember before she moved offices
C	yes
B	but it there was one point it was just sloping down to the to there
A	but it also you know
B	it was like it was actually like
A	she sits right next to
B	yeah
A	and
C	Matthews in the mafia
B	see my desk is somewhere in the middle
A	yeah
B	and so is my
A	I have a tidy up every erm so often
B	I have a tidy up every few weeks I tidy my desk
B	but I don't mind like I throw things like all over the floor sometimes
A	yeah
B	but it will be tidied up at some point
A	you should get it really messy just between the doors
B	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
C	mm
A	Gary being Gary
C	speaking of which how is
B	it's
A	I thought she might erm give you both barrels?
B	no
A	well she's made it pretty clear this week that
B	mm hm
A	cos she went out at four thirty yesterday
B	yeah
A	four weeks she's gotten
B	oh I like her though
A	no you
B	look at
B	he barely did anything for the last year
C	he was only there for two
A	I I I eh I I don't agree with that
B	he said lot
A	he just he didn't have that much to do
B	maybe
A	but he was conscientious till the end
B	yeah
A	but I thought
B	yeah eh Les was supposed to stay longer but even as soon as I came in there he was like he says he said I look like I left as soon as I could otherwise I was gonna say something because I thought you know
A	yeah
B	and
A	he well you
B	all that stuff
A	yeah
B	that's that's exactly why he had a very enormous argument with her was for the work she was doing
B	oh yeah
A	this morning saying
A	Cos
B	that's would have been  that would have been  been shameful if
A	yeah
B	that's what I was thinking
A	yeah
B	Cos I thought he would be away somewhere
A	yeah
C	mm
B	yeah
A	but erm
C	yeah I'm eh glad I missed that actually
A	mm
B	it could have been worse actually
A	yeah
B	but
A	and
B	mm
A	you know I don't know half those people that she knew
A	she she that turned up to
B	so if you left next week
A	just be erm
B	I think I'd just hire
A	probably just be yeah two or three people
B	you me and
A	I know slow hand clap
B	boo
C	but how long have you been at
A	three years
C	okay
A	yeah
B	there's a
A	so around the time I joined so just before me
C	no
A	so she joined six months before me
A	yeah so
C	mm
A	erm
C	who is that?
A	sits about three foot from you
C	oh yeah
A	yeah
C	no
A	didn't know
B	I can't believe
A	do you think
B	all the people that ever talk about don't say anything nice about him
C	really?
A	no
B	I don't think it's fair either I think because
A	well he yeah
B	erm who else? But
C	well presumably cos he had ideas of his own
A	yeah
B	but most people have no one anyone that's ever spoken to me about him is that
A	he has been
B	yeah
A	it's amazing how people get forgotten when they leave like completed throughout
C	you saw his tool box
B	saw his tool box yeah
B	but I'll I don't know
A	mm
B	maybe it's because the
A	that wasn't his fault
B	I don't think it was
A	that
B	no
A	would have gone wrong along time
B	and and also partly just used the situation at the time without any money
A	yeah
B	where it was all going wrong
C	oh he actually left because of that?
A	no
B	I think he probably
A	I think he was a not for since really I I've known him from MT days he was not overly you could say he was not overly happy
B	oh okay
A	and I think it was erm
B	so I feel like it did stress him out a lot
A	I bet it did
B	he's he's
A	a terrible job
B	yeah
A	just a thankless task basically
B	yeah
A	you know that's the one thing like
B	but the main thing the image of
A	yeah
B	absolutely no cash to do it with
A	and and the design was already set in stone
B	and as much as like
A	yeah
B	he'd tell me to I can't remember
A	yeah
B	but nonetheless
A	okay then you go and do it
B	you need to get it fixed
A	yeah
A	yeah
B	the situation he was in I know but I did you know you can't go against him and that you know
C	the erm what was I thinking? Erm how em that's much better formed in my head
B	do you know last month in the meeting erm remember we were talking about doing the K2 drop test? That eh
A	oh yeah
B	and David was like erm eh yeah of course as Gary was saying eh you know nothing actually works
A	Don't say that
B	you can't say that
A	it's like when Adrian piped up with the eh
C	oh yeah
A	don't yeah nobody touch the rig cos it will kill you
A	instantaneously it will kill you
B	yeah
C	to be fair
A	and then
B	you stupid
A	Don't announce that in the you know it's like
C	well to be fair but hmm
A	it would
C	yeah as in it wasn't going to be dangerous
A	yeah
C	so his goal was to frighten us into not touching it
A	yeah
C	but of course then there was this huge
A	yeah it's like
B	it gives the thing is
A	yeah but he can't not
B	yeah
A	he can't
B	but the that's part of it had been taken out
A	yeah
B	so he can can actually be primed to
A	is that has that been run yet or?
C	no we haven't got any money so
A	oh right
C	it's just sitting there currently
B	yeah
C	erm it wasn't it
B	and
A	yeah
B	erm she already has
A	and he
B	I was sitting there and watching what
A	yeah
B	I was like oh had to go and pick up her kid
A	I saw it
B	on the note of paper he just wrote where was
A	yeah
B	that was what was written
A	the first thing the next morning
B	first thing the next morning
A	he he he's like
A	yeah he went over to her and said ah so what's a matter with
B	mm
A	he
B	it's just
A	she came in at eight o'clock
B	yeah
A	you know
B	he's pathetic though
A	yeah
B	you know
C	mm
B	but he's such a
A	yeah
C	which is quite entertaining seeing as she's doing but in judgement of the quality fit
A	mm
B	do you remember when
A	really?
B	yeah
A	Cos then it reflects badly on him
B	probably
C	yes
B	he was like oh why on earth are you wanting to leave you've done a really good job? That's what he was saying to her
A	is that?
B	he wasn't
A	but you made me cry a couple of weeks ago
C	yeah I mean viewed either way that's like you don't have to like someone but that's appalling people management
B	mm
A	oh yeah
B	I remember there was one one day
C	and it's quite sorry not to interrupt but
A	it's alright
C	I was just interrupting
C	eh but that is quite a substantial and important part of his job
A	yeah
C	sorry you were saying?
B	eh so no the I remember one day erm
A	mm
B	and eh
A	yeah
B	something like that
A	he didn't?
B	I heard him say that
A	he did not
B	he said
A	I could I thought
B	he said that to her and then it was about half an hour later he ran after her and said I'm really sorry about that
A	he's
B	that is the only time I've seen him
A	yeah
B	have a go at
A	yeah
B	but he's almost
A	I'm surprised that
B	yeah you should make an official complaint about it if you think I'm having a go at my staff and then erm he was with her half an hour an hour later he's like I'm really sorry about that
C	eh two questions
B	right well
A	I think it's been done three or four times in the last six months
B	well you'd think
A	yeah
C	in general or specifically?
C	he
B	this is why
C	Cos you sit next to him that's quite
B	erm it's a bit we we used to sit even closer than that
A	he's like
B	he used to sit where Steven is then
A	yeah
C	eh huh
B	and we never spoke to each other
A	until he moved himself to eh eh his own desk which people very amusingly the other group like people walk through the office like the other group leaders like Jamie
C	mm
A	needs separate himself from the minions
C	the erm another question erm so why why this erm immunity on
A	just because she she couldn't say anything you know?
B	yeah
A	Cos she said lots of things that nobody else could get away with saying
B	you can't you can never annoy the secretary can you?
A	yeah
B	she is
A	and you know she'll just she's yeah you don't want to piss her off
B	mm
A	there's nothing  there's nothing  that you could gain by annoying
B	yeah exactly she's a
A	apart from
C	do be fair there's nothing you can gain by annoying anyone?
A	no
C	mm hmm
A	sort of got a bit of a holdover like because someone said you know because he can  he can  make your life
C	mm
A	you know
C	but he
B	but the thing is
A	what would he do to get
C	because people would just leave
B	the thing is
A	yeah exactly
C	yeah everyone is pretty employable
B	if he wants he can have a go at me
A	yeah
B	and he can say oh that's not right why are you turning up late and all this  all this  sort of stuff
A	mm
B	and I can't do anything back
A	yeah
B	whereas if he annoys
A	yeah
B	on a one to one basis from
A	he needs a good relationship with
B	yeah
A	he well you know
B	but the erm the the
C	the thing is I I
B	the delay between pissing off one of us and getting some retribution is a year or something
C	mm
B	between
C	and you just
A	he doesn't think before he
B	yeah
A	like he
C	you see the thing is I don't
A	yeah
B	see I used to think that he is probably a bad person
B	I know everyone says that he's probably a nice guy but he's just got bad people skills
A	he's
B	not massively unpleasant but just not that nice you know
A	he's insecure
C	yes
A	very
C	which has been eh one I had one or two problems with
A	yeah
C	when he's taking stuff up so very defensively
A	yeah he's
C	mm
A	yeah even when he's yeah
C	yeah so what is the history of our team?
A	so when I started it was
[ANNOTATION]	He is very confident and kind.	Contradiction
C	right
A	which was
C	okay
A	and
C	what
A	yeah
C	okay
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker C is in a team.	Entailment
A	eh
C	mm hm
A	you know like they he's like groomed
C	okay
A	erm so that's anyway so and then after a year erm of me being there it split into S T didn't exist before that really
C	sorry can you just go through that again? So it was originally MT
A	yeah originally M T
C	right
[ANNOTATION]	The group meets twice a month.	Neutral
A	and half the people from M D
C	right
A	M T
C	A S must have been huge
A	yes it was it was very big
C	so so M D is how old?
A	erm a year and eh two
C	okay
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	All these groups competed against each other for the best brewed beer.	Neutral
C	A S has been sorry S T then formed and so Matthew went off to lead that
A	yeah
C	and so
A	yes
C	which M D formed a per cent of
[ANNOTATION]	Matthew was the leader.	Entailment
A	erm yeah you know he was just being insecure but
C	mm hm
A	yeah just
B	which he freely admits actually
A	yeah
B	mm hm
A	erm
C	but it's an interesting cos I always thought being insecure you you would want people to like you
[ANNOTATION]	He knows he is insecure.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	well
A	and it's got a bit of a temper as well
A	as well
C	mm
A	yeah so he joined when he graduated from
C	yeah
A	but he'd been there on erm eh summer placement like the year before or two years before
C	yeah
A	senior sort of thing and they used to have a right laugh
C	mm
A	the thing with
C	mm
B	yeah
A	and
B	mm
A	you can't you know
B	mm
A	and it completely changed their relationship you know eh basically he said don't ever don't
C	yeah that's interesting
A	Cos eh yeah
C	yeah
A	so that's a potted history of my time at TTP
C	oh I've learned an awful lot in the last half hour
C	that it was sort of eh that's the pizza and that's our doorbell not working again
A	I need to go and erm make room for dinner
B	and eh
C	see the interesting thing with erm
B	mm hm
C	which I think he attaches more of an importance to
B	what sorry?
C	as in
B	oh
C	erm and I think that's sort of
B	sorry what's what's
C	eh his PHD eh from
B	okay
C	and I think undergrad as well
B	aye
C	erm and I think he's probably got a bit of sort of I don't know
B	mm
C	and therefore massively like has that value distorted out of all proportion
B	mm
C	erm whereas you see
B	yeah
C	although to be fair the at the end of the day
B	mm
C	but the erm
B	eh I'll yes I might actually have a beer actually seeing as we're having pizza
A	I did yeah
C	erm drink?
A	erm some lemonade please
C	are you sure you don't want to try some of this?
A	what is it?
C	eh it's sort of non-alcoholic wine or at least something in between non-alcoholic wine and fruit juice
A	eh yeah go on then but don't open it if it's eh
C	no
A	oh right
C	so he literally can't have anything that usually says trace amounts
A	yeah
C	erm so we stocked up
A	can he wear aftershave? Or erm
C	probably not
A	yeah I didn't do that
B	yeah it doesn't hugely surprise me
C	erm oh dear
A	what do you rub your feet with?
C	eh cos eh if you look at the bottom if you look at the floor here there's some marks
B	oh yes
C	it's because the screws are poking out at the bottom of the bench
A	oh
C	Cos they they are covered in rubber but rubber compresses
