A	the guy was really sort of trendy
B	yeah like uh just uh in

[ANNOTATION]	person B know that is one of them	Entailment

A	oh
B	is it  is it?
A	I saw in the news
B	I don't know if it's
A	I saw in the news something like coming to a town near coming to
B	yeah sorry
A	that was in the news
B	what they released like a trailer for themselves did they?
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
B	they didn't but did they release it or or did someone just sort of you know do it on their Apple and then uh
A	I don't know
B	put like by Al Qaida on it or something
A	I've had a bit more than
B	oh right no actually that's it's great it's nice
A	mm
B	so you you preferred your previous hairdresser then
A	oh yeah sorry
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about hairdresser	Entailment
A	this guy was sort of like he was he's totally camp but he was more like he was just easier to get on with and he did my hair nice a few times
A	you know
B	get to know a little
A	its intricacies and flatness
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about intricacies	Neutral
A	I don't mind if he camps my hair up
B	um
A	I'm not sure I'm wild about that idea
B	um it's sort of interesting
A	I think I'll just get it trimmed and like
B	like Julia Roberts in uh?
A	sorry? The colour of?
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about colour	Entailment
B	she had  she had  a perm didn't she?
A	did she?
B	didn't she have one in um Pretty Woman or something?
A	I'm not party to Julia Roberts's hair treatments
B	well there was a lot of them in the eighties anyway I dunno if it was um
A	yeah
A	like
B	well
A	I could go in and imagine if I went the hairdressers and just took a picture of Kevin Keegan and was like Can I have this please?
B	oh yeah it used to go all round
A	aha and like they're quite long though as well like
B	yeah
A	your hair gets a bit like that sometimes
B	mm well
A	I know
B	well
A	no you don't need to get it cut it's nice
B	I'll have it shaved shaved off
A	I'm not sure that's that would be very nice but
B	might do
A	well might do
B	which uh
A	you could have a crew cut
B	you? Well um
A	just have to rub a flannel on me head and that'll be done
B	not not sure if uh
B	if if
A	I think it would be beautiful that lovely forehead and uh the bit lumpy bit at the back of my head
B	so would you will you change the colour of it then
A	well I've got uh
B	yeah
A	sometimes dying your hair like it gives it a bit of like makes it nice to nice conditioning
B	maybe gives it a nice texture?
B	yeah so I might do and it's also a little bit more a little bit
B	yeah
A	on my already quite gingery hair
B	is there already? Whose whose is your favourite celebrity hair?
A	who's my favourite celebrity hair?
B	yeah
A	which Greek ones?
B	mm like most most of them you know the the big big Greek hair
A	um Kate Middleton's got nice hair hasn't she? She always has it done nice
B	uh
A	I do like um Cheryl Cole when she has it really massive
B	what's it like?
A	Kate Middleton hair
B	and curled at the end? Yeah
A	she definitely has it done yeah
B	oh right
A	but she's got sort of straightish hair but
B	yeah I guess um someone um
A	um and also who else's hair? I don't know
A	well
B	yeah
A	like snap it all or anything but
B	yeah
A	like my hair's not really any different
B	yeah
A	you know especially for work I just
B	yeah
A	so
B	right
A	am I boring you with my hair stories?
B	um well no I was asking um
A	so um yeah so I'm quite lucky cos some people  some people  just can't like me friend Lucy she's got lovely hair and if I was her I'd just leave it but she like full-on straightens it and that every single day
B	Cos you  cos you
A	which is crackers if you ask me
B	um
A	but each to their
B	yeah I think a lot of people uh
A	curl? Yeah
B	but some people uh if you straighten the hair it would grow like in a  in a  mushroom shape
A	yeah that'd be good
B	um like um
A	maybe I should straighten yours one time
B	I think mine
A	in fact I don't even know if I've got any straighteners any more
B	I think mine mine might go in a mushroom shape um but uh
A	oh it'd be nice mushroom
B	I think it probably would actually
A	oh it's like some sort of survey
B	about the NHS
A	do you think it should be privatized?
B	um well it's not being properly uh
A	I knowing it's not being privatized as such by name but
B	but it's not the same as America's one and it's it's always gonna have that sort of centralized feel I
A	I don't
B	but it it I believe there's a problem in certain companies with certain private
A	mm
B	part of the problem with that is the sort of monopoly aspect of uh
A	yeah
B	or um it it's not quite a monopoly but it you know the thing with the
A	oh yeah
B	um like
A	oh it's horrible I hate all that thing
B	which so but of course there's there's no way that the customer can can choose uh different services there there's only that one private service possibly available from that bed and they can't go anywhere since they're they're stuck in the bed so they're that is a forced monopoly which is always um
A	feeding the
B	yeah the the sort of desperation to raise um money is is the problem that that hits that like if you  if you  make um
A	yeah
B	if you make uh
A	yeah
B	any any price that would possibly be able to go up would go up
A	yeah
B	um so yeah well I think I already talked about that but I mean if I I don't understand like what they were doing with the uh NHS now I don't  I don't  um
A	I think it was gonna be that they would let let doctors choose how they should spend the money
B	uh no I didn't
A	so Michael Gove the absolute
B	they're privatizing that as well? He's got a funny old face hasn't he? I think he's been been
A	but he's horrible isn't he? Oh he's just I just really dislike the man
B	uh no I've
A	yeah
B	why is he doing that to save money?
A	well
B	what's the advantage of it?
A	well he's saying he said he wants them to be more rigorous
B	whereas
A	of course I mean
B	I don't  I don't  know I don't see why they're changing it
A	oh
B	um
A	well who's in the Russell Group that's not that great? Warwick
B	no I you  I you  can't insult a whole university but you can say that there may be they're not
A	well
B	yeah I mean
A	basically
A	well that's my opinion
B	why but but how many uh but
A	well older older people think that A levels are easier now don't they? Oh I don't know
B	I I don't know I mean I don't know the whole of the
A	I think he's just putting problems onto like
B	ah I don't know that I wonder
A	but anyway maybe that's just
B	there's been
A	maybe that's not the case
B	yeah so the main story in the on this one seems to have been the introduction of something called uh um Big Society Capital I mean
A	what Cameron? No not really I mean I I've heard of his Big Society ideas
B	um
A	Cos the people who want who are gonna be inclined to do that are already doing that I bet
B	um
A	ooh sorry
B	it yeah well if you can force people but it doesn't always work does it because
A	sorry
B	uh because they would say that
A	ah thank you
B	yeah in fact so that didn't work that didn't sort of
A	thank you
B	that didn't work very well they they all pulled out of it
A	yeah
B	I dunno well the companies pulled out so um if the companies pulled out then somebody uh well the customers must've complained
A	yeah
B	someone scared
A	yeah
B	uh well it just appeared I mean
A	so we didn't
B	to to try and get people into into jobs but
A	yeah yeah
[ANNOTATION]	They are not trying to get people into jobs	Contradiction
B	I guess it depends on the state obviously but here the message is absolutely you know um austerity and cutting everything whereas in uh I think in America they they've they've decided to
A	yeah
B	they're not cutting  they're not cutting
A	to stimulate growth you mean? What's that called I'm sure it's got like a
B	uh well there's different things aren't there? you know
A	quantitative easing?
B	and then that's uh I think that just means printing money um
A	yeah
B	like
A	yeah
B	um that means the money gets to be printed
A	I find it
B	but it America though they're more sort of
A	yeah
B	um which is the world's biggest um and uh that seems to me to be a slightly different technique to what's going in over in Europe it's seems to be always um apart from maybe some of the more successful countries like Germany pretty much everyone's just um basically chopping the
A	yeah
B	it uh just just reducing um spending and and cutting um cutting government spending cutting funding for things um so just struggling to sort of define that
A	well I dunno I find it hard to follow like I suppose it's not
B	yeah I know well it it can be
A	yeah
B	from the number of buses to uh
A	oh no I can  I can  see why
B	and I I mean obviously uh you know fuel prices are a good example of uh
A	yeah the fuel crisis as well
B	well we just had  we just had  the panic didn't we so uh panic panic buying
A	I liked it that like other things were jumping on the band wagon and saying like oh panic buy beer and like
B	yeah
A	has there even been a strike like they
B	no no there
A	I'm sure they were just trying to get some extra revenue in before the end of the tax year
B	oh yeah something like that I mean they tried to get the guy to resign but he didn't um he didn't resign uh I think they were just trying to like sensationalize it and put the blame on um you know sort of uh attack the strikers hadn't actually started striking yet so um
A	hadn't struck?
B	they they they
A	yeah
B	which which worked in that way but but it also meant that there was massive like panic and and uh one person did die actually so there was one uh
A	oh was that the woman who was
B	I don't know but um someone someone there well there
A	which who d'you mean died? What of? What did she die of though it wasn't just sheer panic
B	uh being burnt by petrol I imagine
A	yeah that was the woman who'd I think who'd stockpiled the petrol and she was decanting it from one like jerry can into another while her oven was on
B	well it's above the oven or something?
A	no like I think she was just splashing it around while a gas flame was on in her
B	yeah
A	like she was cooking her dinner yeah yeah a gas hob like a
B	yeah yeah uh that's that's like
A	well I mean that's like Darwinism that is if you ask me
B	but if it weren't for the  if it weren't for  the panic then she she wouldn't have got burnt
A	D'you know what I mean? I feel
B	she wouldn't have been um she wouldn't have been decanting
A	I really do
B	well it I guess it is
A	bit of natural selection there I think
B	yeah but people just make mistakes man if they're  if they're  if they're in a hurry if if you're in a panic
A	well
B	then then you you you you may make a mistake like because cos they're not normally  they're not normally  doing that are they?
A	well if you're gonna get into
B	you don't normally handle fuel in the house do you so?
A	well
B	yeah but if you can  you can  pour it in the um living room can't you? Or can't you I mean
A	well you can
B	you're saying that even the  even the  vapour of it is gonna catch fire
A	well I wouldn't do it I mean I don't
B	you'd have to yeah decant it outside
A	oh uh yeah exactly
B	yeah so I don't know why she didn't decant it outside that's something that we don't  we don't  know
A	in your garage or something innit? Ah
B	um perhaps she didn't have an outside
A	well most people have an outside
A	well
B	um
A	A
B	that everyone's like
A	and now they're saying
B	well that's annoying
A	no no but like from today it's a if you get caught watering your garden it's a thousand pound fine
B	that's quite  that's quite  bizarre you know
A	ridiculous isn't it?
B	it's quite strange considering the amount the sheer enormous quantity of rain that falls in England
A	I know
B	why are they sort of doing all this  all this  stuff anyway about? It's raining now
A	I know it's raining now
B	are you supposed to collect your own water or something?
A	I think it hasn't been raining for a while though
B	um
A	well I don't know
B	yeah uh I suppose like that that's the most efficient that you know with the with um
A	I don't think plants like sea water that much
B	I guess
A	well
B	A
A	no I suppose it always does evaporate
B	yeah
A	so
B	but it's just is it's just not
A	put a lid on the reservoir?
B	to
A	I think it most definitely would be
B	depends what you lid it with though doesn't it?
A	could store it underground
B	yeah I mean presumably there's some reason why they
A	I dunno
B	I suppose there could  there could  be able a method of of trying to keep
A	but you're right it's rained all day today
B	Cos cos it's it seems that the volume is there you I mean
A	yeah
B	somehow anyway
A	but I bet they'll still water the grass at King's and all that
B	um
A	yeah
B	guess so yeah
A	yeah
A	squirting it around? Yeah I suppose it is but
A	look at your garden? Yeah
B	and then um
A	ah and like neighbours taking pictures of you? Like the uh Stasi?
B	get get a hose hose pipe and sort of spray
A	then you can
B	well that that's like one of those  one of those  stupid petty garden wars where
A	yeah yeah
B	where neighbours chop each others' trees down
A	that's right yeah
B	like border border
A	why do people do it? People've just got more money than sense haven't they?
B	well yeah basically I think that's that's mainly um but they're also just
A	yeah
B	well I mm
A	yeah right on your bit
B	like a a metre further in?
A	they did that to me nana like me nana used to um have
B	I think it's just bad people isn't it?
A	me nana had daffodils
B	person who's always got to
A	had all these tulips and daffodils a massive big load of them against against that fence in her old garden where we where she used to live
B	yeah I know yeah I remember you saying
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	so then they moved it though and like
B	how
A	the council moved the fence by about you know
B	but how? I mean that can't just happen can it or was there some corruption or something?
A	dunno just by mistake I think
B	so she
A	well I don't think you realize until the spring time came and all the flowers were on the
B	fuh
A	never mind
B	there um uh
A	yeah
B	uh
A	yeah
