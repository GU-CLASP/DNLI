A	no
B	that's the thing like it's not revealing it's literally just like what you'd wear to like

B	I will just be like hallelujah praise the lord for my clothes
A	I wish I'd brought my camera with me so I could've taken some like proper professional photos of you just like modelling the clothes and
B	and then he'd spend even more and he'd be all like
A	yeah exactly he'd be like woah you were so good at this
B	woo
A	like let's do it again
B	I told him that I was going to charge my pictures
A	I doubt that
B	I don't think he will
A	well he has paid for clothes
B	yeah that's I think that's a bit tight isn't it?
A	yeah little bit
B	a little bit but still you gotta
B	I'm never this mean to anyone I know I would never do this to anybody cos it's
B	it's just like I don't agree with it because it's sexist and horrible but
A	you're lucky I am non-
B	but I don't really care I just oh
B	I don't I don't actually care like I I
A	yeah it's money
B	it's my money it's me it was made for me you earned that for me
A	I mean they want to do it it's up to them
B	yeah
A	but I don't get this one I don't understand why he would want to
B	no neither will I
A	take photos of you in like Missguided clothes like it's not like it's a sexy photo
B	no it's not
A	it's just like you and his mates
B	he says he just I just like dresses and I said okay
B	well that's weird but I didn't say that's weird but it's like
A	mm
B	when he chooses the clothes see if they're really like sexual then I'll like sexual then I'll like delete him
B	if they're like disgusting
A	I thought he said you could choose them
B	yeah he said I could choose and he goes I'm going to log on to make a new account I'll log on to it and I'll choose some more to add to the basket if there's any that you
A	how is he gonna add it to the same basket that you've got?
B	because if they put it on your account he I've given him my login details
A	oh
B	for that
B	yeah because I changed it
B	like yeah and I've
A	no
B	through this which is good
B	if it works why the hell not?
A	it's just I can't believe you got so lucky with this like
B	yeah I know
A	I've found so many people who just wanna give me money and
B	cos I said I'd stop after the
B	but no but he wants to buy me clothes and how can I resist clothes? so many clothes needed
A	I deleted mine cos people were just asking me like why why would you
B	yeah yeah I deleted mine actually but then I reactivated it to
A	yeah I know that's the problem it's so easy to reactivate
B	yeah
A	and it's just kinda you get a bit curious like mm
B	I know it's really bad
A	yeah it's not good
B	he might not be able to get in cos I'm in it
A	yeah you won't be in it at the same time probably
B	erm log out bye bye log out
A	bye
B	have you logged in? have you tried? I'll text him
A	yeah it's good
B	I haven't
A	it's just a bit odd
B	it is a bit odd
B	okay
A	mm
B	that's so but the thing is I'm doing everything that I disagree with
A	yeah
B	because and I don't agree with that at all like it makes my blood boil
A	no
B	but
A	if you're getting money out of it then why not?
B	yeah
A	it's
B	I just
A	mm
B	ow
A	you probably bruised it
B	yeah I think so
B	you know
A	still do it it's only underwear
B	yeah but I don't like wearing
A	yeah but it's money isn't it?
B	it is
A	although no it's not money it's just him buying you underwear
B	oh can I get a Christmas jumper? can I ask him? can I have a Christmas jumper thrown in?
A	probably not he just he wants like dresses
B	tinsel tits yes
A	ugh
B	er
B	okay
A	I hate all of them
B	me too
A	they're all horrible
B	all I want for Christmas is
A	no
B	mince pies before guys
A	er
B	oh my god jingle my bells why are they all?
A	they're so
B	they're horrible those er
A	mm
B	and I don't want to have to buy an outfit really so you know if he wants to buy me dresses dresses he will buy me by the way if you want anything this is your chance
A	seriously?
B	yeah yeah jump in
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
A	don't think I want a dress though I
B	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	go on have a look
B	have a look
A	it's not really
B	I mean I don't know if he'll buy it on this one but you know if this turns out to be a regular thing
A	well you haven't got two hundred pounds have you?
B	no I haven't
[ANNOTATION]	Person B said he have not got that much money	Entailment
A	why is it not working? I hate this laptop
B	you hate Macs
A	I really hate Macs they're not they're not Windows
B	yes they are you get used to it
A	break me out I don't like it
B	you know go down like that
A	yeah but I need to look at all of them and I
B	you want a like a?
A	oh why is it not working?
B	you have to double click it
A	oh
A	no but it needs to be more than that filter like
A	my god this is so frustrating
[ANNOTATION]	Person a think that filtering is so frustrating	Entailment
B	he said give me fifteen minutes and I'll look and I'm like okay sure why not? why not my friend?
B	if he does buy it I'm gonna laugh I'm gonna laugh so hard I could technically get the dresses and not pay for the pictures and just delete him
A	yeah that's I thought that's what the plan is
B	yeah
A	cos he probably won't ask for and he probably won't pay you for the pictures
B	no
A	cos he paid for the clothes
B	paid for clothes
A	that's the deal isn't it?
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to have a sandwich	Contradiction
B	but what if he could track me down somehow? how could he track me down?
A	he wouldn't be able to
B	I could just delete everything and be like
A	yeah
B	wa
A	that's kind of the beauty of it really isn't it? cos you haven't given anyone your bank details or anything so I mean even if you gave somebody your bank details all they'd be able to do is give you money
B	no yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Person B agrees that kind of the beauty of it	Entailment
A	these are all hideous
B	yeah they are
A	who who would wear that?
B	I know
A	that is awful
B	it looks like a Christmas present almost
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cuts	Contradiction
A	it's horrible
B	I like the plainer ones not the ones on here but like plainer dresses
A	yeah I know that's the problem like I'm so not wearing any of this stuff like ever this is not my style
B	yeah yeah
A	that I'm into
B	who?
A	what is that?
B	it's thirty-five pounds
A	it's disgusting
B	I was looking for them before but I couldn't really find any

B	oh my god she looks really cool
A	yeah she's from
B	is she from
A	yeah cos she knew my sister cos they did like fashion shows and stuff

B	oh there's some underwear oh
A	that would be nice it is nice having like a matching set or something
B	nice underwear yeah lovely
B	he said he'd
A	I don't think he'd mind if you were wearing undewear
B	I don't think he would you know somehow
B	unless be quite funny if he was a gay guy just like looking nice
A	yeah I was wondering that cos the fact that he doesn't want you to buy like you know provocative clothing
B	party Xmas peace and love erm
B	clothing
A	do you want like a drink or something from the kitchen?
B	erm no thanks I'm alright
A	oh ow
A	are you talking to yourself?

B	you see this well actually I don't like any of these bras these look uncomfortable
A	which ones?
B	these all these look really uncomfy like look at them
A	yeah that does not look comfortable
B	how did you?
A	cos they're push-up aren't they so? get like a non-padded one they're like really pretty sometimes
B	yeah non-padded here we go oh look the red bra
A	that's nice
B	yeah I like bras I don't have enough bras let's get some bras
A	I don't get this thing where people find bras uncomfortable like
B	some are but some are really like more comfy most of the time for me
A	yeah but I don't even feel it when I'm wearing a bra really and everyone's always like oh I wish like we didn't have to wear bras and I mean I don't feel it at all
B	mm me I'm don't really have much pain with my boobs cos my
A	no
B	my boobs are quite small so it's not like
A	I know you're so lucky
B	I dunno what size they are like a B or an A like it's really bad
A	yeah I really have tiny boobs as well
A	treasure it
B	like if I I see the my my sister has to hold hers when she goes upstairs
A	yeah
B	and I don't I I wouldn't
A	I know I know mine aren't that big but it's just like tops and stuff it makes it a lot harder
B	mm
A	cos you can't wear certain things
B	cos like you have quite small boobs
A	mm really
B	like really small boobs
A	they used to be bigger than this it was horrendous horrendous like
B	really?
A	mm
B	wow
A	yeah all my family have like massive boobs
B	what? what happened?
B	yeah goes off your boobs first
A	yeah which is kind of annoying but
B	log out here we if this became a regular thing though I could get so much clotheslike imagine that I I'm kind of
A	mm
B	erm
A	just plain
B	I have one lovely sparkly dress at home but it's special but I don't really like them in general
A	mm
B	but erm
A	well you never have a chance to wear them really like what are you gonna wear them for?
B	I know
B	it's not a proper dress no let's see if I can get a coat oh
A	mm that'll be nice
B	coat
A	is it just Missguided like nothing else?
B	erm
A	not like Urban Outfitters or Topshop
B	I
A	ow
B	I was like how about Topshop sir?
A	although Topshop's not really that much better than that anyway really
B	I'll search Topshop because Topshop can
A	erm I imagine so
B	slip dresses you see they have slip
A	oh my AOL
A	I hate that
B	they're all like a clan
A	yeah
B	oh my god that's lovely
A	oh wow
B	oh my god

A	oh I love that
B	it's not bad
B	particularly the fact that I might not have to pay it
A	yeah
A	no
B	okay erm dresses here we go
B	it does make you feel like shit doesn't it?
A	oh
B	it's really nice but it's short-term
B	it's like I'll just get this and then no
A	I just don't wanna get fat
B	you're not fat
A	that's the issue no I don't wanna get fat
B	at our age we have high metabolisms
A	yeah but it no I don't anymore like that was my problem like I used to be like a rake when I was younger cos I like didn't I hadn't like developed since since I was like fourteen or something and before that I had a really high metabolism I I could eat whatever I wanted and never put any weight on at all and it was so strange like I was yeah I was weirdly thin but it wasn't like a health issue it was just the way my body was at the time
B	just the way you are yeah
A	yeah
B	you're still thin now though like
A	yeah I just it's just annoying cos you have to keep hold of it really don't you? like you have to like actually do things to
A	properly but I don't
B	life's too short to care
A	yeah that's true I just think when I'm fifty I'll start to like get really fat
B	to be fair
A	to make up for all the years
B	it's good to be fatter than skinny when you're older because
A	really?
B	when you look
A	not really skinny I just don't wanna have like a chin I just don't wanna have loads of chins like old people have chins
A	that's what I worry about
B	some old people can't put weight on though some
A	yeah mm
B	it's usually old men that get chubbier
A	I just
B	oh
B	you won't but don't worry about that
B	erm
A	you know you can do like view all instead of like flicking through?
B	yeah I was thinking that I was thinking that I was like you know?
