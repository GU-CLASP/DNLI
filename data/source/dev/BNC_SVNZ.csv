A	okay so we're recording now?
B	yep
A	okay so tell me about your day cos you haven't done that yet
B	oh well I think it was raining on the way it was a bit miserable
A	did you have to deal with
B	no
A	well that was lucky
B	yeah it was good
A	okay
B	and em bought some milk for the tea
A	well just for oh okay
B	well no it's shared milk
A	okay
B	and even if we're fifty people em well because there are fifty you'll find it doesn't last very long
A	no
B	did you go shopping?
A	em no
B	mm fair enough
A	that was that
B	yeah go on
A	okay
B	smoking
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a didn't go shopping today	Entailment
A	why?
B	because it's lovely
B	well you know if you are ever feeling a bit stressed you go you can have a nice cigarette and it calms you all down although it actually stresses the body but it relaxes the mind and you can em eh get an excuse to go outside as well and have a chat with people and get away from from the desk
A	mm
B	but it isn't very good for your health
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is a smoker	Neutral
A	it isn't
B	eh well I'd already stopped before the ban came in so it didn't really affect me
A	ah
B	how do you how did you get past it?
A	well what I mean is that your first for most people the first taste of cigarette is horrible
B	yeah it's just to push past it
A	I know but why would you push past it?
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a quit smoking	Entailment
B	oh I see  I see  em well I first smoked a pipe which is a bit unusual but that was very strong it nearly made me sick when I first tried it
B	so I eh I tried that and that was oh terribly strong but I did push past it
A	no that's true
B	but I sort of I trained myself to do it by just trying it
A	okay
B	it's funny what you'll do in the cause of em sociability I suppose
A	did you have many friends that smoked?
B	eh yes yes a few
[ANNOTATION]	most people don't smoke pipe	Entailment
A	oh
B	there was a bit of peer pressure involved
A	mm
B	so I took up cigarettes after a year or two of pipe smoking
A	okay
B	you've never smoked though have you?
A	well em
B	ah I'm gonna get a confession now
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a smokes weed	Neutral
A	well no you could  you could  never say that I smoked as such
B	mm
A	and em
B	mm
A	like almost sort of liked it and then if I went to parties or something then I might just sort of take some cigarette and have a drag and and that was it
B	well I didn't know that
A	and I kind eh well I know but I didn't know you then
A	so that was the end of that I think
B	lovely
A	em yeah so that was but I think that was the last eh the last time I actually tried a cigarette
B	it was a cigar wasn't it?
A	was eh was yeah on our wedding day when I tried your cigar and it was revolting
B	mm
A	what my my preferred vice?
B	yeah presumably not smoking?
A	not smoking em well I've never really been interested in in drugs so cos I don't well I'm gonna contradict myself here
B	right
A	so I would love to be able to think oh you can drink not not to getting really drunk but
B	do you find it has more more or less of an effect as you get older?
A	em probably more
B	yeah I think so
A	I think I had I think but there are I think the trouble is though that alcohol is is well wine is em is stronger new world wine is stronger and em
B	well that's just
A	and that stuff that's fifteen percent the stuff we just had
B	it's not us getting weaker then
B	yeah I think
A	I think it is a bit of both and I think if you I think if you're
B	yeah it makes you thirsty
A	whereas and also I think that em because the trend is to drink more wine with things like red wine you have all the congealers and and things that I think can give you more of a headache whereas if you have
B	mm
A	something like gin or vodka I think that
B	ah that would be handy
A	what if you could drink and and it it could relax you but it you could still drive? That would be so cool because we could go out to restaurants and things
B	yeah
A	and not have to worry about thirty pounds for a taxi
B	that's right it would save money on taxis and it's so annoying when other people are having fun and you're not
A	yeah
B	but you don't get in the mood
A	yeah
B	so em yeah that that would be a good drug to invent now wouldn't it? One with no eh no after effects or you could take an antidote straight away and it would cure you and then you'd be back to normal that's
A	but I don't  I don't  Well I was going to say I don't take alcohol primarily for the  for the  effect but I must do to a certain extent because if I didn't then I'd just have Ribena which would be a lot cheaper
B	mm
A	if it really if the effect really didn't have any
B	as opposed to what the taste you mean? I suppose
A	yeah because like for example it's always  it's always  struck me as rather odd like say something like vodka and em
B	yeah
A	and I've always thought that was a bit odd because why would you have an alcoholic drink that you can't taste?
B	so you can get drunk
A	well yeah I know but I I always think that sounds really really immature
B	yeah
A	but anyway
B	okay
A	mm hm
B	I mean you could say you've got so much of both my love that's wonderful
B	but maybe a more eh you know descriptive answer would help
A	well that's very interesting isn't it? Because you hear about these people ah like well
B	yeah
A	and could be very and have a really really high level of intelligence but they can't  they can't  deal with the most basic things
B	so they can be brilliant at maths for example can't they?
A	yeah yeah but it's
B	but then they can't do up their trousers or something ridiculous
A	yeah
B	or cross the road or certainly they're poor at social skills aren't they? Traditionally
A	yes yes a lot of people who have got very high intelligence
[ANNOTATION]	People who are very intelligent might have problems in other areas of their lives.	Entailment
B	mm
A	em I suppose eh from a sort of survival point of view common sense is more important but but do you know what you how often have you and I said that if people just  if people just  did the job they had to do and and got on with it then it would be so much
B	but what's that then?
A	businesses would run so much smoothly
B	what's that common sense or intelligence?
A	no that's common sense to me
B	mm mm
A	so for example oh I don't know em if I'm
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	People who have autism may suffer from this as well.	Neutral
A	that basically I'm ringing up cos I'm doing your admin you're at work and blah blah blah and then say oh no we can't give it to you because em
B	yeah yeah
A	because of what's that stupid law? The Data Protection Act or something
B	yeah
A	but then having said that it's probably not their fault but what else? Em
B	well I think it's a  it's a  bit of a trick question really because if you  if you  have one without the other you're really a bit stuck
[ANNOTATION]	A has been doing admin work for twenty years now.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	and what is common sense apart from intelligence that's become a regular you know eh activity
A	that thing's gone off
B	em hopefully it's still working let's find out
A	em I suppose you wouldn't have you'd have no em you'd have no well would you? Well I was going to say that you wouldn't have like some brilliant inventors
B	I think my yeah
A	mm
B	and it seems like Spock say in Star Trek
B	he's the one with the pointy ears
A	yeah
B	he basically he lives by logic and he has no emotions or very few and so he is seen as intelligence but without eh he has got common sense though but he just doesn't have feelings so
A	I suppose it's it's it's interesting isn't it how you define them but I suppose the the question sort of getting at the sort of the basic sort of
[ANNOTATION]	Spock, who is in Star Trek, tries to live a logic life.	Entailment
B	yeah that's yeah
[ANNOTATION]	People who are incredibly intelligent hardly ever have problems with socialising.	Contradiction
[ANNOTATION]	It is better to have intelligence without common sense.	Contradiction
A	as opposed to thinking of greater
B	so how do those terms apply to him?
A	em well what I'm thinking of obviously not very clearly is that to me intelligence is something that is more academic that is a  is a  higher level
B	oh okay
A	and you have to almost make deductions about things mainly
B	so logical logical original thinking and identification of the facts as opposed to doing things out of habit would be one way of looking at it
A	maybe
B	well I think you could do a question now cos it was a bit tricky that one
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks that intelligence is nothing more than academics.	Contradiction
B	mm
A	ah this is interesting
B	ooh culture?
A	yeah
B	so that could be any time or place couldn't it? Is that right?
A	eh possibly
B	em well I'd say Greek civilization
A	really?
B	yeah
A	but you wouldn't have electric blankets or iPods
B	I know but it's warm in Greece I wouldn't worry about that
A	mm
B	I think
A	mm that's interesting
B	probably wouldn't live nearly as long we'd be dead by now probably
A	no
B	eh
A	the first thing that springs to mind with me is thinking okay what culture do women have em near equality with men?
B	Good point
A	em
B	eh mm
A	em then that I suppose that leaves America which I haven't really thought about
B	it varies a lot depending on which part you go to as you know
A	yeah
B	very very different
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	but every now and then you still come across real sort of misogyny and these sort of dark age ideas em
B	like when?
A	well I was thinking about oh gosh a few weeks ago I was just listening to Jeremy Vine and he was oh there was some story about a Canadian policeman who said to  who said to  women if you don't want to get raped then don't dress like sluts or something like that
B	yeah
A	and and first of all I thought well that is goes back to our common sense cos that's kind of common sense but then I was listening to what people were were were ringing in with and there was such misogyny
B	were any of the callers women?
A	yeah they were old women
B	yeah interesting
A	em but there another
B	no he'd be jolly glad probably
A	whereas the opposite if you had a non
B	oh yeah
A	gypsy woman
B	yes
A	and her husband expected her to clean all the time and you know
B	yeah that wouldn't work
A	never change a nappy and and not be present at the birth of a child and all the rest of it I think that would be harder
B	yeah
A	but anyway
B	but in the present time you mean?
A	yeah I think so
B	oh yeah
A	couldn't be in a time where you know women couldn't be couldn't give their opinions on things
B	yeah
A	so
B	well good answer I think
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B think it's right too	Entailment
