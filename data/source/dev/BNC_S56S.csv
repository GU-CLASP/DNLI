B	yes we used to go we used to used to go there quite a lot
A	yes yes I expect you did it's a nice place to take visitors
B	well it's lovely just there yeah that's right
A	if you've got children they can run around that's always helpful
B	be able to see loads of geese running around
A	yes
B	they had those for some years
A	yes
B	well I suppose there must be new ones
A	they might be a family cos one of them looked quite young
A	it was a smaller
A	yes that's right they're quite vicious actually aren't they poultry? they pick on each other
A	yes he's but they didn't do very well did they?
B	no er they get lost and
A	yes they got lost or someone stole them
B	yeah yeah stole them yeah that's it
A	they might've been stolen you know
B	yeah
A	for a rare breed they were probably quite expensive
B	oh was it a rare breed?
A	yes
B	so that's the black face was it?
A	quite yes they were quite distinctive there wasn't any others I forget what they were called
B	well
A	yes those flowers are lovely grandpa in the window
A	beautiful
B	oh they
A	yes it's lovely having flowers in the house
B	yes I think we've got some I suppose now
A	yes
B	on that on that right-hand side there's supposed to be bulbs in well there are bulbs in there
A	well I expect you've got loads of daffodils
B	course they don't come out so much cos the trees got too tall and keep the light out
A	yes that's the trouble yes that's right yes I want to get my
B	I think I had it dug in and they were still there
B	and I took a trowel out
A	yes yes they don't go away do they?
B	no no no they
A	mm yes
B	yes I must take them out and put them somewhere
B	cos your
A	yes
B	is it? oh
A	well they're like one point eight metre fences but they didn't
B	oh
A	er put them on the ground to begin with they started them off about twenty centimetres above the ground they're over two metres
B	oh
A	it's only a tiny garden so it's blocking all the light
B	so it's
A	yes well I'm wondering about sawing a bit off the top because they've got two bars so I could take it down to the top bar and it wouldn't show much that would be about that much it's about six inches isn't it?
B	oh that's not much no
A	no well it might not be enough to make a difference
B	oh oh well
A	but it's worth a try do you think?
B	can you knock them? can you knock them all down if you want to?
A	I could do I own them all
B	oh well then so well yes
A	it seems a bit silly cos it's a new house and I feel erm
A	bit bad yes might spoil it but
B	cos we we found all the trees round here actually
A	yes you see trees would too be too big for the space
B	yeah in yours yeah yeah
A	and I think even a hedge would take up too much room but what I needed I should've put in lower fences cos the one at the back and the side they put in
B	yeah
A	but I paid for the one in the middle and I shouldn't've done that I should've erm
B	yeah
A	cos if you wanted the free one it was just wire and rail but that's no good either I mean a wire and rail
B	no
A	is nothing but I needed something in between so I should've really paid for my own fencing
B	yeah
A	I suppose over time that's what I'll do I'll just have them
A	replaced and put in one point five metre or
B	yeah or
A	I don't know I'll have to have a look but it's a bit annoying it's blocking out all the light
B	yes well we had we had them all going up the back gate at one time and I think I cut those down cos it's
A	oh right yes
B	in no time you get a
A	oh right yes
A	oh that's nice yeah
B	yeah
A	roses are lovely
B	I think that's rose er and and also the spring bulbs are in there somewhere
A	yes
B	I I think I'll see if can try them out
A	oh right oh that's nice
B	but whether it's got too dark I don't know
A	yeah yes perhaps so mm
B	so have to call you you're the gardening expert
A	I like gardening yeah
B	yeah nice it's nice to out in the garden of course isn't it?
A	it is nice it's good exercise too I started some pumpkin plants growing
B	oh you like pumpkins do you?
A	I love them yeah
B	oh I never liked them
A	we don't eat them much in this country
B	no I know I've forgotten oh
A	oh really? oh
B	somebody had pumpkins somewhere
A	yes they're more popular aren't they in other countries?
B	did they grow? do they grow them in Egypt?
A	I expect so yes
B	just er pumpkins or somewhere like that?
A	yes cos they like the heat more don't they? they don't like our climate so much
B	yeah
A	especially to start them off you have to start them off inside for quite a long time
A	and then put them outside from about April
B	oh yes
A	yeah
B	if they're under the trees they stay there they just keep growing got
A	that's right
B	yeah
A	yes I expect there's loads
B	need you down for extra for the gardening
A	that's right
A	yes I wouldn't mind that job
A	yes I saw him
B	that's right that's right that's right
A	what's his name?
A	it's okay
B	what's what's his name?
A	just called the gardener
B	just called the gardener
B	I think he's working
A	oh right
B	somebody told me
A	oh right oh that's good
B	so he must be quite a good gardener
A	so he knows yes that's right
B	yeah I think so
A	yes he probably knows his plants
B	he usually has a chat with with
A	oh right
B	cut the he won't cut things down unless we agreed to it first of all I
A	oh that's nice but it's good he just gets on with it
B	he does yes and it's a case of one man and his dog with him cos he's always got his dog with him
A	yeah that's nice
B	yeah
A	very nice
B	yes your mum's very good at getting chatting with people she used to be very shy when she was a young person
A	she's quite chatty isn't she? yes that's right
B	she's she's very good at chatting now
A	dad's got better too cos he used to be quite bad at talking to people didn't he?
A	yeah although he didn't like talking to anybody
B	no no no
A	and now he talks to everybody
B	yes I noticed when we've been to visit them
A	yes
B	er oh if you're on the road in in the village everybody seems to know your dad
A	that's right
B	they don't always know your mum but they know they know
A	yes yes he's very chatty well cos he goes down to the the leisure centre a lot for his swimming and all sorts
B	oh oh yes yeah well that's it
A	so he knows people from there
B	yes you don't have to bother with exercises
A	well I
B	yeah
A	I suppose I do a bit of walking and gardening
B	well that's nice
A	and yoga I've started doing yoga again
B	oh have you?
A	yes go to class in the town it's not on in the holidays but erm it's once a week at the school
B	is that a Japanese thing yoga?
A	erm
B	or Chinese?
A	Indian I think
B	it's Indian is it?
A	yeah very old
B	oh yes
A	sort of stretching yes quite difficult
A	yeah
B	yeah well there we go
A	but I like it it's nice it's relaxing
A	you sleep well afterwards
B	have you have you got a you've got a little place you said you go to?
A	they do it in the school
B	oh yes the school?
A	it's a professional erm leisure centre but they do outreach classes so they come
B	oh I see
A	to us so that's quite nice and it's only five pounds a session which is actually quite cheap
B	oh well
A	it's pretty good and there's only five people in the class I'm getting a good deal
B	oh well yeah
A	so I don't want to tell anyone in my town about it in case they start showing up
B	oh
A	that'll be annoying
B	yeah that's right no no
A	yes
B	who
A	yeah
B	who supported all that? does the council support it?
A	erm that's the leisure centre they somehow make money out of that
B	don't have too much out of you then
A	no I don't quite understand they don't advertise very well cos you'd think they'd be putting leaflets through people's door or something but they don't do any of that
B	I have a feeling there's something like that in
A	it's a good idea and they hire local teachers so I suppose they're not bringing them out from
B	no no no no that's right
A	hiring a room might be in a school is only about ten pounds for an hour
A	so it's not a huge amount
B	oh no no
A	then they're paying the instructor another ten and they take the remainder I suppose
B	oh well that sounds reasonable
A	yes I suppose it works out quite well in fact maybe that's the way things should go they should just
B	do you go weekly to that?
A	yeah I've been going weekly yes
B	oh well that's nice
A	yes quite tiring though you'd be surprised
B	oh was it? don't think grandma ever did anything like that?
A	did she go to classes?
A	oh that's nice yeah
B	no I've
A	no I never got into it no I got two left feet I have
B	oh
A	well me too I know
A	I'm always treading on people's feet
B	dear
A	yeah but
B	yeah
A	and so she used to organise all these concerts occasionally
B	oh that's nice
A	and play in them at the same time
B	yeah
A	I think we've got a picture upstairs of your grandma playing the piece of a witch
B	oh right
A	she's all dressed up in black
B	oh that's nice
A	I think there's erm a photograph somewhere
B	oh lovely
A	yeah
A	but she used to do
B	yes
A	that was long long before she became Catholic
B	oh yes
B	it's closed now though the one she used to go to
A	yeah I expect a lot of those small ones have haven't they?
B	yeah they've all become shops now yeah
A	right where was that?
B	in
A	oh in
B	in
A	mm but she lived on the edge of town did she?
B	yeah just on the edge
A	mm
B	yeah she had erm oh it was right on the edge of the town I suppose
A	yeah and you lived in
B	cos she used to used to tell me like er she said when she about a teenager young youngster erm everyone all her friends had modern houses
A	yes
B	she used to be envious of those
A	yes
B	and but but her friends were always envious of her house
A	yes
B	cos we used to own a little cottage
A	ah and did you live in
B	did I live in
A	oh
B	yeah in
A	yes I thought so but when did you move down this way? when you were young or as an adult?
B	no I
A	oh okay
B	it's when they built the new factory you see?
A	oh the Cellophane one?
B	I
A	ah right ah yes that must've been a big move
B	well yes the that's right it was a big move there I suppose
A	yes
B	cos that that man
A	yes quite exciting
B	it was quite exciting yes
A	yes is that still going that factory? used to be when I was younger cos I remember it
B	yes I I'm not sure whether it's what's happened to it now I think there are lots of other mini factories built on the grounds
A	oh right
B	cos I remember going up to
A	yes
B	I seem to remember looking over and seeing it had all been erm developed
A	oh right oh interesting
B	what used to happen
A	probably was quite small before wasn't it?
B	cos oddly enough erm er your er
A	oh
A	yes
B	we always remember you see
A	no
A	yeah well they must've trusted him if he was sent down to start up a new factory that's a big responsibility isn't it?
A	yes
B	most of the sort of er people at the top end
A	ah they got called up? ah right
B	yeah and so then people like my dad was older cos he
A	he was too old to go yeah
B	he was in the First World War not the Second
A	yes yes
B	so he was erm more or less in charge of weekends in the whole factory or something
A	cor yeah that's quite a responsibility
B	yeah yeah yeah they had about five hundred workers there
A	yeah
B	they had something of that size yeah
A	oh that's huge
B	yeah
A	yes and did it stay making Cellophane
A	yes but it was it's the Cellophane factory it was Sellotape and things wasn't it?
B	that's right
A	but I remember the smell of it when I was growing up you could smell it yeah
B	yeah that's you could
A	yeah yes but I expect you know in the war they could've recommissioned it and made other things perhaps if they'd wanted to
A	yes
A	oh yes
B	what were they called? anyway
A	like the
B	yeah there was he was something in the war yeah so
A	mm
A	no I don't know
B	they were volunteers in some way
A	yes
B	and he used to run one of the one of those
A	mm
B	something something like that they were good good pals really they were he was much higher ranked than my father but er yeah
B	yeah he fought
A	yeah
B	fought all the all the alright through Belgium and France yeah
A	oh right oh
B	yeah oh and he took my mother there
A	oh did he? oh that's nice
B	they went to all all the all the fighting in the where he was yeah
A	that's very nice yeah
B	but er have you been to France?
A	yes yes
B	cos in lots of little corners in France little centres they have don't they little
A	little memorials
B	that's right showing who's been killed here sort of thing
A	yes that's right
B	yeah
A	yeah mm
B	course course grandma used to like France yes she spoke reasonably good French
A	that's right yeah she did didn't she?
B	and and her
B	yeah that's right she is learning
A	which is not that dissimilar in terms of vocabulary quite similar
B	is it? yes
B	yeah
A	you can see it quite clearly what's linked
B	well how many languages have you got under your sleeve now?
A	mm erm Spanish
A	and Japanese
B	oh right
A	just about got English not quite there
B	oh well
A	but still learning but Arabic I never got very far with
B	that's tough going
A	that was very tough going yeah
B	they write left the wrong way round don't they
A	yes that's right no it's not easy at all
B	yeah I can imagine that's difficult no no no no
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you spent some years though didn't you out there?
A	yeah five years
B	yeah thought you were
A	went fast
B	yeah
A	that five years went very quickly
B	yeah
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a spent ten years out there	Contradiction
A	no
A	I'd had I'd had enough the last year and a half I'd really had enough
A	yes but I wanted to save up for the house so
B	now you've got it
A	it was the quickest way to legally shortcut the system so
B	oh was it?
A	cos I didn't have to pay tax
B	oh
A	and that is what cripples you in this country
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a bought themselves a house	Entailment
B	yeah
A	er your tax bill because it's not just the income tax it's the National Insurance
B	yes a lot yeah
A	and then the other thing is your rent the rent's horrendous in this country so
B	yeah
A	with those together it's difficult to save so I just thought well I'm going to shortcut it
B	and buy one
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a used to live in Venezuela	Neutral
A	yes
B	oh
A	no mortgage
B	no
A	it's nice
A	yeah
B	sounds marvellous you've got the place to your own
A	yes
B	out of your own money not paying rent or anything
A	that's right and I can rent that second bedroom out
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b finds it a very nice option	Entailment
B	yeah
A	yeah so it makes yes it makes life very comfortable
B	yes yeah no that's really super
A	have you rented it out already have you?
B	but only with Airbnb so just erm
A	oh I see
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b has a house in Manchester	Neutral
B	a few nights a week cos I don't really want someone there all the time
A	it could be a bit boring with er one sort
B	yes but I mean people keep asking me
A	mm
B	can can we rent it every week? and I keep saying no
A	oh no oh cos people who are in there have been asking to?
B	yes people staying short-term say well look I'm down here every week so can I just rent it five days a week until August? until now I've said no but I mean I think it's just probably a case of finding the right person
[ANNOTATION]	no one has asked for times shorter than a week	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	but I don't really want to advertise it cos I don't want to be stuck with people I don't like
A	oh no no no
B	but erm
A	you don't really know who you like until you've had them though do you?
B	well that's the trouble isn't it? you can't tell from
B	I mean what are you going to tell from an email or even a phone call? there's there's
B	I mean they need to be in the house what I've said to this next lady who's coming in two weeks is look you can come and stay for five days and we'll make a decision based on that
A	yeah
B	erm
A	cos I wouldn't want you or me to be uncomfortable so
B	yeah
A	yes but
B	oh
A	Muslim lady so she's not going likely to be bringing men back is she?
B	oh no
A	or drinking or anything like that
B	no no
A	so erm she might be alright actually
B	well in my day the ladies I can always remember the ladies erm used to go down to the pub for the jug the beer
B	the ladies did yeah take it back to their house like
A	oh right of course cos
B	for the husband to drink yeah that used to be
A	oh it wasn't for them to drink?
B	no no
B	well she may've drunk some as well
A	yes
B	but then that's what that's what it used to be
A	it shows beer must've been cheap though mustn't it in the pub in those days?
A	cos nowadays no one could afford to do that
B	no no no
A	break your break the bank
A	no
B	yes but it used to be
A	the pubs are really expensive
B	used to be the used to be the natural thing actually
A	yes well it's nice isn't it?
B	yeah
A	I mean it's
B	yeah
B	well not that they drunk very much as far as I remember
A	no just as a once a week thing perhaps
B	yeah cos that's grandpa's side that's my mother's side there he used to be er a painter used to paint pictures
A	oh right? oh
B	and they used to sell them off sell them like they used to make a bit of money
A	that's nice yeah it's good to have a hobby like that isn't it?
A	aw yes that's really a shame
B	yeah that's wrong yeah
A	yes and they had a personal
B	well they are really
A	you know meaning as well
B	I think it was obviously some relative of the family
A	well yes which was
A	bit dishonest of them
B	little bit dishonest yeah
A	yeah
B	cos my I know mother wanted one of the pictures
A	yes well you would wouldn't you?
A	yes even if it was just one it's nice to have a memory
B	well he used to be quite good at those he was always on got commissions for it you know for for paintings
A	oh right yes
[ANNOTATION]	someone gets paid for paintings	Entailment
A	mm
B	so yeah hasn't gone down the line in the family cos I'm I'm
A	no I'm hopeless
B	no no good at painting
A	dad's not bad my dad
B	is he good at painting? oh yes he used to be didn't he?
A	mm he's not bad at all
B	he used to do rural scenes didn't he? yeah
A	yes he's
B	yeah
A	quite good but no on our like no hopeless
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	dad's paintings sold for high prices	Neutral
A	I'm hopeless absolutely hopeless
B	I I can't even draw a circle let alone anything else
A	no I'm not practical at all though like that
B	no
A	but I suppose everyone's got something I've got the garden I suppose
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not good at painting	Entailment
A	that's somewhat creative isn't it?
B	yes well well yes I know when I first joined the Royal Air Force they wanted wanted wanted me to be doing sketching things and with a pencil
A	oh yes
B	cos you had to
A	yes so you don't shoot the wrong one down
B	that's right that's about it yes
B	we had these sort of where the engines were they could be lowered down or a bit more that way that
A	well right yes I suppose that's a good way to check people understand isn't it?
B	well we had some we used to have oh we used to
A	they'd say what's that
B	well no no that's
A	never seen a plane like that
[ANNOTATION]	the plane is hand-drawn	Neutral
B	no no that's right I no I was never good at drawing I couldn't
A	no I'm hopeless
B	I couldn't draw circles
A	on my school report it used to say
[ANNOTATION]	they are good at drawing	Contradiction
A	effort A realisation C
A	and that was being generous
A	I used to have straight As on my reports apart from
B	yeah
A	art never got on with art although I quite like making things from clay
[ANNOTATION]	clay is fun to play with	Entailment
A	I have found I'm better with that sort of thing
B	oh yes rather than drawing yeah
A	yes but then that's more shaping it isn't it? it's not that difficult
B	cos dad wasn't bad at sketching was he?
A	no he's pretty good actually
B	but I've I've seen one or two of his things he's sketched
A	yeah
B	he's given up now
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes that's right he gave up for a bit and he never really got back into it
B	oh well should have plenty of time
A	he's got lots of interests which is good cos he did
B	did he do French did he?
A	mm when he had retired
A	and he's got the yeah spinning and things and all sorts yeah
B	oh
A	yeah so that's good
B	I remember that mum well she must've known a bit of French I suppose did she?
A	mum's never got into languages has she? she's never really got on with them
B	oh well they used to be
A	yes they must've done yeah
B	yeah I thought
A	we're not much good in this country at languages are we?
B	no we expect everybody to speak English
A	that's the trouble yes
B	yeah
A	because of that
B	and some guy said that to me once
A	well yes it's true apparently it's getting worse though because of globalisation
B	mm
A	and their power they expect people to speak to them in their language
B	they want Chinese?
A	they expect people to speak to them in their language
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	and the British can't compete with that whereas other European countries can they'll say fine we'll learn Russian
B	yeah
A	fine we'll learn Chinese and they do so Britain's going to get in more and more trouble over this it's interesting
B	yes I
A	mm
B	I was
A	yes it's true though isn't it?
B	I think that's probably true I suppose yeah
A	yes
B	and their country used to say that try and do in their country
A	that's right I mean it's different in your own country cos you know that's fine
B	yeah
A	but when you travel it's true we do
B	do
A	expect people to speak English and we're a bit surprised when they don't but of course we shouldn't really be surprised
B	yeah yeah
A	suppose it depends where they work though if someone worked in tourism you would expect them to speak English cos it is
B	yeah
A	a global language isn't it?
B	probably yeah
A	but if someone works in construction well there's no particular reason for them to learn
B	no
A	if they're working in the Middle
B	well your language you've got quite good at languages haven't you?
A	yeah I don't like them I've decided
B	yeah
A	I can do it but it's not a something I enjoy
B	no no
A	I find it quite annoying it's very tiring speaking another language I find
B	well yeah actually you never quite know you've got it right do you? no no
A	that's right and you can never quite guess it exactly what you want to say or I never could I think
B	oh
A	you'd have to be incredibly good to get to that point so you're always kind of approximating
B	oh
A	which is frustrating I find
A	yeah she was wasn't she?
B	French language I remember she never admitted being well but whenever we used to go to France she would always argue argue with the chap
B	barter with the Frenchman
A	that's good
B	cos she yeah she was able to come away the winner I think
A	yes
B	oh I know once yeah she was somewhere
A	mm
B	and so he said to your mum stay there I run away I come back with another one
B	yeah so she obviously understood what he was saying
A	yes
B	yeah
B	oh she always said the the language teacher she had wasn't very good
A	no well I think looking back at school my teachers were terrible
B	what in in the er in the French
A	in secondary school absolutely awful
B	yeah
A	so I had this one in year seven when I was eleven she was suicidal I mean
B	oh
A	actually threatened to jump out of a window a very highly strung woman and once you know we wouldn't be quiet so she got out on the roof
B	did she?
A	during the class it was a flat roof but nevertheless a roof
B	mm?
A	and she said if you don't be quiet I'm going to jump out of the window class we just had enough of her I mean she was like a child attention seeking child you know?
B	oh
A	so we said go on then so she off she went out on the roof and we locked her out and we left her there
B	oh dear
A	so then she was like let me in let me in and of course no one let her in so she had to go round to the next class
B	oh you you
A	and she came when she came back in she said right all of you are on detention tomorrow and we didn't turn up
B	oh
A	and there wasn't anything she could do I mean how ridiculous? threatening to jump out of the window when you're the teacher
B	yeah yeah yeah they were a tough lot of people in your classroom then?
A	oh I don't know she shouldn't've been teaching
B	mm yes
A	so we never learnt anything with her that was about two years
B	which school was that then?
A	saint
B	oh that's your father's school
A	yeah
B	oh oh well
A	language department then we had this German teacher who couldn't control the class and he
B	oh golly yeah
A	but the the witnesses saw the car number plate and they told the police the car number plate and they found him and because it was a hit and run he ended up on the front page of the local newspaper
B	oh no
A	and of course everybody found out at the school
B	who it was yeah
A	he got banned from driving and had to come on our school but and of course he never lived it down so that was that
B	oh
A	he never had any control
B	was he a teacher what?
A	yes er my German teacher and he in the end he just started crying in the middle of the class
B	oh
A	and that was that we never had any respect for him
B	oh dear
A	no fancy driving off after hitting someone that's dreadful isn't it? yes
B	well that's terrible really isn't it? panic I suppose
A	he did but that's not good enough I
B	well not really someone could be dying on the road yeah
A	no that's right they could've been dying just very callous
B	yeah that's right
A	but he should've been in prison I think for that I think that's terrible
B	yeah
A	driving off after an accident
A	is I mean it's
B	you still read about that occasionally now don't you? people just drive off
A	oh yes yes yes there was that case the other day wasn't there with that erm burglar? and the police were chasing him and they had one of those stingers you know they throw out those mats that puncture the tyres
B	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
A	and he drove
B	yes well
A	he didn't show any remorse
B	no no no you just see someone on the spur of the moment do something like that but sounds terrible yeah
A	yes he was on drugs at the time
B	oh oh well yes
A	yes his friend's gone to jail too though
B	I've never er I've never don't think I've ever tried them
A	sorry?
B	I never tried them so
B	drugs no no
A	but his friend went to jail too who was a passenger and I thought well that was a bit mean
B	yeah
A	because there wasn't much he could do it would be spur of the moment you know the he's driven at the policeman
B	yeah
A	so you're not really an accomplice to murder are you?
B	not really no
A	I thought that was a bit mean
B	yeah
A	that you know he may've egged him or he may not but either way the responsibility lies with the driver
B	yeah
A	and not with the passenger
B	yeah
A	so I don't know maybe there were some
A	but they're always like that the police aren't they? if you kill one of their own
B	yeah you're in trouble
A	oh that's it the book is gonna be thrown at you
B	oh
A	and that's it and
B	yeah
A	you'll get a hard time in prison over that
B	yeah
A	they won't like that
B	was it prisoners
A	dad
B	yes some prisoners when they committed crimes against the norm they get a bad time in prison don't they?
A	yeah dad says that
B	they do sometimes yes
A	especially if it's children
B	yeah that's right
A	they get a very hard time in prison
B	oh that's that's that's what I heard from them
A	and they used to be protected used to be if you were a paedophile and you went to prison they wouldn't tell the other prisoners
B	oh
A	what you'd done
B	cos they'll beat you up
A	because they knew
B	oh
A	but there's been a lot of deaths in custody over the last year it's not only because of that but there's been a huge increase in suicides and
B	yeah
A	there was a stabbing at the Dartmoor prison one prisoner stabbing another to death really gruesome about December
B	was it that recently?
A	very recently yeah made the the news but that dad said it's because they're very understaffed and they can't send in one prison guard on his own if someone's got a weapon so they have to wait so they had to wait until this guy was stabbed to death and then go and get him
A	oh right
B	not into where the people were but sitting outside looking at the prisoners you could see them all carrying stuff around
A	yes they work up there don't they? they do they have jobs up there
B	yeah that's where they worked yeah they could see them going around
A	yeah which is good I think because it gives them occupies your mind as well and they pay them actually
B	they also
A	that not very much
B	oh well that's better nothing I suppose
A	yes but I think it's about eleven pounds a week
B	I think your dad was easily recognised I think they recognised him when he was there like
A	yes
B	some of the prisoners
A	that's good
B	yeah
A	well it's good they've got someone to talk to who's not a member of the prison service because you can see it'd be very difficult in there
B	your dad was very good at talking to them like that
A	he would be yeah good listener
B	yeah that's right yeah he's always been interested in prisons hasn't he? since young as a young boy
A	he has yes
B	yeah
A	enjoyed that as a career actually could've worked his way up
A	that's right yes
B	yeah
A	yes
B	cos some of those chaps get paid quite well now don't they?
A	they do yeah you know it's a lady governor up at Dartmoor she's very good apparently
B	I think I think
A	yes unusual though still still a very male-dominated industry
B	yeah not surprised yeah
A	yes
B	well do they have lady prisoners in Dartmoor then?
A	no no so it's very unusual then they've put a woman in charge because there aren't any women there
B	yeah that's that's it
A	I suppose they can have prison guards who are women but still
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	does your dad go into the cells at all or not?
A	I don't know I'll have to ask him actually
B	yeah
A	I'm not sure yeah
B	yeah cos such a tiny space isn't it their they have in the cells?
A	yes and the they're only built for one but most of them have two
B	two
A	yes that's not right
B	no no yeah
A	and that was in Victorian days when standards weren't quite what they are today
B	well yes I know yes it's yeah
A	that's pretty bad doubling people up and they're locked up twenty-three hours a day most of them
B	what? even today do they?
A	don't have enough staff to let them exercise and things it's pretty bad
B	oh so they've gotta keep them in yeah
A	yes that's quite serious
B	I think not very long ago they had a bit of a riot there didn't they? not too far back
A	yes that's right they did yeah up on the rooves weren't they?
B	yeah
A	that's right quite dramatic
A	yes
B	he goes come and get me but they they tried to starve him down didn't they? so they gave him no food
A	yes that's right
B	cos your dad's always had an interest in prisons hasn't he?
A	he has yeah I wonder why that is
B	yeah
A	mm
B	well
A	yes that's right yes no that's nice
B	yeah I suppose now it's the same I suppose
A	yes
B	he was really he's he's well known in the prison isn't he your dad?
A	yes
A	yeah I know that's good
B	yeah
A	that's very good
B	I I seem to remember actually I think it's
A	oh right
B	you know in that
A	oh that's interesting mm
B	yes I think that's how he came in touch with those
A	yeah
B	cos they knew about
A	mm
A	oh right
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B doesn't really know how they know	Contradiction
A	yeah mm
B	talking about
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A agrees with speaker B	Entailment
A	mm
B	prisons and so forth
A	yes no it's good
B	yeah
A	I suppose he took early retirement though didn't he? so
B	oh I I suppose he was very early retirement
A	he was lucky he did well he was only about fifty
A	that's pretty good
B	yeah
A	cos he didn't start working until he was twenty-eight did he?
B	I don't know
A	not really cos he was out in Uganda
A	then he came back and then he trained as a teacher when he came back I think
B	yeah
A	and then he worked in an accountancy firm for a year in
[ANNOTATION]	He worked in an accountancy company for 3 years	Contradiction
B	yeah wasn't his line accountant was it?
A	wasn't his thing so then he went into teaching after that so it was quite late
B	yeah I suppose it was late yeah
[ANNOTATION]	He didn't really enjoy teaching	Entailment
A	he did very well
B	yeah
A	must've saved
B	I think
A	er that's right yes they met in
A	yes
B	and he had the worst your dad had the worst part
A	yes
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A's dad didn't have a very enjoyable part	Entailment
B	Uganda cos that was bad very bad
A	yes mum was meant to go to Uganda and she just had a bad feeling about it and told them she wouldn't go in the end
B	oh oh did she?
A	and they sent her to Kenya yes but she did the right thing
B	oh
A	she wouldn't've coped in Uganda
B	yeah cos we visited your mum when she was in Kenya
A	yes yeah she liked it there
B	yeah I know and she
A	oh right mm
B	forgotten his name now
A	oh right mm
A	and how did you meet grandma?
B	how I first met grandma? that's a good question
A	you would've both been in
B	yes how did I meet her?
A	oh right mm
B	oh she'd take me to oh she'd take me to the local dances
A	mm
B	cos she danced and I didn't
A	oh right
A	yeah oh that's nice
B	she used to like dancing but of course er oh she gave me I had lessons then afterwards
A	oh that's nice
B	people used to come to the house
A	yeah
B	and give me lessons
B	but I was never any good I trod on people's toes and I gave it up
B	but er your grandma yes your grandma used to love dancing
A	yeah
B	who else in the family did dancing? oh it's erm
A	oh
A	yeah
B	she used to do dancing
A	that's right she did yes
B	er yeah she used to do we watched er she was on
A	oh right
B	high kicking
A	oh
A	mm
A	we're going next week aren't we?
B	beg your pardon? oh I know yeah
A	next Friday
B	you've not been to
A	only well to the pantomime years ago with you Christmas pantomime you took us all
B	oh oh so you have been there then yeah
A	yes
B	yeah I'd forgotten it was was that when we took
A	we took
B	oh you were there at that time were you?
A	yes Rolf Harris was one of the lead characters
B	oh
A	and
B	I know
A	and he drew him a picture didn't he?
B	yeah
A	but
B	could've could've been yeah
A	worth a fortune but that was before he got in trouble of course
B	yeah
A	yes
B	oh yes he got into
A	he's gonna be
B	he went to jail for some years didn't he?
A	that's right and I think he's just had his prison sentence extended when they found other things
B	oh has he?
A	he'll die there I would've thought
B	oh so he's got a
A	yeah amazing really they got away with it all that time isn't it?
B	yes well people don't didn't complain I suppose
A	no
B	when someone starts complaining it brings other people in
A	well apparently
B	yeah that's terrible really
A	it's outrageous isn't it?
B	yes that's right I mean the nurses
A	and they would've been worried about losing their jobs so
B	I suppose something like that yeah all all powerful
A	and just that's right yes
B	and he er yes he was was a paedophile wasn't he Savile?
A	that's right there was one at the Japanese embassy when I worked there
B	there was what?
A	one at the Japanese embassy I worked with
B	was there?
A	you know they've got diplomatic immunity so was nothing anyone could do
B	no no no
A	that's terrible though
B	that's where you were working were you?
A	yeah
B	oh working
B	oh that's terrible isn't it really?
A	yes but they got away with it even if you told the police the British police can't do anything to them
B	oh
A	cos they've got immunity can't arrest them
B	oh oh oh that's no good
A	they probably complained to the Japanese government but
A	at worst all they're gonna do is move them back to Japan
B	oh
B	why not?
A	cos all diplomats have diplomatic immunity
B	oh was it diplomats was it?
A	yes
B	oh I see yeah
A	so they can't touch them which is why they get away with it might be a bit cold grandpa I'll make you another one if you want
B	oh no it's I
B	yeah I mean it's even worse when it's in schools
A	yes but probably very common cos that's where they'll end up working isn't it?
B	you don't er yeah
A	and you can put all the police checks you want but the fact is it's all online nowadays and
B	yeah
A	that's pretty difficult to police
B	yeah I suppose it is yeah
A	so they'll be getting away with it
B	I remember
A	yeah?
B	and so what what was she? oh she must've been telling somebody off or something like that one of the children something like that
A	yes
B	and the father turned up next day and said you talk like that to my young son again and I'll be after you and he rolled up his sleeves
A	oh dear
A	scary isn't it?
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	and a lot of the time the schools just brush it off because they don't want the paperwork
B	no no yes
A	and the you know that sort of thing with the police in it always looks bad on the school
B	oh yes
A	so they're not protecting the the teachers
A	that's right and they need to I mean that's that's a criminal offence threatening a a teacher like that or threatening anyone for that matter
B	cos I remember my young days at school headmaster he always carried a cane
B	er yeah
A	it's for when the angry fathers came in
B	yeah well that's they they used to carry it around with them
B	children always used to get the stick
B	it was abandoned though wasn't it? it was
A	yes that was stopped yes
B	I know it's a regular thing
B	probably didn't do anybody any harm I suppose
A	well don't know they might've grown up violent themselves
B	well I suppose
A	that I think that's the danger with it isn't it? that
A	if you give the message particularly to young boys
B	yeah
A	that violence is a good way to solve problems then
B	yeah
A	they might go home and beat up their wife when they're older so
A	I think from I think from a psychological point of view it can do a lot of damage
B	damage yeah
A	that they
B	yeah
A	the the weaker one which is probably the woman in the relationship
B	yes it is yeah
A	so you don't wanna hear that
A	no
B	if
A	that's right
A	yes
B	yeah so of course it has changed a lot of course I remember
A	yes
B	in our younger days the ladies you went to a pub the ladies had to stay outside
A	yeah
B	even in my day like
A	although you still don't see women on their own in pubs which I think's interesting not because it's illegal but they just don't go on their own do they?
B	they don't go no no no
A	so we talk about equality and certainly in the law we have equality
B	yeah
A	there's nothing to stop me going to a pub on my own nobody does
B	no that's it
A	when do you ever see a woman on her own in a pub? but you see men go in for a pint all the time after work don't you? on their own
B	yeah
A	and they'll stand at the bar and they'll have their pint and then they'll leave
B	right
A	even going for a meal
B	I suppose not no
A	but it's the done thing for men that's perfectly okay
B	that's died away a bit now though I suppose you know ladies who go in together sometimes
A	yeah
B	I I
A	yes yes you see groups of women don't you?
B	I've seen I've seen seven or eight women sitting around the table
A	yes but not on their own
B	not on their own no
A	I think that's quite interesting so we're a long way off socially social equality I think
B	yeah
A	we may be there in the eyes of the law
B	yeah
A	but social equality isn't there and it's not men stopping women it's
B	well I certainly in my day with the ladies yeah they they always stood outside
A	yes
B	they never went inside the pub
A	no
B	the men would bring the glass of something out for them like
A	oh right
B	yeah cos I suppose now of course you often get more meals in a pub than you used to get
A	that's right it's different it's moved away from alcohol like today we were in a pub
B	yeah yeah
A	and probably no one was drinking were they?
B	eating yeah
A	I mean we looking at the tables around us
B	yeah
A	those young boys had a pint
B	yeah
A	but they were pretty young they were only about twenty weren't they when we first came in?
B	yeah yeah
A	but the other table that had they had fruit juice and the table behind us later on they had water
B	yeah
A	and we had water whereas in days gone by you didn't go to a pub and order water
B	no no
A	that would've been really frowned upon if you went in and said I'll have two glasses of water please
B	no
A	and now that's the norm and food is the the main business
B	yeah I remember in
A	oh right
B	yeah
A	yes and
A	when grandpa was growing up
A	he said there was no alcohol in his house
B	oh was it? oh
A	but he had uncles he had an uncle who used to make his own homemade
B	yeah yeah
A	you know the really traditional not grapes cos they didn't have
A	yes but erm my grandfather was only about eighteen and he'd never drunk before
B	oh yeah
A	and he got offered in this relative's house a glass of rhubarb wine and so he drank it having never had alcohol before and you can imagine
B	oh no
A	he was not well afterwards
B	oh dear
B	actually he had not all that long time ago when we came here even forty years ago I suppose now something like that
A	oh that's nice
B	well
A	yes
B	and he stopped it he er stopped dad
B	dug in got him a mug there try one of these Mr
A	oh dear
B	I didn't drink any of it yeah
A	the local cider though a lot of farms in
B	yeah yeah
A	you know not quite round here but a bit further down they do cider still don't they? on the farm and they sell it off
B	oh yes yeah
A	it's quite nice it's not bad
B	it's him actually used to do er you know
A	yes
B	he did one for ciders
A	oh right oh that's nice it's good fun
A	yes
B	I've forgotten
B	who he did it with but he oh on his own he would come here five years ago
A	yes that's right he did very well didn't he?
B	yeah yeah yeah he did well and he sold it on well at the right time actually
A	yes yeah he did well he did
B	yeah really
A	very good
B	yeah that's right yeah
A	good head for business the
B	oh
A	and better working for themselves I think the
A	because you've you know ran your own business
B	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	has worked for other people but she was always peripatetic so she never really had a boss did she? she went round all these schools
B	not really not really
A	but I mean really you're autonomous in that job
B	yeah
A	you don't see your boss you might see them once a term for a meeting
B	no no
A	but you're very much expected to manage yourself
B	yes
A	and
B	yeah
A	and
B	I I suppose yeah
A	worked for a school for a long time
B	yeah
A	but didn't really like it and erm
B	yeah
A	taught she did her own teaching didn't she? from home
B	in fact now I think when he's been back in Bahrain recently she's taken on a few pupils
A	yeah so she's running her own business again
B	yeah yeah no as well yeah
A	yes so it's quite interesting
B	she's still doing it yeah
A	yes
B	and I I think she gets paid quite well for it
A	oh I imagine she does
B	these you know these
A	yeah
A	yeah I know that's right
B	and you you make some nice little occupation out of it
A	yes that's a good idea
B	it's also something to do when she's been over in Bahrain
A	yes I think you need something don't you?
B	yeah yeah
A	yes it'd be boring otherwise and it's not like she's new out there so she hasn't got
B	well she knows the language
A	yes but also that she can't go and explore places
B	no
A	new so she needs
B	I know
A	mm
B	cos
B	in
A	yeah
B	and you used to get
A	dear
A	yeah I bet she did
B	cos if you do anything wrong I am the one who has to go to jail for letting you do it
A	well that's probably true actually yes
A	that's right it's the husbands they'd arrest
B	I think times have changed now I suppose they may just although I know when we were there somewhere
A	mm
B	and the lady came in dressed in all those Arabic clothes
A	oh really?
B	yeah and then in no time er when she wasn't got into the hotel like she went off and changed
B	came down in all the local
A	she was probably a Saudi lady
A	away for the weekend cos you probably wouldn't get away with that if you lived in Bahrain cos everyone would know you
B	no no that's right
A	so then you know people would speak badly of you so I bet she was a Saudi lady
B	oh yes suddenly she came down dressed as a like a New Yorker almost you might say
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah
A	that's right we used to see Saudi girls sometimes in the UAE they would dress Western
B	yes Western yeah
A	erm but you could tell they were always quite badly behaved actually
B	oh were they?
A	it was quite surprising yes it's cos they were away from their families
B	oh yes families yeah
A	yes
B	oh yeah
A	quite funny
B	cos I suppose in Saudi it's still pretty strong there
A	yeah very repressive
B	repressive on the the ladies yeah
A	yes yes that's right
B	cos I think when when we've been when
A	mm
B	the ladies I mean
A	mm?
B	otherwise he was saying yes he goes to jail for letting me do it like
A	mm yeah it's true
B	yeah but that's died away now hasn't it?
A	no no still going strong out there
B	is it? towards the ladies?
A	it's very repressive
B	oh
A	they've got the vote for the first time
B	yeah
A	that's about it that's the
B	yeah
A	but they can't drive still that's pretty restrictive
B	can't drive still?
A	yeah can't travel without a male
B	is that just Saudi is it?
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes
B	Bahrain was okay was it?
A	oh yes Bahrain's fine yes
B	oh yes I thought yes
A	it's only Saudi yeah so
B	yeah
B	cos she yeah it's funny isn't it? cos I mean all those Saudi kings and queens they like coming to have a chat with the royalty over here don't they?
A	yes
B	mm well
A	well I think the royal family the least the leaders of the royal family are quite progressive but the problem is they can't impose change because the
B	yeah
A	the sheiks and erm well particularly the religious leaders are very strong and powerful so if they try to force through change then there might be an uprising
B	be trouble yeah
A	and that's what they're worried about it was not that they're opposed to change in fact it was the late king who died last year who pushed through the the voting reform for women before he died and that's kind of his legacy
B	oh
A	but it's been very slow the change
B	oh so everyone's happier now are do they or don't they vote?
A	it is I don't know how much power I mean it's not like voting for the government here where that actually brings about change I mean these are
B	oh
A	although women can stand for office which is interesting that's new too
B	oh well I think recently oh no that's
A	mm it's not Japan
B	or one of those other ones
A	yes Japan's quite restrictive like that
B	it's a
A	oh I don't know
B	can't think of her name now
A	mm
B	I remember when we I remember when we went to China by ourselves years ago
A	yeah
B	and you were not welcome like
A	oh right
B	they didn't want you there
A	dear
B	so nobody went
A	yes
B	and when we went we were some of the first to go after all those
A	oh that's interesting yes
B	and in no time
A	oh right
B	cos they it'd been banned before
A	yeah interesting
B	and I
A	yes well yeah I'm not surprised
B	and it frightened her and I had to pull her out and say no go away
B	yeah yeah no no no no
B	did you travel much to China when you were there?
A	I saw
B	oh Shanghai you went to? yeah
A	mm that was nice
B	very good oh Shanghai's okay yeah
A	yeah
B	I remember going there yeah Shanghai
A	yes you went a few times didn't you to China?
B	oh yes oh went several bits over there yeah several times
A	two or three times yes it must've changed a lot
B	in fact we did that big trip actually when we flew to Moscow
A	mm
B	what did we do? we flew to Moscow went right went right across northern Russia and nosedived south into er
A	yeah that rings a bell actually yeah
B	Ulan Bator on the borderline somewhere
A	oh right
B	and then you you go into there then into China from there like
A	yes it sounds like that mm
A	mm
B	or did we? did we did we meet up over there?
A	no no
B	no no
A	was she out there?
B	well she had a friend out there
A	ah right
B	and so she gave us a letter of introduction and the lady out there she she knew was er in charge of all the sisters out there
A	oh right oh that was good
B	and so and much to the annoyance of the girl the lady in question was we had this introduction to this lady who was the boss she'd retired more or less but she was still the boss there actually
A	yeah
B	and she gave us the the car the erm the sisters use they only had one car and she gave it to us to use for the week
A	aw
B	so they were she she was horrified that they couldn't go anywhere cos we had the car like
A	that was nice
B	and she although she'd retired she was still the boss so to speak
A	yes
B	yeah oh what happened?
A	oh yes well I don't remember him but erm the name rings a bell
B	yes he ran a school like out there
A	cos he yes that's right he ran was it in China? he had I know he had some in India or well at least one in India
A	cos
B	I don't think China I don't think it was
A	no
B	but he came to he came to England actually
A	yes
B	and yeah she couldn't stand him
A	yeah it's funny isn't it?
A	she can't've been very old
B	no he he looked pleasant enough to look at and talk to
A	it's funny isn't it?
B	and I took him round introduced him to various schools in
A	yeah
B	and er what did he say?
A	yeah
B	but he said if he went to a church there was a collection like
A	oh yes
B	so he had three times as much or five times as much
A	oh interesting
B	so yeah so and he and he stayed with us a few nights and
A	no it's funny isn't it?
B	yeah yeah she wouldn't didn't go go anywhere near him
A	yeah
B	and
A	yeah
B	probably right I suppose in one way
A	yes that's right I think later on there was
B	oh
A	a question mark about him wasn't there?
B	yeah there was some
A	he got investigated
B	yeah there was
A	I don't
B	no but there was obviously things against him and and
A	yes
B	there was
A	that's right but she obviously
B	suppose he was think
A	but she obviously got a sense didn't she somehow? or
B	yeah she she she somehow felt that he didn't want to he wouldn't talk she used to go out of the room when he came in
A	yeah that's quite unusual for
A	I can imagine she was quite a chatty girl
B	yeah but when he came in
A	she would leave yeah
B	she just hated the sight of him and she'd just walk out
A	it's funny isn't it?
B	erm yeah and he used to comment to me she doesn't seem to like me
A	yeah
B	no but as it turned out she was probably right about him
A	yes that's right yeah
B	yeah
B	I think I think
A	mm
B	I expect she I think she just took a natural dislike to him I don't know why
A	yeah I think it probably was quite instinctive on her part
B	I think so with
A	she's got a good
B	who who
A	yeah
B	if
A	oh that's very odd yeah
B	and I suppose being a girl she'd know better than most I suppose yeah
A	I don't know yes
B	yeah
A	yeah well there we are
B	I must say when we went
A	oh yeah that is lovely mm
A	lucky
B	yeah what did I used to do there?
A	yeah
B	and by going in the car you broke the shells and someone would come and pick them up
A	oh like a
B	yeah whatever it was was fall down
A	oh that's clever
B	yeah so that's used to happen there you
B	drive over these things you'd be breaking up something
A	oh
B	yeah
A	that's pretty useful
B	yeah it was useful for the locals
A	yeah
B	but oh yeah mum didn't like him at all I must say
B	well
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	that's funny
B	instinctively I suppose
A	yes
B	well she's
A	must've been Bahrain yeah
B	cos I remember
A	mm
B	he must've been part of the family part of the company I suppose
A	yes a lot of them have their own clubs
B	yeah I think so
B	and
B	he was he was the big chief of course of all those people
A	yeah
B	and there we are have him yelling our name out
B	yeah that's right
A	you were honoured
B	yes that's right
A	yes yes
B	yeah and you met
A	yeah I haven't seen him in years though
B	yeah he
A	not for a long time cos he didn't really settle back here did he? wasn't that happy I don't think
B	not not really no I mean
A	he needed the the workplace
B	he was
A	I mean a lot of men do I think don't they? they enjoy work
B	yeah
A	and when they retire it's actually very hard for them
B	well
A	no
B	since he was eighteen like
A	so he couldn't settle there probably either
B	no so he
A	in fact probably worse than the UK because it's not so multinational and he would've been used to a very multi-ethnic workplace
B	yeah well he was
A	oh right
B	and also bits in and in Bahrain of course as well
A	yes yes and I think that's even harder then to
B	yeah
A	settle when you come home
A	yes
B	and of course he's
A	that's right I expect he likes it
B	yeah and
A	yes it's only supposed to be a year but I bet they'll offer to keep him on actually
B	I think they asked him to do five years
A	oh did they?
B	and he said I'll only do one year and I'll think about it when I er when that's up
A	well that's sensible
B	so that's what he did then so er
A	yes
B	I don't I expect he'd want to come back I suppose yeah
A	I don't know
B	we don't know
A	I don't think he will actually
B	no
A	I I think he'll want to stay and
B	because
A	yeah I think that's more likely it would be
B	yeah
A	cos he's going to enjoy the company
B	yes it it's true when he was at home of course he was always the big boss everywhere and gave instructions of course all that went
A	exactly I think that's very difficult
B	yeah yeah that would've been difficult for him I suppose
A	and then you're starting again with friendships aren't you?
B	yeah
A	so that's not easy
B	oddly enough
A	she met them again?
B	met met them there now she's gone back again recently
A	oh that's nice
B	she met up with people she knew years ago
A	oh that's lovely
B	they were still around
A	yeah yes that's nice for
B	yeah that's right
A	oh right
A	yes that's right
B	yeah
A	yeah they support their families a lot of them with like one salary might support ten people cos it'll go a lot further of course
A	yes
B	yeah
A	yes they were threatening in Oman to start taxing remittances
A	because that would be a huge source of income for the government
B	oh yeah
A	and you'd only target foreigners then because the
A	it wouldn't be the locals doing that
B	yeah
A	but it caused an outcry and they had to back down
B	back down did they? yeah
A	because
B	oh well
A	and they're not earning that much so
B	oh no
A	if you started taxing them
B	yeah
A	even if it was only one percent it would upset a lot of people
B	yeah cos in Bahrain at the moment
A	yes
B	it's the men in charge the ladies second
A	yes I suppose that's still true
B	it's the same in in parts of where
A	yeah it was very restrictive
B	yeah
A	but the UAE was quite
B	firm
A	strict
B	strict yeah
A	yes
B	yeah
A	women
B	oh
A	they didn't really work or if they did it was you know just for a year or so and then they'd get married and then that'd be the end of it
B	yeah I know in Bahrain it was a bit well I don't know about but it was or it used to be
A	yeah
B	you're in you're not in England now
A	mm
B	cos she used to tell them all you know police come up and tell her that's not the way to dress to wear one of them might say she
A	yeah
B	so yeah
A	it's difficult yeah
B	yeah for
A	yes but then on the other hand men don't have many restrictions on them so
B	yeah
A	he wouldn't realise what it's like to be on the receiving end
B	receiving end no
A	because as a man he could do pretty much
B	what you like
A	what he wanted
B	yeah
A	so he didn't really understand how repressive that might be to be told now you have to do this you can't do this
B	I think for years it took some years before they allowed ladies to drive over there Saudi
A	mm
B	they still can't still now you say?
A	no no they're not allowed yeah in Bahrain they can
B	oh it's Bahrain they can yeah
A	yeah all over the Gulf they can it's just Saudi it's pretty bad isn't it?
B	sounds awful
A	so
B	oh
A	I mean they had drivers of course you know but still
B	well somebody drives you around yes
A	yes it's not the same is it?
B	no no cos we when we visit
A	oh yes
B	so he used
A	that's nice isn't it?
B	yeah he's just the boss in charge and he
A	yeah
B	had these cars at his command so to speak
A	yeah
B	and yes well he worked oh I suppose now he's gone back again
A	yes
B	he'll be the king chief again I suppose
A	expect he's enjoying that
B	well that's right I think er what's the neighbouring country?
A	er
B	I think they're they're they're
A	I'm not sure oh I need to plug this in it's dying a death alright I'll stop this
