B	oh did you see in the Metro
A	oh is there?
B	did you see it?
A	no
B	advertising tickets
A	it's sold out though I thought
B	really?
A	well I mean mine
B	are you going to that? Cos you've got a ticket haven't you
A	yeah
B	is that is it a crunch game or something? Cos West Ham can't
A	well it would've been
B	get automatic
A	I I I think if they probably if they win every game and and Reading and Southampton don't
B	ah
A	it
A	I want them to suffer
B	before they go in
A	yeah
B	my cousin  my cousin  er friend's cousin plays for Reading
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	doesn't he
B	um
A	huh
B	Cos they're gonna
A	yeah
B	oh yeah
A	they were singing to the the who were they playing? Who were they playing? Birmingham fans
A	two one up against Reading
B	it's pot calling kettle black
A	yeah exactly
B	Cos you oh you went to that game as well?
A	mm
B	oh yeah
A	one nil up
B	mm
A	and then they went two one down in the space of two minutes
B	look how they've advertised it
A	yeah
B	push for a promotion
A	no I mean
B	oh no
A	playoff places
B	the fourth position
A	so they're  so they're  trying to sort of
B	are we
A	they lost last night
B	I always think it's unfair when the teams in the playoffs
A	mm
B	third place team is Wrexham
A	uh-huh
B	and they've got ninety points
A	oh okay
B	first team qualifies automatically
A	mm
B	they've got a hundred and one points
A	right
B	Wrexham was second
A	mhm
B	at ninety points during the play-offs
A	okay
B	and the two teams below them have got seventy-one
A	mm
B	so Wrexham could go into the play-offs with a team that are twenty points behind them
A	and lose
B	ah
A	mm
B	it doesn't seem fair does it
A	not really
B	yeah
A	but then again you know with something someone like West Ham it is
A	because they they've been arseholes
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and Crawley have gone playing in the first division now
A	yeah
B	they came up with the gold
A	have they? Crawley?
B	which they're not saying who where it's come from
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	are they not?
B	no
B	three one
B	my friend
B	oh the shame of it  the shame of it
B	Essex isn't it
A	mm
A	mm
B	I think it's just outside Dagenham isn't it?
A	oh
B	probably corrupted
A	mm
B	Brian's tree
A	Brian's tree down in Essex
A	mm
B	you've demolished it haven't you
A	I have
B	I do like this savoury pancake though
A	so where did you have your cake? Your
B	in the cafe downstairs
A	oh I see
B	in the baby
B	when I bought the um chair
B	I thought oh it's half
A	Good on you
B	yeah
B	I don't mind having two two lunches
A	two lunches
B	yeah
B	I if it's savoury it's okay
A	how's the um weight going?
B	the little men?
A	no the weight
B	oh yeah
A	mhm
B	with my dad
A	oh yeah
B	I'm his pacemaker
A	right
B	because he um he only runs faster when he runs with me he says so
A	oh okay
B	I helped him break his record by two and a quarter minutes
A	mm well that's good
B	because he was rushing to catch up with me
B	about seven kilometres
A	mm
B	but we um might be do what they've got these park runs now
B	A lot of um volunteers organize these park runs
A	mm
B	you just turn up on a Saturday at nine o'clock
A	mm
B	barcode
A	mm
B	and they scan it at the finish
A	oh
B	you just have to turn up with little
A	oh brilliant
B	it's just run by volunteers
A	every week or?
B	you could do it every Saturday if you wanted
A	at er different parks
B	yeah
A	you got them in
B	we're gonna find
B	you can lick the plate
B	but um
A	right yeah
A	right
B	mm
A	yum yum yum
B	well that was  that was  quickly eaten
A	yeah
B	mm
B	I really liked that
A	yeah
B	I bet you most if you went round and asked I bet most people here will be teachers
A	yeah
B	or
A	lecturers
B	oh yeah
A	mm
B	oh yeah
A	living it up
B	in her gte?
A	yeah
B	you're joking
A	yeah
B	oh no quarantine
A	quarantine
B	really?
A	yeah
B	I'm surprised at that because um coming coming back the other way into Britain
A	so yeah
B	mm
A	that can be picked up
B	oh
A	and as long as you have a certificate you can bring it back
B	oh that's good
A	and bring them back
B	ah
A	Cos there was talk about like pet passports
B	mm
A	that's obviously a bit  a bit  bit silly isn't it
B	imagine trying to tell the difference between tabby cats
B	wah
A	or getting them to take a photograph
A	more than two seconds
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	mm
A	she's over there till I don't know when
B	it's only a two week break isn't it
A	mm
B	oh good yeah
A	yeah
B	yet today and yesterday
A	yeah
B	it should've been raining but
A	no it's been
B	beautiful
A	it's held out hasn't it
B	yeah
A	yeah cos we had quite a lot of rain on Sunday didn't we
B	yeah
A	Monday?
B	the garden needs it though
A	yeah
B	you didn't sit out in your
A	no
B	in the garden
A	no
B	oh yeah
A	and
B	aha
A	well yeah
B	no
A	and sort of like oh I'll just have half an hour here and half an hour there
B	but do you have like a stream of consciousness and then you go back and edit it? Or
A	I
B	do you ever
A	um I'm beginning to start to do that
B	cut and paste and change it?
A	well yeah and I think that's a cos I tend to to sort of sit down and try and do it in my head
B	mm
A	Cos it it
B	yeah
A	it's impossible to say it
B	you need to have more clauses
A	exactly
B	in your writing
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	right
B	that's an interesting um
A	it is  it is  Yeah
B	mm
A	as well and
B	mm
A	that you'd never probably
B	and you can focus on your train of thought and so can the reader
A	I
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	it's different from a spoken
A	yeah
B	lecture isn't it
A	mm
B	or or yeah
A	yeah
B	I mean who isn't interested in how
A	mm
B	doing them a long time
A	mm
B	so they don't need notes anymore
A	yeah yeah
B	do it don't they
A	yeah yeah
B	and
B	Cos you've seen them quite a few years
A	yeah yeah
B	haven't you
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	and it's the same
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	same presentation
A	pretty much the same
B	just add some more up to date anecdotes maybe yeah
A	I suppose
B	that's good
A	yeah I suppose
B	Cos that's your skill
A	yeah
B	and you're ready
A	mm
B	once you can
A	which it's probably not
B	yeah
A	in the world of sociolinguistics
B	no
A	is it
B	they earn their money in the marking probably don't they
A	yeah
B	in the
A	yeah
B	after a while
A	oh yes
B	no
A	right
B	or B doesn't need me anymore
A	mm
B	and is doing well
A	or C
A	they haven't got
B	that's true
B	or D yeah or yeah A or going back to A
B	and she got really poor marks and thought what the hell did I pay that for? No I think it was alright really
A	mm
B	she was a bit all over the not all over the place she had some good ideas but she didn't know how to simply yeah simply structure it
A	and that's funny because she did two courses at BLS
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	bit kind of like say one thing and
B	yeah
A	think another
B	yeah
A	but but but was she
B	not wanting to offend and yeah
A	yeah
B	like taking advice but done something
A	yeah
B	Cos I wonder if she
A	I think she did appreciate you though
B	yeah she did
A	oh okay
B	she said
A	okay
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	the whole point of an MA is to explore your analyze
A	yeah yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	and like
A	not really
B	but why would it makes you realize doesn't it
A	I suppose
B	we weren't prepared to think outside the box
A	no
B	were we
A	but then I suppose if they come from backgrounds er where education does provide the answers then
B	mm
A	then that's what they
B	well yeah
A	mm
B	Greece is quite
A	I would imagine
B	which is bizarre
A	mm
B	greek philosophy
A	yeah
B	you'd think it would be
A	mm
B	filtered down through education
A	dunno
B	but know
A	no
B	Cos I bumped into her on the bus stop
A	yeah
B	she look she looked really fed up
A	right
B	she said she can't she said everything was dodgy about the schools she said
A	yeah
B	dark moody difficult
A	yeah
B	maybe Serbians are like that
A	yeah that's what I used to quite like about her actually you know
A	she she was very cynical about the language
B	mm
A	you know
B	yeah
A	mm
B	er um mm
A	oh okay
B	schools that do every yeah yeah
A	okay
B	and nothing
A	yeah
B	we do secretarial
B	computer
B	english and physics
A	we can do it
B	oh no
A	yeah
B	it was funny though cos the guy who ran the place
A	uh-huh
B	did
A	yeah
B	business-driven sort of guy
A	they closed down didn't they?
B	well yeah
B	well no he actually he's now a school in er
A	ah
B	so to give him credit they have gone on and made themselves quite a nice little school there
A	okay
B	but the the school they were sharing with was more dodgy
B	which closed and
A	there's always a dodgy git behind it isn't there
B	oh yeah
A	have they?
B	so you so the students can't work twenty hours a week now
A	at all?
B	no
A	mm
B	up until last year
A	higher education
B	not in the language
A	yeah
B	see that's why I think a lot of places got less longer-term people
A	yeah
B	Cos in that school in London
A	mm
B	we had Koreans who came for like a year
A	absolutely
B	now they won't because they can't work
A	that was the thing wasn't it
B	you know have a year work and study
A	mm
B	and tours and
A	yeah
B	thing to to do
A	yeah
B	but that's been closed
A	but then again you know er so many students just came through it to do the work and not the study
B	oh yeah
A	as a way of getting your feet
B	that's true
A	in the country and then disappearing
B	yeah
A	which is mm
B	well yeah
A	mm
B	people abused the system didn't they
A	absolutely
B	yeah
A	were
B	oh yeah
A	school owners particularly
B	mm mm mm mm
A	to be honest with you
B	mm mm mm
A	I wonder so
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	maybe we should go into a school and do some
B	about um oo I've I've forgotten now
A	yeah
B	that didn't last long did it
B	no
A	go
B	but I think I I can't remember if I read the article in The Observer
A	yeah yeah
B	extrovert bias towards extroverts
A	oh right
B	I think it
A	Cos
A	Cos I cos
A	it it would be quite interesting wouldn't it just to to observe you know how teachers respond to
B	mm
A	more vulnerable
A	what? Extrovert in terms of the
B	extrovert in term teachers and the students
A	I
A	no
B	the the the book reviews that we did
A	yeah
B	type activities
A	right
B	whereas the
A	well yeah
B	mm
A	you know again that that students have to be doing stuff
B	right
A	with other students
B	yeah
A	you know the
B	that would be classed as extrovert
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	Cos introvert would be like working alone
A	right
B	book project or
A	yeah
B	um any sort of research
A	no they don't do they
B	it is  it is  biased towards communicative stroke extrovert
A	but then old what did old
B	really?
A	they may as well
B	ah
A	kind of like an attitude that you know when they come to the classroom they should be doing speaking activities
B	do they think that's what they paid for?
A	Cos that's what
B	but to be fair that a lot of students do
A	but have you
B	feel that don't they
A	yes
B	oh right
A	do you get pieces back?
B	oh yeah
A	you know it it just depends what they're there for isn't it
B	it's an exam preparation course
A	well exactly
B	mm
A	is that you know well why are the students here? If they're here to do pieces of academic writing then that's what you wanna be doing in class
B	yeah
A	but um of course
B	well yeah
A	mm
B	no it's true  it's true  Cos yeah generally this is more yeah whimsical isn't it
A	mm
A	mm
B	it is though
A	it is  it is it is  I mean I yeah and and as far as like the
B	yeah
B	mm
A	of people
B	oh no
A	well yeah just beacuse I'm shy and I don't like acting the idiot and clowning around
B	doesn't mean you're gonna be a bad teacher
A	doesn't doesn't mean yeah
B	but no that was definitely I remember quite a few characters in my
A	mm
B	and they were the sorts who could sort of like um who wanted to teach their students Bohemian Rhapsody
A	yeah
B	and all that sort of stuff and
B	who cares?
A	for what purpose?
B	I don't know
B	I mean imagine that
A	no but yes
B	imagine that
B	I mean they must  they must  think it absolutely bonkers wouldn't they
A	and let's concept check Galileo
B	oh God
B	but yeah
A	oh absolutely
B	fun
A	student interaction
A	and at the end of it they were able to sing
B	it's funny you said er to mention Bohemian Rhapsody cos of the
A	did they?
B	yeah
A	bohemian Rhapsody?
B	mm
A	and these were mainly Korean students?
B	on the course
A	who must have really enjoyed that
A	being made told to make a complete tit out of themselves
A	your Mandarin class
B	it would be
A	there was one girl
B	no I want to know how to buy stamps in the post office
A	yeah
B	for example
A	no you're gonna sing Bohemian Rhapsody
A	teacher there
B	oh
A	cos he recorded them doing presentations and put them on YouTube without their permission
B	oh dear
A	they were  really angry about it
B	he should've asked their permission
A	he should have done really
B	it's so public
A	you know
B	but why did he put it on YouTube? It's not
A	I don't know  I don't know  I suppose he was English language teacher and he thought that'd be great
B	probably thought that was the fashionable thing to do and er
A	yeah
B	of course for them that's a very public loss of face
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	be anywhere near that kind of forum
B	how do you put videos on YouTube anyway?
A	I don't know
B	yeah
A	yeah yeah
B	I wouldn't put pictures of other people's kids up there
A	mm
A	no
B	but it's funny isn't it
A	yeah
B	and we're
A	yeah
B	but yeah
A	absolutely
B	some yeah it's for fun but
A	yeah
B	others it's like why are we doing
A	where do they get that from
B	well
A	thinking it's a
B	to to London
A	right
B	primarily to to London
A	so how is it sold to them? How do they?
B	I don't know
A	to London
A	right
B	they're taking a child to London for three weeks
A	mm
B	the teenagers of course it's more fun to be
A	mm
B	you know on the excursions isn't it
A	yeah
B	but the parents
A	yeah
B	then that that justifies the expense I think
A	do you know how much they pay?
B	or
A	but a lot or?
B	probably a fair amount
A	right
B	plus accommodation
A	okay
B	and travel
A	accommodation in a hostel?
B	host family
A	host family
B	and some of them were really bare minimum
A	that's another scam as well
B	I know
A	A host family
B	it's more like a lodger lodging
B	yeah
A	mm
B	you are part of the family
A	yeah
B	arrangement
A	get bed
B	yeah
B	nice introduction to English culture isn't it
A	yeah
A	and sing Bohemian Rhapsody
B	but it's ah yeah ridiculous
A	yeah
B	er I don't the agents I don't
A	right
B	quite trust you know
A	right
B	you never got a straight answer
A	mm
B	and cor
A	mm
B	and the agents didn't know
A	Cos I I suppose again
B	yeah
A	come to London
B	it's terrible
B	it's terrible
A	I don't know what they wanna learn
B	it was interesting getting an insight in that
A	mm
B	it's like
A	it is
B	oh yeah
A	you know outgoing people
B	activities
A	activity people and
B	that word activity it's so strange isn't it
A	yeah
B	what does it mean? Reading could be an activity
A	I suppose so
B	yeah
A	okay
A	yay
B	I felt like that oftentimes
A	yes
B	kids from the groups
A	which
B	yeah
A	ah
B	it doesn't matter
A	where are you going on holiday this year?
B	mm
A	just there?
B	er nowhere else
A	oh okay
B	yeah um by train
A	by train? Oo expensive
B	um yeah it wasn't too bad actually
A	you booked already?
B	number
A	oh
B	no
A	really? Oo how posh
A	from where?
B	from um
A	Waterloo
B	yeah
A	to Exeter?
B	Exeter Central
A	mhm
B	Cos if you book um quite a lot in advance it should be a lot cheaper
A	mm
B	Cos how do you go down to Devon usually?
A	I haven't been for ages
B	ah
A	yeah
B	you don't get the coach?
A	no because my sister now lives in
B	oh right
A	and it's a real troublesome journey because you have to go to
B	mm
A	it takes like six or seven hours so
B	that's the problem with
A	no
B	or buses
A	no
B	mm
A	I don't know
B	it's tough isn't it really
B	get away from
A	away from
B	oh right
A	so I haven't got to think about
B	you went to Turkey though didn't you
A	I did go to Turkey yeah
B	how did you like it?
A	I didn't really
A	like it
B	oh
B	why?
A	well because one
B	mm
A	we went
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A have been to turkey	Entailment
B	mm
A	but because it was a tourist part of Istanbul
B	Istanbul wasn't it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	and because it was
B	very touristy
A	very touristy
B	mm
A	they were celebrating Christmas more than we celebrate it here
B	really? mm
A	so all the shops had happy Christmas sprayed on it and
[ANNOTATION]	Christmas is banned in Turkey	Contradiction
A	you go into a bar
B	mm
A	so I don't like that
A	and then and so in the
B	too commercialized
A	too commercialized
B	mm
A	because you walk down the street and they everybody wants to sell you something
[ANNOTATION]	Istanbul has no tourists	Contradiction
B	mm
A	oh buy a carpet
A	give you a tour up the Bosphorus
B	did you go to the um well my last boss went to  went to  Turkey a lot
A	mhm
B	he went to the coast
[ANNOTATION]	turkey has a coastline	Entailment
A	okay
B	where there are lots of Roman ruins
A	ah
B	it's quite nice and quiet on the coast there
A	yeah
B	yeah he avoided Istanbul
A	yeah I think I I would advise anybody to
[ANNOTATION]	Istanbul is highly recommended	Contradiction
B	nice to visit there but probably off season
A	off season
B	mm
A	because er they would take you to the  to the  sort of the important landmarks
B	oh yeah
A	and you would
B	yeah
A	well I don't
B	yeah
A	it's probably best to go in a  in a  tour group
B	yeah
A	because someone
B	mm
A	they don't have that same kind of window shopping
B	yeah
A	culture that we have here
B	and you're obviously tourists so
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	I think that happens anywhere now
A	mm
B	Cos most
A	true
B	quite commercial I think
A	yeah
B	I can't remember
A	mm
B	opposite Cyprus
A	oh
B	that way
A	I've heard of Antalya
B	yeah
A	seems to be where a lot of people go
B	somewhere yeah
A	right
A	mm
B	but I've never been
A	really?
B	apart from nowhere
A	I've never been to the Mediterranean
B	any country
A	yeah but
B	Mediterranean
A	I've never really gone to the sea
B	oh right
A	I'm not a sea sort of I don't know
B	mm
A	get too restless
A	mm
B	should be enough
