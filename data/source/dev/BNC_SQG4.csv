A	so what's your concern with him starting nursery then? you're wanting er some sort of routine?
B	well not a routine only that he'll fall asleep by himself
A	that's unlikely that's gonna happen
B	mm
A	well you never did it
B	yeah
A	even as a toddler
B	what always had to be held?
A	or have one of us
A	one of us lying down with you in bed
B	mm
A	to get you to sleep at night
B	I know
A	and the end of the day and of course it's gonna be a different surrounding and it's only gonna be now and again and
B	uhu
A	he might not have a nap at he might just stay er end up staying awake all morning
B	yeah
A	cos he's only gonna have half days there isn't he?
B	I suppose
A	I mean at least when you start back September it's just those two half days
B	uhu yeah that'll
A	so
B	be easier yeah probably
A	so that that's that's not gonna be difficult is it?
B	hopefully not
A	oh well
B	mm
A	have you got him booked in for any sessions yet? or or just the two mornings like you're gonna carry on
B	he just well at the moment I've said the two mornings
A	Monday and
B	in July
A	Tuesday?
B	yeah
A	yeah that's okay
B	but I'll book him in for more you know it's not a
A	well it's not ideal is it? and if the weather's nice it'll be lovely to it would be better to have him wouldn't it? and
B	yeah but it's how much you can do obviously
A	yeah you're not gonna wanna put him in nursery any more really are you?
B	I will
A	are you gonna approach it with
B	I don't I want well
A	yeah it's about ten weeks away isn't it now? nine weeks?
B	yeah but it yeah it's like they they've obviously or he's made this offer but hasn't made any kind of I mean they did say obviously they'd have him in the evening or I'll have him on his birthday but they only kind of mentioned that on the morning
A	then they didn't want to come round on his birthday anyway
B	no didn't wanna come round
A	cos
B	yeah
A	if that happens
B	well exactly
A	does it all get called off does it?
B	yeah obviously so
A	they need to spend time with him and see if they think they can do it
B	well exactly
A	he's not a difficult baby but he's still a baby that needs
B	exactly yeah
A	constant
B	I don't think
A	don't you think?
B	they were babies no cos they had childminders and all sorts
A	oh right
B	cos of
A	mm
B	whatever she she used to take them to
A	yeah
B	I wouldn't see
A	mm
B	know what I mean? wouldn't
A	although he might turn out to be better than
B	yeah well wouldn't be difficult
A	no I don't think it would
B	mm it's yeah no I wouldn't think her having him would I wouldn't be comfortable with that either at the moment the way it stands
A	mm
B	cos they don't they don't if he starts crying it's like well obviously I'll give them a rough idea of what he does in the day by then
A	yeah
B	hopefully he'll have got himself into a pretty consistent one by seven months but dunno
A	mm er and it changes cos again if he gets
B	well exactly
A	a bit poorly or
B	yes starts teething mm
A	gets teeth coming through
B	exactly
A	and then once
B	oh yeah yeah
A	and now he's waking up again
B	uhu
A	that's just the nature of babies
B	mm
A	mm
B	I'd have
A	no you're gonna have to either well either get
B	mm
A	to him for a couple of hours now and again
B	yeah
A	beforehand and see how he
B	mm
A	feels and see how
B	yeah
A	but while you're on hand so he can phone you if he needs you
B	yeah
A	and see how that goes really
B	uhu
A	and give him our number as well
B	yeah
A	so when you're back at nursery and he's at work and he's
B	yeah
A	and it will you know hopefully July'll be fairly easy for me and your dad because well take this week he's he's working
B	yeah
A	erm I think Thursday Friday Saturday
B	okay
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about days of the week	Entailment
A	so he only does three full days and if if if he makes that Saturday and Sunday
B	yeah
A	does one full day in the week
B	mm
A	his parents but he can take
B	yeah take
A	erm
B	uhu
A	he's taking them out on Tuesday they're having lunch with their friends about
B	oh
A	forty miles away he's done it before it's a regular thing so he goes with them
B	oh really?
A	he says it's an hour to get there and an hour to get back so he may as well
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about a film	Contradiction
B	who are his who are his friends?
B	vaguely
A	is it
B	vaguely
A	and they meet about an hour away so he says well there's no point coming back
B	no
A	and I said
A	well I hope they pay for your lunch at least
B	mm
B	yeah as you say you can take him to
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	I know well I know it's I mean
B	complete schedule for the day isn't it? you you can't do what you want you can't
A	only for three weeks
B	mm
A	mm but at the same time you just think in nurseries I mean all the he'll be in a room with all the crying babies and they're all
B	yeah yeah
A	just left to
B	mm
A	and he won't come to any harm but you just
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about any harm or no	Neutral
B	no
[ANNOTATION]	person B said no	Entailment
A	kind of think oh
B	two mornings is
A	it's a bit of a shame but as he gets bigger and
B	yeah
A	a bit more
B	uhu yeah
A	you just think when they're that age they need one to one not
B	yeah they do
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
A	even one between two
B	no
A	babies and do they do that with all or is it?
B	they have like so they're in groups
A	mm
B	they have like a little group leader and I think they're responsible for about four of them so yeah it is
A	mm
A	it's just a dilemma isn't it?
B	yeah
A	that's why I just didn't go back
B	mm that's not an option
A	well we didn't we didn't have any money either but
B	yeah
A	it well we our house was about the size of yours and we stayed there until I got
B	uhu
A	and we needed another room
B	you did have three rooms
A	mm
B	upstairs didn't you?
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	it's difficult isn't it?
B	mm
A	cos you wouldn't go back out a choice I don't suppose no
B	no
A	mm
A	some people do some people want a job but the
B	some people are weird
A	well yeah
A	I never went back and you don't think that before you have them you think oh yeah I'll go back to work and
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	you've got no idea have you before you have one?
B	no
A	and of course you think everything's gonna be
B	mm
A	it's funny cos
B	oh yeah
A	was saying how she's already booked a holiday for next year
B	oh okay
A	abroad
B	mm
A	that she's taking the
B	okay
A	erm you know and I just thought well fine but it's like I said to you
B	yeah yeah
A	just hang on till you've had him and see
B	yeah
A	how you feel
B	uhu
A	cos I don't think you wanna be jetting off to
B	where's she going?
A	oh I don't know Spain or Fuerteventura or
B	oh okay
A	there I don't know
B	uhu
A	something like that
B	yeah but
A	yeah if they catch a cold or they get a bit ill while they're over there
B	yeah
A	you've got all that hassle you've got everything
B	yeah
A	that's what I was thinking about the Iceland trip cos
B	mm
A	that's not a place for a baby to spend a day out
B	no
A	he won't he won't want to
B	it is yeah
A	what if?
B	if anything happens then
A	if
B	mm
A	we're just miles from anywhere
B	mm
A	and all of that in my mind I don't know I probably worry too much anyway your dad always said I did
B	uhu
A	and you go oh yeah it'll be easy but er it would if if everything goes smoothly but
B	mm
A	the minute
B	yeah
A	that's right and play
B	move and play yeah
A	and like if you've got a swimming pool or you've got a
B	mm
A	would be fine
B	uhu
A	you know as long as we're watching him with all the steps but you've got
B	yes do what you wanna do and
A	you've got beaches you've got the apartment to go and sleep in
B	mm
A	with the air con you
B	uhu
A	we know what we've got
B	mm
A	erm
B	yeah yeah it's different
A	there are hospital facilities on the yeah you know might not be great
B	mm
A	but I'm sure
B	yeah it's different out there cos you know what to expect you know what
A	and I think with Spain and all the Spanish
B	oh yeah
A	I think you'd be erm
B	mm
A	when you were three and five
B	yeah yeah
A	erm and you were out and about in the tent cos
B	mm
A	she says was it wonderful? I said no you were a child
A	still camping and
B	yeah
A	the beds were still horrible I thought
B	yeah uhu
A	I did have a socket and a wooden floor and
A	a hard floor and and a
B	yeah
A	fridge full sized fridge
B	yeah
A	so it was quite good I said
B	mm
A	but only because the weather was good cos if you've got bad weather
B	mm
A	and you're all in there and you can't
B	yeah
A	dry anything it's horrible
B	it is yeah it's awful if you can't
A	but the weather was lovely
B	do anything and you can't go out
A	and the same when we went with
B	mm
A	and you had your swimming pool
B	yeah yeah well it's just
A	and that's what
B	yeah
A	and and while he's still this age I mean I there's no rush to take him abroad and I think going to
B	mm yeah yeah
A	because we know where we are we've got everything we need
B	yeah definitely mm
A	you can take him down the beach we can do the
B	uhu
A	there'll be like the little trampolines and things there'll be little crazy golf when he's
B	yeah
A	little fairground rides that's what you want when they're little
B	oh yeah yeah definitely mm
A	all the stuff that you used to do
B	and even if the weather isn't great then it's not an issue of
A	no that's right and we had some great
B	just gonna be
A	our caravan holidays were
B	yeah
A	were great and then you know you'd sit on the beach and then eat your little chips
B	yeah uhu
A	just put a blanket over you and put you in the shade and you'd be
B	mm
A	you'd lie there for an hour
B	uhu
A	wake up again oh we'll start playing again
B	mm
A	it's just easy
B	yeah
A	and let's face it the whole holiday revolves around the baby
B	oh of course yeah
A	well yeah if he's miserable then you may as well forget it
B	mm
A	what's the point of going anywhere?
B	yeah uhu
A	that's why you're not invited to New York cos it's no place to take a baby
B	where it's er
B	obviously where yeah if you've got Iceland and you've got the day booked or something and you've got the day at the Blue Lagoon and he wakes up and he's not very happy then it
A	well I just thought it's not an ideal place for him yet
A	and it is it's sightseeing because you'll be taking hikes to glaciers and waterfalls and beautiful things but that's not what a toddler wants to do
B	no no no
A	be bored stupid
B	uhu
A	and you'll just say well we'll get back or we'll then we'll only have the you know how many cars are we taking? it just I don't think it'll
B	yeah well you you you do something for your
A	yeah don't mention the number
B	mm
A	but that's gonna be Caribbean
B	yeah cos yeah
B	January yeah
A	that time of year
B	mm uhu
A	but that
B	yep
A	you know but and then I think well will I? no I probably won't
B	uhu
A	probably won't go anywhere for it
B	mm
A	yes of course have they mentioned this trip to?
B	no erm
B	we're booking dinner for eight o'clock at night or whatever
A	no
B	so
A	cos you won't fit into the schedule?
B	cos I'm thinking yeah
A	will it be Florida?
B	I don't know or whether it'll be like a villa in Portugal or something cos they have done that a couple of times
A	well that would work for you cos you could have a bit of freedom then and
B	yeah
A	with your own car and you haven't
B	yes
A	got to go out at eight at night although Portugal I don't think any of the restaurants open till seven thirty
B	yeah
A	but you were
B	oh yeah yeah
A	cos it was always a bit of a
B	mm
A	but you enjoyed it when you got there
B	yeah yeah
A	you loved the restaurants
B	yeah yeah
A	and you you
B	well
A	yeah yeah you just have erm mm yeah it's sleeping more in the day and
B	yeah
A	it's difficult to get
B	mm
A	a routine going without
B	a change
A	yeah
B	yeah definitely
A	mm
B	well we'll see but well we need to see if we're gonna be invited yet
A	well they say well you can come but we don't think it's your sort of thing
B	then I'm not gonna bother if they if they say that then
B	no I'm out just gonna go and check on him
A	he's asleep still?
B	uhu yeah well if they do
A	mm will it just be them and
B	I've no idea
A	mm
B	and also then
B	well mm
A	what time of year will they do it? is it?
B	probably will
A	their wedding anniversary's August as well as
B	uhu
A	so it's all around the same time?
B	well
A	which wedding anniversary is it then?
B	it's not for their anniversary
A	oh
B	thirty
A	yeah
B	or whether they'll go in like
A	depends where they go
B	mm
B	yes they do I suppose mm
A	it's probably be better weather for you cos it won't be baking hot
B	yeah
A	well I'm thinking about Canada a year September
B	oh are you?
A	yeah so you'll have to sort your childminding out I'm giving you notice now

A	mm
B	cooked him lots of different things and then one of them piped up I've forgotten who it was well I think I might just like cook er mine what I'm having cos and do like baby-led because it's gonna be like so much easier and I think it's a really good way of doing it
A	is that baby-led weaning they eat what you eat?
B	yeah mm
A	oh right
B	so I
A	baby-led
B	I text back
B	and I said oh erm yeah okay well you know good for you if it works for you but erm me and
B	fish and pizza or jacket potatoes
A	yeah
B	so really erm
A	yes
B	yes unless he wants frozen frozen oven chips
B	which he'd probably give them a go don't get me wrong
A	he would be fine wouldn't you? finger food
B	but not exactly
A	well everybody'll do it different er not everybody's keen on cooking anyway are they? so
B	no that yeah that's
A	and won't they a lot of them be buying food as well?
B	I think what did
B	I was like oh okay and I said well I don't pride myself in cooking fish but er
A	fish is easy stick it in the microwave
B	if there's a recipe yeah that's what did with the salmon yeah
A	any any any fish
B	I got it from I got it from Asda and they put it in a cooking packet for me
A	it's the best thing to
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about fish	Entailment
B	bit of salmon
A	it's the
B	whacked it in the microwave
A	best way to cook it as well
B	flaked it into his
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure can cooked good or not	Neutral
B	what was it? it was a erm
A	I'm doing salmon curry
B	it was cheese and
A	with tomatoes tonight

B	is it orange that's in that one as well? I put orange in a couple of them I can't remember
A	oh yeah you said yeah
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about party	Contradiction
A	yeah except well they should get the fish is the easiest thing to do
B	yeah
A	and it's so healthy and it's
B	yeah
A	and microwaving's the best way to cook it for them
B	yeah so er
A	isn't it
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about the best way for cook	Neutral
B	well you've got a bit of a a bit of cod and a bit of salmon
A	yes to eat with you
B	and then it's like yes to eat with you
A	yeah
B	but we don't eat at the same time so if he's having what I'm having
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about food	Entailment
A	yeah
B	that means in order for me to do it
A	yeah
B	economically as well I've gotta cook my tea at

A	have more kids by then as well and we always fed you
B	yeah

A	yeah
B	and whoever
A	Sunday lunches you always ate with us cos we just

A	a separate kind of veg without the er
B	yeah salt in
A	salt in yeah
B	that's what I'm gonna try and do for him like lunchtime and
A	yeah
B	you know if we when he's on sandwiches in a month's time or something I'm gonna sit down and I'll have a sandwich with him and I'll give him
A	yeah
B	the end of mine or something like that
A	but also they won't have the taste for a few years yet and they'll turn their nose up
B	exactly
A	children just do turn their nose up at stuff adults eat he might not want cheese and curries and
B	but no baby-led
A	oh

B	as long as he eats just
A	you just have to go with it
B	yes normal food
A	as long as he's eating yeah
B	exactly then
A	as long he's eating that's the main thing and not
B	exactly
A	kicking up a fuss
B	yeah
