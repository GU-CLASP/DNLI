D	mm
B	he said I want real ale drinkers in here
A	mm
B	he's got some lagers but they're very expensive imports
D	not all lagers are bad
B	no they're imports from America etcetera and they're usually hand produced
D	yeah
B	you know from micro-breweries cos that's what he does
A	mm
D	mm
B	no beer that he sells on the taps on the pump has travelled more than fifty miles
D	hmm
B	and all and he goes to see the breweries and he checks where they buy their barley and and all this sort of thing
D	mm
A	that's good that
B	and and he gives advice because he's a master brewer
D	yeah
B	and other breweries are always phoning him to come over and to check this recipe out and what do you think of this?

A	yeah we went there
D	yeah
A	but no we went to a different pub afterwards
B	not the
D	no
B	Down by Saint
A	oh no I'm gonna have to ask
D	I think we should just agree to disagree on this one
B	and then there's that's it there's not too many pubs around there
A	yeah well I don't know what your story is
D	no one where you were dancing
A	I don't remember two
D	two guitarists
A	no there wasn't any seats
D	there wasn't any seats?
B	mm
A	no we were standing
D	oh God
B	had you been drinking you two?
A	and and I said I'm sure this is the same pub we went to with your dad
D	and I said no it isn't and that's and that's the story really
A	and he said no it isn't
B	oh what
A	and I wanted to check with you
B	yeah
A	well I wanted to check with you to tell him that I was right you see
B	right but you got er you've got me all baffled now about this bloke that got his cock out
A	oh I what?
D	I can't believe you don't remember
A	what?
D	I think you must have been in the toilet
A	of course I would have remembered if that had happened
B	we er we saw a bloke in erm in
A	what?
B	yeah he was chasing people around the street
A	chasing people?
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I said you wanna have a word you know I said there's a guy down there red shirt
D	mm
B	ah
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	huh
A	funny
B	mm
D	there was some people in um since the revolution in Tunisia um there's a section of society that have
B	yeah
D	but now in er an area called La Marsa where a lot of the foreigners frequent the these like extremists have kind of going in and causing quite a lot of problems aren't they?
A	mm
D	and there was one girl who was wearing I don't know a skirt
A	shorts
D	shorts yeah shorts wasn't it?
A	mm
D	and someone just ran up to her and just pulled her shorts and her knickers down
A	she was just walking along the beach front
D	and in a really crowded like street
B	A protest
A	A symbol
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	something like you foreign sluts you know
A	A weird act of yeah
D	yeah it is weird
A	there was there was quite a few of those things happening
B	the this is why the this is the fear of Syria though isn't it? You know they say they there are so many factions and different outlooks of thing you know groups in Syria
A	there's um there's so many different outlooks
B	that if they overthrew the government now
D	mm
B	which one would the UN support?
D	hmm
A	mm
B	you know the because the cos if they overthrow the government they'll all be at each other's throats
D	it's difficult cos you've got Turkey right on their doorstep
B	yeah
D	and you've got really strong links with Iran as well so I mean this is like serious
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	it's not like not like the others
A	yeah
B	no
A	yeah
D	mm
B	you know so what are you doing? You're arming a civil war
D	mm
A	mm
D	yeah and then you've got China and Russia who are
B	couldn't care less in a way
D	yeah well they're disagreeing with what America is saying aren't they?
B	yeah
D	so that's just going to antagonise it as well
A	well no they
D	yeah
B	mm
A	which I dunno I don't know what would be best
D	yeah
B	yeah but that yeah because their arms flow stop
A	oh they are? Oh yeah but we did it with everybody
D	well it's like us and Libya then innit?
B	oh yeah oh yeah
A	we deal arms to to loads of people and don't admit it
D	oh God yeah
B	we sell them to anybody
D	it's where a big portion of our GDP comes from
B	mm
A	it's only cos our news want to say oh well that's because Russia is dealing with the arms that we know about it
D	mm
A	otherwise it'd be all secret
D	mm yeah
A	it is a mess
D	I was watching a documentary the other day about you know those you've got problems in Luton with the the EDP and the the extremists
B	yeah BMP is it?
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	and it was kind of looking at both sides of that
B	that's right yeah
D	it's like this extremist version that exists in England
B	yeah
A	oh
B	and that's why that's why they're in England because they wouldn't be tolerated in the countries they come from
A	yeah wasn't that weird that programme?
B	Cos we've taken the dross from the world
D	mm
B	they've come here because they can't practise what they preach in their own countries
D	I dunno
A	yeah because there are regulations on on extremism in the Muslim countries so that yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	yeah
A	it was where where is it?
D	that was in Luton
A	Luton
B	mm
A	and we couldn't believe it
D	no
A	well it's still difficult to believe
D	no it was
A	I I mean I almost need to go to Luton to see with my own eyes
D	but I mean the sad thing was that I was watching it kind of agreeing with the EDP on a lot of things
B	yeah yeah
D	and that's the scary thing
B	but I don't
A	and it doesn't
B	but I don't think they they you know because you're talking about racism in a way
A	yeah
B	erm you know not just this religious thing about Muslims in Luton
D	mm
B	racism or or Immigration because they're taking our jobs etcetera blah de blah de blah
D	mm
B	gripping by the throat
D	mm
B	so many foreigners are leaving these shores
A	are they?
B	they're going back home because they're saying they don't wanna live in this
A	well yeah it's gonna change again isn't it
B	there's nothing here for them anymore
D	yeah yeah
B	they you know?
A	yeah
B	the gravy train has long left
D	mm
A	mm
B	you know and they they've gotta go
A	no
B	where they used to have a back alley and all the garages at the back of them
D	oh the garages yeah yeah yeah
B	they've turned all the garages into houses
A	oh dear
D	mm
B	and but they've only they've only got the audacity to put bloody front windows and doors on the garages
D	mm
B	and put numbers on them
A	mm
D	yeah but how does that
A	it's the landlords that are not nice
B	because the landlord who owns the house
D	yeah?
B	is their own national
D	yeah yeah
B	he's a Pakistani and he's not looking after his own people he's exploiting them
A	yeah they're just money grabbers
D	yeah that's opportunism isn't it?
B	yeah and a lot of them were workers from Heathrow and they've lost their jobs because you know redundancies they're out of work
D	mm
B	and they're still having to pay this guy
A	yeah it's the it's the big landlords that are the problem
D	that's I mean that's not the race though is it? that's some people
A	it's yeah it's not
D	I mean you've got plenty of British people overseas doing er very nasty things as well
B	exactly well
A	yeah
B	but that's the racism angle though is it's not Britain that's doing these people down
D	mm
A	mm
D	yeah but it's
B	you know it's not just it's not just an English against them
D	no no
B	they can't look after themselves
D	mm
B	now that I dunno er
D	well it's if
A	well it's just evil people just just some some not nice people isn't it?
B	but it doesn't mean to say we're that we're not that clever at doing it ourselves cos we're you know Britons are quite good at stabbing each other in the back
A	yeah
D	I think if you're an illegal immigrant who's I mean on their own
B	mm
D	if they're escaping a war-torn country or if they get persecuted somewhere they they've got an opportunity to come here and reap benefits they wouldn't get anywhere else that's pretty
B	mm
D	well no you won't no they won't look after you if you're like that
A	well they they come to Britain
D	yeah so if they're an illegal immigrant I mean you're gonna gravitate towards people who are dealing in those kind of circles aren't you?
B	mm
D	and they're gonna be nasty people
B	yeah
A	well you have to
D	no you can't go to the state can you
A	so you end up paying lots of money to these outlaw
D	yeah well these
B	mm
A	what do you call those?
D	I don't know they're like mafia gang lords
A	like yeah gang lords
B	yeah
A	gang
D	yeah
B	there was the guy in Birmingham airport
A	mm
B	she er breezed straight through
D	mm
B	another guy had a scarf around his face cos it was cold walking from the plane into the terminal
D	mm
B	he had a scarf on
D	yeah
B	and he said what about her?
D	hmm
B	he says you've just seen the you know seen a slit in the front of her costume where you can just about see her eyes and she's breezed through
D	mm
B	and he was quite right in a way
D	well it's difficult isn't it?
B	but he got himself arrested
D	mm
A	it is difficult
B	yeah yeah
D	is the
A	mm
B	well common sense
D	mm
B	there should be common sense used in both
D	yeah there's not at the moment no
B	no but there's not
D	hmm
A	yeah
B	you know?
D	mm
A	it is difficult
D	mm
A	difficult ah on every level
D	I just hope people don't get I don't know too swept up with this media stuff
B	regarding what?
D	well regarding I don't know Islam
B	oh yeah
D	or
B	I think a lot of people do know that that you're always gonna get radical nutcases
A	yeah they do
D	work with them
D	yeah it's
A	yeah
B	so there's there's not like an inbred hatred of these people
D	no but it certainly gets encouraged though doesn't it
B	yeah when you yeah certain news stories do
D	well and policies
B	yeah
A	mm
D	mm
A	yeah I don't get that kind of thing
B	yeah
D	yeah and it's fuelling it
B	yeah
D	and they must I don't think like they're making these stupid policies by accident
A	mm
D	and making people more racist
B	mm
D	so there must be a reason they're doing this
A	well yeah mm cos my mum and dad had a similar thing to that
B	well it takes it keeps the eye off the ball
D	yeah
B	Cos you're you know it's like they started to expose the you know the er expenses scandals
A	mm
B	that's just the tip of the iceberg
A	yeah I know and they should all be in jail shouldn't they all those politicians
B	yeah
D	mm
B	and we'd be vilified in the press by what anti-social thieving scumbags we are
D	hmm
A	yeah
B	but because they're politicians they're getting away with it
D	mm
A	or the banker you know
B	all rewarding themselves
A	all of them
B	what other industry do you know where you can have absolute total failure
D	mm
B	and reward yourself handsomely for it
D	mm
B	it's ludicrous
D	yeah well that's not
B	no
D	I mean you say we live in a capitalist
B	go bust
D	that's the whole purpose of it
B	yeah
A	mm
D	and something that succeeds benefits and grows stronger
B	that's exactly what it is
A	yeah
D	yep
B	you give me a million pound rise this year and I'll give you one
D	mm yeah it's crony capitalism
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	well what are we gonna say to the newspapers when they say why has your company gone bust and you've gone cap in hand to the
D	mm
B	well if they were the best why did the company fail?
D	hmm
B	they should all be just sacked instantly
D	mm
B	you know
D	yeah
B	or if they're in public service like council  like council  leaders there's some certain council leaders like Essex paid vast sums of money
C	oi it's not Thursday
B	to jack their  jack their  bills up to cover their losses
D	Thursday?
A	what's Thursday?
D	is that Question Time is it?
B	yeah
D	you shout at the TV dad?
B	yeah
B	well yeah it's Thursday I can do that
D	well they are
B	and they don't have to abide by the rules of us
D	and they don't
B	yeah
B	senior police
D	hmm
B	you know they were the reports were bribing senior police officers
A	oh yes
D	mm
B	you know and that is there shouldn't be an inquiry
A	that bloke admitted it on the TV the other day
B	yeah
A	just on a chat show
B	and they're only just been paying
D	mm
B	take his car off him
D	mm
B	goodbye
D	yeah
B	here's your CV
D	yeah
B	not not step into another blimming high paid job your mate gives you
A	mm
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	mm
B	no but it won't happen will it
A	what won't happen?
B	well that sort of common sense thing
A	oh no
B	where where a failure or a cheat or a liar or a thief is exposed and kicked out
A	no they just
D	yeah
B	and his house and possessions are sold to repay the tax payers who he's been thieving off
D	yeah
B	but they'd do it to a drugs baron
D	oh yeah
A	yeah
B	they get somebody dealing with drugs and they'll take his house and his car and everything
D	mm
B	give him a knighthood probably
D	yeah
B	so it is a law for them and an a law for us
D	mm
B	so I'll park my car where I wanna park it
D	so what are you saying a means tested speeding ticket?
B	A means I think er means tested fines
D	right
A	oh
B	er not really
D	mm?
B	not really
D	mm
B	they know what people earn because they say they set your tax limits
A	that's true
D	isn't that a problem anyway having
A	yeah but it's all there already so
B	yeah but they've got it now with cars
A	I'm gonna go help
D	mm
B	and the police have got it linked up to their cars
D	mm
B	and
D	do you want another beer?
B	yeah go on then
D	Dawn? Dawn?
A	yeah?
D	would you be able to bring us a couple of beers please?
B	serve him wench
A	I don't know where the fridge is any more
A	I don't really know what to say to that when I'm holding your lovely Spitfires that I actually quite like
B	no we'll pour them ourselves thank you
A	ah
D	you've got the towel over your arm
A	cheeky
B	if the towel fits wear it
A	ha
B	I mean it the but they've got that haven't they
C	one of these days she's gonna slap you so hard
A	yep
C	one of these days
B	you know they can do that with cars to penalise people
D	yeah
B	oh that car it hasn't got an MOT
D	yeah
B	yep yep
A	look at this
B	yeah? Yeah?
A	who's finishing this?
B	oh
D	who's was that?
B	well it couldn't have been mine
D	yeah but i think there's another danger in having all of your stuff
B	erm
D	on a centralised system
B	well certain talk erm
D	where
B	yeah I know what you mean
D	you get to the state where you you know you get to a
B	but the the police to control people by using that information
D	well no no but once you've go the system in place it can be abused later on
B	yeah go off this I think we're far too laid back
D	you can't travel on this road because you don't have the the correct authorisation
B	but you've got a national health number now
D	mm
B	they've got track of you wherever you go er because you can't get your passport um
D	yeah but it's becoming more sophisticated
B	um
D	mm
B	and they're there for our protection if you look at it that way
D	mm
B	yeah beware
D	no that's not the point
B	mm
D	it can be used for different purposes in the future
B	mm
D	then later on it can really be used to oppress the people
B	erm
D	no but that's what I mean
B	they'd have gone armed with shotguns and they'd have blasted it
D	no but I think most people are saying what you're saying how it it's it's a good thing
B	mm
D	but it's these they do things by such like little erm incremental steps over such a long period of time that
B	yeah yeah softy softy yeah
D	that people don't notice it
B	mm
D	people don't question it
B	no no it's a  it's a  separate issue now because from what I was saying about fines
D	mm
B	now fines I think should be means tested
D	mm
B	because a millionaire now I've known people that are very very wealthy
D	mm
B	so what?
D	yeah yeah
B	I'll just claim that against the expenses
D	yeah
B	and they think nothing of it
D	yeah
B	and that's the difference
D	mm
B	and so I think it you know it should be means tested like that
D	mm
B	somebody who's earning a million pound a year five hundred quid is sod all
D	mm
B	me? It's like half a month's wages
D	mm
B	mm
D	yeah can't you just means test everything?
B	yes darling?

D	mm
B	and then he can memorize them
D	hmm
B	and he was  he was  on breakfast time TV or something and he was they were interviewing him
D	yeah was it one of these walk through techniques where you?
B	similar to that
D	have a story going on in your head
B	yeah that's it
D	yeah
B	you know to it you associate it with
D	so each card playing card is like a member of his family or one of his friends
B	yeah and my brother came along and we went to my sister's house
D	yeah and then
B	and then the she got in her car
D	yeah I tried that
B	yeah
D	mm
B	now I I I used to do it when I was living with a savoy
D	mm
B	I would know every note
D	mm
B	didn't know the page numbers
D	it's lucky that that's a good skill
B	and it was going on in my head
D	mm
B	now I think I couldn't I didn't consciously think of it
D	mm
B	but I used to be thinking about I can put my book down
D	what you actually see them in
B	I'd see them in the air
D	right okay
B	you know and it's there I'm I'm following the music
D	mm
B	the trouble is sometimes we're on the bass clef and I don't even know the notes at the name of the notes on the bass clef
D	mm
B	I know I could work it out quite quickly but I only know the treble clef
D	yeah
B	I can sort of look at the notes straight away
D	mm
B	I don't have to sort of think you know I've seen people doing that you know like as if they're writing it
D	mm
B	mm
B	yes darling?
C	what shall I do with this foil? This er beef? A little bit of beef left
B	yeah Wrap it up in a bit of foil
D	sounds
B	or put it in in a little glass dish
D	I mean it sounds like you're a visual learner
B	yeah
D	um like some people are auditory learners
B	yeah
D	they can like listen to a a story or something
B	yeah
D	I've got no memory link with my ear and my brain
B	mm
D	you get other people who erm like learn kinaesthetically
B	yeah
D	so they you know have to move
B	I mean I use to be able to speed read as well
D	mm
B	I could speed read
D	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b used to be able to read very fast	Entailment
B	and quote from it
D	yeah well
B	and I wasn't even concentrating when I was going
D	mm
B	I'm not thinking about it
D	yeah
B	and then it all sort of comes back
D	you should have worked at
B	A bit before my time
[ANNOTATION]	there are some people who learn by hearing	Entailment
D	mm
B	but I I find cos this uncanny knack I do know the answers to lots of trivia
D	yeah
B	Cos that's all it is
D	mm
B	it's not one of my interests or anything
D	Cos I'm different I've I've got a pretty good memory but I only remember stuff I'm interested in
B	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	speaker d has a very high iq	Neutral
D	if I'm not interested in it it's pff
B	yeah yeah
D	like some kind of people can remember stuff just like really benign facts about things
B	mm
D	I don't know it's a complex thing isn't it
B	yeah cos it's like I've got certain things in my musical career that I remember now
[ANNOTATION]	speaker d likes memory games	Neutral
D	mm
B	and I only did them once
D	hmm
B	like my audition piece
D	mm
B	it's like embedded
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b studied music	Entailment
D	ha
D	yeah
B	and it's the Pirates of Penzance
D	hmm mm
B	the last show is still embedded in me
D	hmm
B	and it always will be
D	you should
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b loves going to the theatre	Neutral
B	erm
D	mm
B	I'm right I was struggling a bit sometimes because I was always being picked up with la and le you know feminine masculine stuff but it was only grammatical errors I was making
D	mm
B	bonjour
D	yeah well that's pretty easy isn't it?
B	well that sort of stuff yeah but I could then turn it into like I wanted the ashtray so
D	avez vous un Cendrier?
B	that's it
D	yeah so my French I I learnt a fair bit I suppose in three years
B	but that's right
D	but I I didn't because I wasn't interested in it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D didn't enjoy learning French	Entailment
B	no I wasn't consciously doing it
D	because I was teaching language all day and the last thing I wanted to do when I got back was to get out a grammar book
B	do another one
D	yep that's yeah yeah
B	would you like a drink? You know
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker D generally doesn't like learning languages	Neutral
D	yeah
B	you know piss wa
D	yeah we had these friends who we went out with the other week
B	yeah
D	he was doing roofing
B	oh yeah
D	and just from doing that because he had the interaction every day with people he was fluent
B	yeah well
[ANNOTATION]	Speaking a language often assists language fluency	Entailment
D	absolutely fluent
B	I'll tell you where's the hammer? Could you give us a hand? Lift this
D	and he had to
B	yeah because of yeah but it's fairly obvious what they're going on about when people say you know give us a lift
D	yeah
B	you know oi lift give us this lift
D	yeah cos you're you have to be forced to use it as well
B	yeah
D	you can't just pick up a book and and try and memorise it
B	that that's probably why it became so easy
B	no we want to learn English
[ANNOTATION]	Memorising grammar books is not how you learn a language	Entailment
D	well that's
B	and they were saying I'll buy you a beer if you talk in English
D	yeah well that is a big problem as well with English speakers
B	they want to learn yeah
D	yeah
B	please can you speak in English
[ANNOTATION]	People like talking to English speakers to learn English	Entailment
D	it makes it very difficult yeah
B	yeah and they were always asking questions
B	and they say ah bottle you know er merci er er
D	yeah
B	beer beer
D	hmm mm
B	beer
D	hmm mm
[ANNOTATION]	French people are good at English	Contradiction
B	yeah once you get around there there well you obviously know from travelling through the various countries
D	mm
B	but there's body language and sign language
D	yeah well mostly not always
B	you know you know it's yeah
D	mm
B	give me a beer
D	yeah
B	cerveza
D	yeah I remember in Vietnam
B	yeah?
D	we used to go to work and the security guards
B	yeah
D	just with normal like backy in it
B	yeah?
D	they've got these big bamboo bongs
B	yeah
D	so I used to walk away
B	yeah?
D	so I'd go away
B	that's erm Bulgaria innit?
D	yeah with the yes and no
B	do you remember Bulgaria?
D	yeah
B	do you sell ice cream? Oh right
D	mm
B	the time we got out of that taxi
D	hmm
B	was it
B	Good God
C	yeah
D	wow
B	three and a half pound in a week
D	three and a half pound in a week? I did eighteen pounds in a couple of hours in the pub last night
B	mm
D	is that a lot eighteen three and a half pounds in a week?
B	yeah
D	mm
B	Cos you you know I mean if you starved yourself
D	yeah
B	you'll die eventually wouldn't you if you didn't eat
D	mm
B	you you'd starve
D	well you've got to stop losing weight at some point
B	that's right yeah but to do it rapidly by not eating is harming your body
D	mm
B	you know what you've gotta do is so you've gotta carrying on eating the right nutrients that your body needs
B	but without all the junk that you don't need
D	yeah
B	you know
D	that's what I was saying to
B	burning off
D	yeah
B	we're sitting on our arses and use our heads
D	yeah
B	so the calories you require are not as much as a manual worker
D	yeah
B	you know a manual worker all day who's er digging trenches
D	yeah
B	it's it's gonna burn it off and the er you know
D	yeah exactly but that's I don't think that's the best way to burn off calories though
B	food is fuel
D	mm
B	and muscle er weighs more than fat
D	mm
B	so but to lose weight and lose body size you've gotta come down into you know it it's all relative innit
D	mm
B	you know you you've got to be fit
D	well it's the balance isn't it
B	fit
D	mm
B	but it's the western world problem innit
D	mm
B	the obesity problems in America
D	mm
B	Cos they're stuffing crap in their faces all day long
D	well it's not you can't
B	no cos even England is the same yeah
D	mm
B	and they're advertising the fact that it's supposed to be good for
D	yeah
B	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah yeah
D	I can see why
B	you know I think you're one of the last generation that's got a finger on the reality of that sort of thing
D	yeah
B	you know I wasn't really strict with you was I?
D	mm
B	you know like demanding you know like Victorian type dogma
D	mm
B	and that's made you a better
D	what's that?
B	yeah he did answer that
C	was he Victorian?
D	victorian?
C	yeah
D	er
B	no I wasn't was I?
C	stop giving him the answers
D	I don't know I'll have to think about that actually
B	I was quite strict at certain things
D	yeah
B	I can remember I certain things
D	no I think it's it's fine being strict
B	but but that's how you learnt what's good what's bad
C	did he ever hit you
D	yeah I haven't got I haven't got a problem with that
C	did he ever hit you?
D	no he never hit me
B	there you go
D	I think he threatened to a couple of times
B	that's right yeah well that's it
D	yeah
B	Don't you dare
D	yeah you've got a pretty scary voice when you're angry
B	yeah
D	yeah yeah yeah
B	and well now you're in that point
D	mm
B	hopefully
A	oh have I walked in on a
B	er only
D	hello
A	er
B	and I hope that the you know you're gonna give them some sort
D	yeah they're gonna be disciplined
A	what are you talking about?
B	er discipline young children is
A	oh er have you not seen how strict I am?
D	yeah
A	I'm pretty strict
B	well I I hope so too you know
D	no I think it's good to be strict to a you know not always
B	because there's certain that educational wallowers roaming the streets now teaching our children that are claiming that you've got to listen to children and take their points of view
D	no
B	how can you ask a five-year-old a serious question? And
D	mm
B	they're got no experience
D	mm
B	so why should you ever take their view? You can listen to their view but they have to do as you tell them
A	yeah you have to listen though
B	and that's the  that's the  end of it
A	yeah yeah
B	listen to them but then if they come out with something outrageous like why shouldn't you run across the road? Only because I haven't got my right shoes on
D	mm
B	but that's what a child
D	yeah but not not just listening but also you need to show a degree of empathy as well
B	yeah and explain
D	me just sitting there listening isn't good enough you have to show that you've understood and took on board what they were saying
B	or explain why
A	oh no you don't want to do that
B	yeah
A	what new
B	A lot of people
D	yeah
B	you know and it does it it affects their education
D	well there's not authority
B	yeah that's right
D	and the teachers have lost their authority
A	yeah
B	exactly because of that
D	the police have lost their authority
B	you can't tell me to do that
D	yeah
A	yeah that's this
B	why should? You can't talk to me like that
D	yeah
B	you know
D	mm
B	you've lost haven't you
A	yeah
D	but on the other hand I mean you've got countries like Japan and Korea where the older generation are just completely revered and looked up to
B	oh
D	because it it does it does depend I mean life is about what you've experienced in the time that you've lived
A	but it's completely different
B	yeah
D	and that doesn't necessarily equate to how old you are
B	that's right
D	I mean you can have a younger person who's a lot more knowledgeable and lot more
B	oh yeah yeah
D	I mean it doesn't necessarily work like that
A	well that's why you have to earn your respect and earn you know people's
D	well that's it exactly
B	that's it no but the youngsters nowadays especially inner city youngsters demand respect
A	yeah that's not good because you have to earn it
B	now that's totally wrong isn't it? You earn respect you don't demand it
A	yeah
D	mm
B	you know the street corner yobs you know
D	mm
B	yo man you show me respect and all that crap
B	I wanna be like you?
D	yeah yeah
B	yeah you know
D	so it's a battle of egos isn't it
B	and that's not
D	but it's got worse I'd
B	yeah
D	or maybe we're just getting older I don't know
A	mm
B	well it has it's got noticeably worse
D	mm
B	I cos I've
D	mm
B	you know children of your age have had children
D	mm
B	children of your age now are grandparents
D	mm
B	how scary is that?
D	mm
B	and when you've watched almost the decline in the standard of behaviour
A	mm
D	mm
B	I'm saying not all you know I'm not
D	yeah
A	no
B	I've I've met some really wonderful parents and you know marvellous kids
D	yeah well of course
B	you know but you know it's like they're almost like feral rats now
D	mm
B	you know they are
D	mm
B	how can you ever teach them? Or er how could you ever turn them round into being?
D	has it not always been like that though?
B	I don't think so
D	mm
B	it was beating and beating and beating
D	but was it? I mean
B	you will do
A	mm
D	I mean  I mean  my view of Victorian is is the literature I've read and that's mostly from higher class apart from Dickens
B	oh yeah the higher classes their their attitude to everything I think was wrong but Dickens was a cos and other writers have well there's an
D	mm
B	and a couple of French writers that were the same
D	mm
B	abject poverty and so on
D	mm
A	mm
D	well what's different now?
B	erm no I think it's because there are the common people haven't got this work ethic that they think they are workers in any way
D	mm
B	they walk around with a Blackberry phone in their hand
A	that's
B	er they haven't got two pennies to rub together
A	but that's half of the problem is is from the benefits of
B	yeah and they think they are doing everything right
D	mm
B	they can't see
D	mm but you can't blame it on that generation because they are just a product of the older generation
B	no no exactly yeah
A	yeah
D	so who do you blame?
B	that's what I'm saying
D	mm
B	Cos we were the hippy era and the ones that rebelled against our parents
D	what you think ironically it was the sixties that was the start of all this mess?
B	er possibly
D	with all the good will and intentions
B	yeah yeah I yeah
A	mm
B	yeah because some you know it was
A	because of the rebellion? Because people rebelled
B	the rebellion against what is you know
[ANNOTATION]	Rebellion probably started in the 60's.	Entailment
D	giving everyone rights and
B	you know we were the first generation that didn't act and dress like our fathers
A	yeah
B	we didn't think of owning the suit
D	mm
B	was the first well you know the most important thing to wear now
D	mm
B	freedom man
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A didn't like their father's generation suit.	Neutral
A	but you know it when cos when when we're travelling and stuff and everybody says oh well
B	yeah yeah
A	so they've gotta give the right to to be treated you know to have a house to live in and everything like that
D	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A believes people have the right to live in a house.	Entailment
B	with our
A	whereas you go to these other countries and if they don't have the benefits and if their family can't support them then they have nothing
D	mm
A	absolutely nothing
B	that's right
A	and they have to work themselves out of that but they can't
B	but that's it
A	and then you appreciate England
B	yeah yeah
A	but you appreciate the benefits then but it is the cause of the bigger problem
D	mm
A	in I don't know
B	it's gone around
D	mm mm
[ANNOTATION]	As a country, England has benefits for the citizens.	Entailment
A	A safety net
B	not the norm
[ANNOTATION]	England is economically safe.	Entailment
D	hmm
B	but that's what it's become
A	mm
D	well I think we're still living in a like post-Second World War mentality where people are like yeah we've won the war erm give me a
B	let's put our feet back and
D	yeah I put my feet up and give me the rewards
A	give me everything
B	that's it yeah
[ANNOTATION]	People who have the winner's mentality favoured the Second World War.	Neutral
D	and I don't have to work
B	yeah
A	yeah then we don't work I mean generalising
D	there's not ethic
B	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah
B	yeah
A	we've got to improve ourselves to get a good education to thus improve our country
B	but don't you don't you
D	improve our children's future
B	that's it
A	and they're thinking of the whole country
B	yeah
A	as a  as a  whole the the community
D	yeah
A	and they're they're thinking of the bigger picture
B	yeah
D	they're saying if I do well and and improve myself then I can help my country
B	mm
A	and building the bigger
D	that doesn't exist here
A	and they strive for this er for this goodness
B	well there is a pride
A	and we don't do that anymore
D	we've done it
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	no that's what I've you know I've instilled it
A	mm
D	mm
B	nowadays
A	you don't know what it's worth yeah
B	and you buy something
A	that cost me half an hour's wage
B	it means nothing if somebody gave me something
D	mm
B	but if I've been out and done a day's work and I got that I know exactly what that's worth
D	oh definitely
A	yeah
B	that's worth an aching back and that's why I've got it
D	yeah
B	that is meaning of life and you know you what you do what you go to work for
D	it gives you a purpose
B	yeah
A	yeah because when I'm working I often think of thing like treats and things that cost me half an hour's work or something like that
B	yeah
A	and then that feels like you know the worth of something when you think of how many hours you have to put in or how much hard work you have to put in
B	yeah exactly
D	yeah
A	which is a good thing with I don't know a currency based on labour or something like that
D	yeah which is
B	mm
D	there is a new idea yeah about a currency that's based on labour
B	yeah
D	like you have to work for a certain amount of hours
B	that's right
D	yeah and then you get it back
A	yeah
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	yeah
B	er if you wanna drink a bottle of whisky that's eight hours' labour
D	yeah
A	yeah
D	yeah and there's a project in London where they're they're doing that kind of thing aren't they
A	well they're doing the community based
D	people having to work for the community
B	yeah
D	and they have to rack up a certain amount of hours work like voluntary work they do
B	yeah? Well it's almost bartering innit
D	yeah and they they can start getting it back
B	it's getting back to the bartering system
D	and they can ask people to do things for them
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	but they have to build up credits to start with
B	yeah yeah yeah
D	they have to put a certain amount of work in to show that they're dedicated to like dedicated to the the project
D	I think it's brilliant
B	when you were a kid do you remember living in Blackwater?
D	mm
B	er when we we had a there was a community there
D	mm
B	the
A	mm
B	there was a roofer
D	mm
B	and there was a mechanic
A	and you knew who they all were?
B	um yeah
D	hmm
A	yep
D	yeah
B	yeah you know I need an MOT on my van you couldn't have a look at that for us could ya?
A	yeah
A	yep
D	mm
B	and that  and that  went round a lot
D	yeah
B	you know the front garden? I got that tree taken out and I got all the turf
A	so that
D	well Thatcher put an end to all that though didn't she
B	yeah
D	huh
B	one night the ceiling fell in
A	is that when Tom fell through the ceiling?
B	and they put a roof new ceiling in and plastered it
D	yeah
B	they did it before I got home from work one day
A	mm
B	and I'd
D	hmm
B	you know
A	mm
B	yeah Government
D	no
A	no it doesn't
B	Cos it's er untaxed
D	yeah exactly
B	in other words untaxed work
A	mm yeah
B	you know
D	huh
B	it's funny
D	well it's all about the self now isn't it?
B	yeah
D	it's all about furthering the self
B	mm
A	mm?
D	and promoting yourself
A	yeah
B	mm
D	it just doesn't exist
A	achievements have kind of got warped like people want to achieve just to show off that they've achieved something
B	yeah yeah
D	mm
A	not to achieve something to make themselves feel good and to help other people
D	yeah
A	which is what achievements used to be
B	I mean it's some of the erm kids that are leaving school they all want to be in IT etcetera
D	mm
B	you can't have a population of IT engineers
D	no well we ha
B	somebody has got to grow the food
A	mm
D	mm
B	somebody has got to drive the food to the supermarkets and put it on the shelves
D	well there's no not many IT jobs left

B	you know
D	yeah
B	and what are they doing? They they're bean counters

B	they're not changing anybody's lives
D	yeah
B	that's unconstructive workers
A	oh yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B has a strong opinion about an occupation.	Entailment
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker B does not think programming is a constructive occupation.	Entailment
B	but there's too many organisers now and not enough people producing the work
D	yeah you're saying it's unconstructive but it's creating an unconstructive country
B	yeah and that's what we are
D	mm we don't produce anything
B	that's what I'm on about yeah
[ANNOTATION]	Two people have strong opinions about certain occupations.	Entailment
D	apart from drugs weapons and financial products we don't produce anything

D	mm
B	yeah yeah yeah
A	because and they sell oranges
B	yeah financial products
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A thinks that selling oranges got Brazil a higher GDP.	Entailment
A	it's insurance
B	exactly
D	the insurance yeah
B	yeah
