A	sorry no it's because um tut if you have some tea with green tea with cranberry or lemon or something and then you don't finish it if you top it up with cold water
B	oh
A	it's nice
B	oh
A	just like a
B	mhm
A	but without the sugar
B	oo you can taste the the cranberry much more
A	can you?
B	in that
A	but it's nice isn't it? It's
B	cranberry flavour comes out much wuh nearly hit the
A	yes
B	um a purple car
B	pulled past
A	wasn't me
B	and then went into the other road the road next to it and then come came back and parked in your drive
A	in my drive?
B	yeah
A	oh
B	yep
A	were talking about this morning
B	no no no
A	and I was thinking my drive?
B	so that must have been the person you were waiting for
A	was she er did she look of Indian origin?
B	yes
A	yes
B	yes
A	er
B	Cos she seemed very dark-skinned
A	yeah
B	mm
A	ah yeah
B	yeah
B	and while I was waiting at the bus stop there was this weird bloke
B	pff
A	what about?
B	well first of all he said have you been waiting long?
B	and I said no not long
B	and I'm sure as I say he didn't know half of them
A	I hate it when people do that
B	and I thought he was a very strange person
A	I hate it when people
B	oh so do I
A	speak on their er mobiles really loudly
B	mm
A	it's
B	and I hate it when you're on the bus and they're on their mobile phone and it's I'm on the bus
B	yes
A	mhm
B	urgh
A	so do you not think he was just trying to chat you up?
B	mm mm
B	at least I desperately hope it wasn't that
A	you do get a lot of wierdos in
B	mm
A	not saying only weirdos would try and chat you up but
B	I'm very pleased you made that clear
A	no there are
B	oh my goodness
A	yeah
B	mm
A	I think
B	well I think
A	mm
B	well it's always had that reputation
A	yeah
B	well you often get people who are a little mm challenged will congregate in a less conventional area
A	really?
B	mm
A	er
B	Cos I think they don't feel quite so out of place
A	oh
B	mm
A	for that reason they're shouting to the skies
B	mm
A	of activity
B	mm
A	I'd assume that it was for that reason
B	well I er expect that's part of it
A	mm
B	they come into that area because they know the pickings are good
B	over and over again
A	on three chords
B	and it wasn't even quite the right tune
B	it was their own variation
B	oh dear me
A	aw
B	it was painful
A	well
B	huh
A	I think er they do it so that you pay them to stop playing
B	yeah
B	he plays outside um Marks and Spencers
A	aw
A	aw
A	poor lad
B	oh dear
A	A bit of a drone aren't they
B	well it's best heard
B	and actually from a distance it's quite a pleasant sound
B	unless you're passionately Scottish of course
A	well in Spain they'd have the gypsies going round
B	mm
A	um round the streets with their what do you call it? The electronic keyboards
B	mm
A	with the automated
B	mm
A	rhythms
B	yep
A	like the one I had
B	yeah
A	but they also get a shopping trolley and make a sound system
A	so they have really loud loud speakers
B	uh
A	and and it is
B	yes
A	it's like the
A	the automatic er rhythm that I used
B	mhm
A	to have on my
B	mm
A	casio keyboard
B	mm
A	dum de de dum dum
A	leaning out of their windows throwing them coins and saying
B	just to shut up
A	now go
B	oh dear
A	mhm
B	of beggars?
A	mhm
B	the children
A	well anyone who has to resort to begging would get my sympathy
B	mm
A	but they'd get my sympathy
B	well
A	er no but is that through necessity cos they can't get a job?
B	no because it's the easy option
A	well I'm not
B	they don't pay any taxes
A	well I'm sure that there's a lot of people who are begging that would prefer to have a job
B	well
A	mm
B	and of course they don't pay taxes
A	well with a minimum wage job not being able to pay er for a living not to be
B	but there are people who do live on er on the minimum wage
A	well I doubt they er make ends meet very comfortably
B	well most people who are on minimum wage qualify for benefits as well
A	hm
B	and especially if they've got children
A	hm
B	huh
A	blimey
B	or seven pounds an hour
A	so what would that be like in a yearly figure? If you
B	um puh depends on how many hours a week you work
A	like if er if you're working full-time hours
B	if you're working a forty-hour week which is about two hundred and eighty pounds a week
A	mm
B	but there is um so people get housing benefit and other benefits as well
A	yep
B	you know
A	well it's like
B	so
A	teaching assistants
B	mm
A	they can be working full-time and be
B	mm
A	getting paid fifteen grand
B	mm
A	that little
B	or that little
A	mm
B	so but then when you think back to what you were getting paid in Spain
A	yeah but that was by no means minimum wage
B	mm
A	mm
B	there's not much difference is there?
A	yeah
B	mm
A	well they're not being paid a fixed er er rate because I don't think there are many posts that are year round
B	no
A	permanent
B	no
A	full-time
B	but then yours wasn't was it? Really
A	they got out of employing you on a permanent basis by making you
B	mm
A	by because of the holidays over the summer
B	mm
A	yep
B	so the Courts Service is not hugely paid
A	but it would be fine if people didn't have to fork out so much for
B	mm
A	I really do believe that
B	and you pay less in on a mortgage than you do in rent provided you can stump up enough of a deposit
A	yeah
B	that's the ridiculous part about it
A	yep
B	it isn't fair
A	but hey
B	but unfortunately it's the law of supply and demand isn't it
A	no
B	are you limping
B	are you limping?
A	it's the cheekiness of some people to to er hike rents up
B	mm
A	and hike prices up just because they can
B	mm
A	well it's even more it's even worse when you're talking about housing because shelter is supposed to be one of the human rights
B	mm
A	housing people I just don't think that's right
B	but then on the other hand people have bought houses have mortgages have to pay the mortgages so they have to charge rent to cover the mortgage
A	mm
B	three hundred thousand quid to to spend
A	what was your scenario again? I didn't catch that
B	that the people who have bought the houses that people rent or the flats that people rent
A	uh-huh
B	have probably bought them on mortgages
A	mm
B	so they've got to pay the mortgage so they have to pay they have the tenants have to pay the mortgage costs
A	so while this other guy is living comfortably in his own little house
B	because
A	why
B	but he's still got
A	be able to make a profit out of?
B	well he's he's still got overheads
A	yeah
B	all that sort of thing
A	fair enough
B	well it's like any business
A	yeah er what I'm saying is that er housing shouldn't be for profit
B	unfortunately
A	so it should be divorced
B	everything's for profit
A	yeah
B	that's life
A	I just think it should be divorced from the idea of business
B	tis in the nature of the beast unfortunately
A	well they need to put some restrictions and regulations in place
B	mm
A	people homeless because they can't afford to to live in a marketplace house
B	I would be interested to know how much the
A	really?
B	mm
A	again that needs to be changed as well
B	mm
A	who was running all the student accommodation for profit because it's a business
B	mm
A	and all of a sudden the refuse collection is cut to once every two weeks
B	mm
A	with like twenty students for each bin
B	mm
A	around
B	mm
A	instead of having um a very basic but free internet connection
B	mm
A	they they again outsourced the internet to another company who came in and put super rapid quick fire amazing internet in but then charged you
B	mm
A	per person fifteen quid
B	how often? Fifteen quid
A	A month
B	per month?
A	yeah
B	oo
A	so you're thinking if if ten students sign up for it in one house
B	mm
A	you know they're raking in a hundred and fifty on what they would in
B	mhm
A	a normal house probably only thirty or forty
B	mm
A	so it just became for
B	mm
A	you know where is the whole ethos
B	but I'm
A	of
B	yeah
A	mm
B	I mean when you think back to when I was at college we paid nothing
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yep
B	but I I still feel that universities should go back to being centres of academic
A	I agree
B	and have
A	there is none
B	it's ridiculous
A	oh
B	Michael Gove
B	I'm thinking about it in my
A	what?
B	you remember when we went sailing and we were going to go to Lakka on Paxos?
A	uh-huh
B	and normally he will navigate us everywhere
A	mhm
B	but this time he said no no no we'll see it
B	because we missed Lakka um it was rather daunting experience
A	oh so it's not a letter of complaint? It's a
B	no no no
A	oh I thought you said it was a letter
B	oh no no
A	is it on Paxos?
B	mm
A	then how come you missed it?
B	well it's got a very narrow entrance and then opens out into this big harbour type thing
A	mm
B	and the very narrow entrance is not easy to see
B	it just looked like rocks and things
B	and I was getting decidedly panicky
B	I just wanted to get off
A	so are you going to do it again this year?
B	not in the same sort of boat
A	oh is he only getting a motor boat this year?
B	yes
A	mm
B	so we're having the the Villa Melissa for two weeks
A	oh last time did you stay on the boat all the time?
B	for one week
A	oh
B	we had a boat for a week and then a villa for the week
A	oh
B	that was when we were in Talenti's House
A	aw
B	right on the water
A	you'll have some fun
B	I just want to go away
A	sorry?
A	when are you going?
B	June fourth
A	miaow
B	I can't be got at
B	huh
A	well you could do that here
B	oh no I can't
A	yes you can
B	no I can't
A	just pretend that you've gone away
B	no I'm contactable unfortunately
A	well you could always switch your phone off and just not answer the telephone
B	yeah but people know I'm here  people know I'm here
A	how? They don't have spies out
B	oh they do
A	mhm
B	do is um tut Angie from work
A	okay
B	she's a very interesting person
A	oh
A	Cos they know her?
B	yeah
A	ah
B	and of course they call all the senior police ladies ma'am
B	Cos she was a chief inspector
A	yeah
B	so I will contact her and
A	have to behave myself
A	for the duration of an hour
B	Cos they live in Hampton-in-Arden
A	ah
B	which is not that far away
A	so why does she work at the court?
B	because she retired from the police when she was fifty-five
A	did she get bored?
B	no she met
A	mhm
B	at all and she met
A	and who is
B	her husband
A	yeah I know
B	no no
A	mhm
B	and then they got married
A	mhm
B	er
A	that's what I meant
A	yep
B	but she's retiring from that later on this year
A	had enough now
B	well you know
A	mm
B	he was quite a a tie
A	mhm
B	um and she has a sister whose husband died very recently
A	bloody hell
B	mm
A	oh I got contacted by you remember the Russian girl?
B	mm
A	anastasia
B	mm
A	pff
B	pff
A	so seven years
B	now hang on
A	well it's appeal against his fifteen years imprisonment for the murder of his wife
B	that's right
A	so she asked me to write a witness statement to
B	no but they're they're read out in the court proceedings
A	oh right
B	I think
A	er
B	but huh what them charge him with her murder?
A	I don't know
B	is this in in Spain?
A	no in France
B	in France?
A	it happened in France
B	fff
A	and there is no there's no um tut no evidence of accelerants on his clothes on his hands on the car on the body on
B	mm
A	what do you call it? A
B	explosion
A	a flash
B	yeah
A	and so he was actually on the phone to the police at the time given by three independent witnesses saying that they saw this huge explosion
B	how long had she been missing?
A	well he'd organized to meet her two hours before
B	and she hadn't turned up?
A	no
B	mind you you see they could argue mind you if they didn't find anything on the car
A	well it's crazy
B	mind you the French judicial system is
A	well they're
B	a bit funny isn't it
A	yeah yeah
B	mm
A	mother had died
A	you know if you ask an eleven-year-old what happened last night? Oh yeah mum dropped the
B	yeah
A	not
B	yeah
A	well er she used the word upset
B	yes
A	it doesn't mean that
B	I hope
A	and so they used that her saying that
B	so they used that as a cause
A	they used that
B	for him
A	no they used that as evidence that they had been arguing
B	but she didn't mention that her father was there?
A	not even no
B	did they ask her whether her father was there?
A	I have no idea
B	I I hope they had um an appropriate adult with the child? But then I don't know what the rules are in France
A	mm
B	jeepers
A	and she was eleven
B	and he's been in prison all this time?
A	no he got um tut he spent four years in prison right after it happened
A	and
B	dear God
A	I think it was last September
B	hm
A	there was a er he went to court and and they didn't
B	you see in
A	oh I don't understand
B	France it's not the police who are er responsible for bringing charges
A	yeah
B	he's not a police officer
A	medico-legal
B	no
A	mm
B	and it just strikes me that it's not huh I think there are more chances of mistakes being made that way
A	well this is a huge mistake
B	you're not kidding
A	I mean they've got no evidence whatsoever that gives him a motive or um
B	opportunity
B	yeah
A	he was a businessman
B	in Russian mafia
A	in Uzbekistan
B	mm
A	he couldn't do business freely
B	mm
A	it was all he was always visited by the mafia
B	mm
A	and they always made it very difficult for him to operate cleanly
B	mm
A	and so that was the motivation behind him leaving
B	but even so
A	no idea
B	I mean how else do they explain the fact that the car exploded?
A	they haven't  they haven't  explained it
B	no they've they've got him and that's all they're interested in
A	because they're just interested in pointing the finger at him and
B	you see over here that would've gone to forensics
A	hm
B	exactly what the cause of the explosion was
A	well I'm sure they would've done but
B	you never know do you
A	well exactly
B	you can't do that
A	the logic behind it
B	well yeah
A	well he
B	yeah
A	I don't know  I don't know  if it's jury
B	is it the judge?
A	or
B	no I suspect it'd be a judge
A	really?
B	Cos that's usually what happens here
A	hm
B	but that's terrible
A	nineteen
B	nineteen
A	yep
B	has she got other relatives?
A	um not outside of Russia
B	bloody hell
A	which luckily I think were a really nice family
B	yeah
A	and have
B	yeah
A	have were able to keep her for all
B	mm
A	you know from when she was eleven to when she was eighteen
B	but what a traumatic experience for the poor girl
A	but not only losing your mother in
B	mm
A	such a freak accident or whatever it was
[ANNOTATION]	Person A is going to dance	Contradiction
B	you lose your father as well
A	then your father is is taken away from you just at the time when you need him
B	mm
A	most
B	mm
A	imprisoned with no
B	mm
A	for no reason
B	has she been able to see her father while he's been in prison?
A	I think they've had um they've been allowed to have one visit every month
[ANNOTATION]	Person A said that could see each other one in the month	Neutral
B	dear God
A	even when he's been out of prison he's only been like allowed to visit her once a month
B	Good grief
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	and he's in an awful situation
B	poor girl
A	when he's out of prison he doesn't have he has no papers
B	they've take oh
A	his visa and everything
B	mm
A	but he's not allowed to leave France
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	Person B believe that the gap is useful for him	Contradiction
B	how does he support himself though?
A	well that's the thing
B	mm
A	now
B	mm
A	Cos they've revoked his um status
B	but where does that leave her?
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to do some hair cut	Contradiction
A	well now she's like independent cos she's over eighteen and she's at university and she lives with her boyfriend and
B	but they haven't taken her ability to to live there? Visa
A	no
B	so if he's if they then decide that he's not guilty presumably he gets all that back? One assumes
A	well I should bloody hope so
B	one assumes
A	well I've seen cos
B	mm
A	with all these witness testimonials and it er media coverage of it
B	mm
A	but there doesn't seem to be a lot of there seem to be quite a lot of articles but they all seem to be saying the same thing
B	mm
A	oo this man has been duddle luddle luddle luh
B	mm
A	and the lack oh sensationalist no not sensationalist but just there to amuse people as opposed to
B	it's not investigative journalism
A	no
B	no
A	the daily hate
B	do a lot of um investigative journalism and trying to change things
A	and has it worked?
B	well he still hasn't been deported
A	hm
B	and still he's not been deported
A	mm
B	but why we signed up to this treaty with the Americans and this European Arrest Warrant business
A	oh my life
B	but he was arrested he and his friend were arrested but the descriptions that the victim gave of the people who attacked him was nothing like these two
A	mm
B	didn't die they wanted him for murder
A	did this happen in Portugal?
B	yep
A	uh
B	but the guy didn't die but they still want him on the arrest warrant it's for murder
A	er the guys who
B	mm
A	described
B	completely different people
A	they want
B	they want
A	ow
B	this one guy only
A	the one that er
B	mhm
A	for it?
B	but only one of them
A	and did the guy die
B	no
A	in the end?
A	he's still alive?
B	he's still alive
A	tut
B	so how can they
A	mm
B	want him for
A	hm
B	it just seems a bit lopsided to me
A	it does
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure that is lopsided or not	Neutral
B	and then you look at
A	is the Daily Mail reporting the facts?
B	no no no
A	facts
B	no no no
A	between speech marks
B	no
A	oo
B	but the the way the Portuguese police handled the Madeleine McCann
A	yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about Portuguese police	Entailment
B	you know
A	mm
B	than many others
A	hm
B	but huh I just
A	no I've heard the French legal system criticized before
B	mm
A	but I don't know upon
B	mm
A	what grounds
B	I think it is because um the police have no involvement other than the investigation
A	oh wait there  wait there wait there  Have you read you've read the Kay Scarpetta novels haven't you?
B	yep
A	Patricia Cornwell
[ANNOTATION]	person A is talking about one person	Entailment
B	mhm
A	isn't there's one that takes place in Paris
B	is there?
A	yeah
B	I don't think I've read that one
A	haven't you?
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure that is in Paris or not	Neutral
B	Don't think so
A	now I've got a feeling that it's the equivalent of the Kay Scarpetta American woman
B	well in Kay Scarpetta's novels the the what's her face is the medical examiner
A	yep
B	which is not the same thing at all
A	that's my point
B	she
[ANNOTATION]	they are  not sure about this novels	Neutral
A	mhm
B	and the forensic evidence
A	mhm
B	well that's usually that's what happens here
A	judge the case
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about murder	Neutral
B	oh I don't know about judge the case
A	sorry
B	I I don't know
A	hm
B	isn't it France that it's called the Napoleonic Code?
A	I have no idea
B	I think
B	I'm not absolutely sure
A	I might look into it
B	mm
A	yes
B	mm
A	but at least he's got some support
B	mm
A	but I really don't know any details
B	no
A	I've only had very sporadic and short contact with them
B	mm
A	it is
B	now it begs the question
A	well they bloody should
B	mm
A	I hope that that is what happens
B	it's not fair
A	destitute
B	yeah
A	now
B	yeah
A	if they do acquit him you know he's
B	well
A	mm
B	and they'd spent God knows how long in prison
A	mm
B	I'm beginning to wonder whether the French know how it works
A	easy Tiger
A	she hasn't even come close to you
B	no but
A	stop it
B	she's here in the room
A	stop it
B	shh
B	silly girl
A	yeah
B	I don't know the difference the two I don't know enough of the difference between the two systems
B	but I
A	I don't know
B	no I er mm
A	what kind of code is it here?
B	er I don't think we have a a name for it
A	mm
B	no the huh I'm not sure whether the Napoleonic Code refers to the way um estates are inherited
A	yeah
B	I think in France it has to be distributed amongst everybody where we have I don't know
A	well I I was just thinking oh I wish I had my laptop
A	I've got a smartphone now
A	what would it be? French justice system?
B	um
A	or penal code?
B	I
A	or?
B	oo
A	okay
B	yeah
A	oh common law systems have evolved over the ages
A	I don't know
B	that doesn't really help us very much does it?
A	but you're right about Napoleon though
B	mm
A	there are other codes including the penal code which defines criminal law
B	yep
A	yeah
B	I think we call that civil law
A	you see I think that's why he had to have two different um tut tribunals? What do you call them?
B	yeah
A	court appearances
B	yeah
A	one for er civil and one for penal
B	jeepers
A	all crimes do?
B	yep
A	hm
B	mm
A	in courts
B	the assize courts
A	assize
B	are
A	what's an assize court?
B	um it's wuh it's a sort of next stage up um er no assize court
A	I have no idea
B	no
A	is that a local court as opposed to a national court?
B	it's you've got the
A	oh okay
B	and our Crown Court is in
A	oh right
B	and then there's another one in um Warwick
A	mhm
B	well it was in Warwick
A	mhm
B	so it goes in bigger areas
A	I see
B	but it is
A	hm
B	because I think that's probably a bit of an out of date title
A	I don't understand all this stuff that's I don't understand the
B	well it is passed
A	oh?
B	from the Latin assidere
A	you learn something new every day don't you
B	you certainly do
A	maybe it would be more informative looking at penal code
B	well I think the penal code is just the um sort of sentencing for different crimes
A	oh really?
B	I think so
A	it's on how the process of how that is
B	no
A	gone about?
B	no
A	yeah like categorizing offences
B	mm
A	hm
B	I've no idea either
A	the the whole judgement process
B	I suppose you could google the er French judicial system
A	ah the judicial system
B	mhm
A	as opposed to the legal system
B	mm
A	pardon me
B	but you'd want it specifically for France because they're all so different
A	french
A	it's just
B	I don't think so
A	with this thumb that doesn't work properly
B	yeah
B	yeah
A	oh look she's gone asleep in the sun
B	soppy cat
A	gone to sleep
B	mind you they haven't done too badly
A	mm
B	sitting up there er they get quite er if any if there is any sun they get it in there
A	yeah
B	no
A	all the time do they?
B	no
A	mm
B	I suppose if the door come the summer when the door's left open they'll be able to wander in and out at will
A	oh I have no idea
B	mm
A	it's too much information to be able to understand
A	um in such a small screen
B	yes
A	I really find that with those
B	mm
A	tiny screens
B	I I couldn't get on with them at all
A	to view a whole web page
B	yes
A	it's quite disorienting cos you
B	no no no
A	don't have enough space
B	no I do not want a smarty-pants phone
B	thank you very much
B	I'm quite happy with mine that takes calls makes calls takes
B	receives texts and makes texts
A	yep
B	and it's so difficult to retrieve blooming answer phone messages on my mobile phone
A	really?
B	sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't
A	oh it's annoying
B	mm
A	well I was getting on my er other mobile phone I was getting messages like six weeks after someone had left me a message
A	saying that I had a message
B	oh really helpful
A	it was so annoying
B	oh dear
A	what are the charges for phoning a mobile from a land-line here?
B	I have no idea
A	Cos they must be quite expensive
B	I've no idea
A	and when you're phoning from your mobile is it cheaper to phone another mobile as opposed to phoning a land-line?
B	I couldn't tell you
A	hm
B	mm
A	that's how it works in Spain
B	mm
A	oh no sorry that er it's cheaper to phone a mobile from a mobile
B	oh
A	and it's cheaper to phone a land-line from a land-line
B	oh well I don't know then
A	and the land-line to mobile's expensive
B	to land-line
A	to land-line
B	I have no idea
A	who? God?
B	yep
B	but my mobile phone bill this month was only seven pounds
A	oo
B	I have been very parsimonious in my use
A	you mostly send text messages though don't you?
B	pardon?
A	you mostly send text messages don't you?
B	er by and large
A	yep
B	er they need an answer now sort of thing
A	yep
B	and I'm not convinced that that's a good idea
A	well I think it is in a way because you don't have to rely on that other
B	no
A	available
B	no
A	to communicate at er
B	no
A	precisely the moment that you'd wanna
B	but it also tends to increase the number of messages you send
B	and it you know it's sort of self-perpetuating circle of messages
B	drives you round the bend
A	which could be dealt with in
B	yeah
A	a short phone
B	on a phone call
A	yeah
B	no
A	that much
B	no
A	so I don't mind
B	no
A	I actually prefer text messaging
B	mm
A	like when you're in the supermarket or when you're
B	mm
A	just coming out of work or
B	mm
A	and you just don't have it in your head to be able to
B	no
A	make arrangements or something
B	mm
A	I just
B	but I always work on the principle that if it's important enough they'll phone back
B	you know
A	these screens get so
B	yeah
A	dirty as well
B	but
A	especially if you wear make-up
B	before we had mobile phones and we weren't instantly contactable we managed
A	yeah
B	you know
A	yep
B	in a business situation I suppose I can understand it
A	mm
B	urgh
A	that I would phone him closer to the weekend
B	right
A	and sort out a time
B	yep
A	what are you up to this weekend?
B	oh don't ask me that
A	you don't know?
B	haven't got a clue
A	Cos if he comes round here you know it would be nice if
B	mm
A	you were there as well
B	it's easier I think if you do it here because you've got the set-up
A	yeah
B	and there isn't anybody else around
A	yeah I know
B	we'll he'll
A	no he won't
B	I can't

B	he took me and I thought my God if I try to find my way round here
B	it's a nightmare
A	that's where we were driving today on the
B	was it?
A	driving lesson
B	what sort of things were you covering today?
A	er roundabouts
B	roundabouts
