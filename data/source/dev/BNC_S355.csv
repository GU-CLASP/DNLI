C	I would erm
B	it's whatever you choose there's some slight compromise one way or another
[ANNOTATION]	The things they want to buy were expensive	Entailment
C	yes
B	you know if you want a high performance one it's either doesn't smell too nice or

A	yeah
D	but I they've er that Hougoumont farm
A	yes
D	and that area they've er
A	mm
D	with the
A	to show what it looked like at the time
D	mm it's all been
A	yes
D	well for this for this big
A	occasion
A	yeah
D	commemorative
C	you rang up erm radio
D	oh about the Zeppelin
C	mm
D	and last night they rang me back
A	oh right
D	they said it was er
A	oh right
D	and I says oh she said now and if you can get it on Iplayer
A	right
D	you can still see it on Iplayer and I said how long er how long
A	mm
D	she said it's it's three hours
A	wow it's a bit of marathon
C	mm
A	isn't it?
C	mm
D	mm but you see we saw pictures
C	mm
D	about it didn't they?
C	yes
D	and it showed er you know some bomb damage
C	mm
D	from this Zeppelin in er city centre one in particular was alongside of the
A	mm
C	yes
A	mm
D	you know so you know down there
C	yeah
A	yes yeah rather than now
C	more than they do now
A	mm
D	mm
B	university of
A	mm
C	good
A	show grandad
D	could I see it?
C	you haven't found your
B	no
A	mm
B	definitely not I'm still on the search
C	it's irritating when you lose
B	it is irritating sort of
C	yes
B	become sort of attached to my erm because I
C	yeah
A	well we've checked in the library now and we've checked in
C	oh
A	and then
C	yeah
A	haven't found it
C	oh
A	so
C	oh yeah
A	I don't know
D	is that a
A	oh I don't know
D	have we checked on that?
A	doesn't say
D	in that case I should
A	mm
D	wash it by hand
A	doesn't say on the bottom does it?
B	no
A	doesn't say anything
D	well you've got to know these things now haven't you?
A	yeah
D	you just can't go willy-nilly washing up like that though oh no
A	yeah
B	well
D	or bag them in here bang them in there what you got there
B	more chocolates
D	hey some more chocolate
B	supposed to be it was my our dishwasher's coming to the end of its life
C	the dishwasher?
B	yes
C	oh is it really?
B	really
C	oh
D	is it?
C	oh it's not not repairable?
D	how long have you had it?
B	ten years
D	mm
C	it's not repairable?
B	well
A	well
B	the problem is
A	there's a hefty callout fee
C	oh heavens yeah
B	erm Miele the make don't distribute the parts to any other person they will keep all the parts to themselves
C	oh right
B	so unless
D	they've got the monopoly there then
B	it's a Miele man who comes to look at it
C	I see yes
B	you it's
C	you couldn't
B	no you can't
C	get the parts yeah
B	but it's ninety-five pounds to call them out
D	how much?
B	ninety-five pounds plus vat to call them out
D	ninety-five?
B	yes
C	yes
B	ninety-five yes
D	nine five?
C	yeah
B	nine five
A	that's why I'm hesitating
B	plus VAT and then eighty pounds for each additional hour plus parts
C	good grief you could put that towards another one couldn't you?
D	well
A	well that's what we're going to do
D	it's obviously er to get you buy another isn't it?
A	yeah
C	yeah
A	that's it
D	mm
B	the crucial thing is possibly this time to try and get one with a longer guarantee if you get one with a ten-year guarantee
C	oh right yes
B	then there's no charge for them to come out
C	would you get the same make?
B	it's a bit of the problem and if you're opening the good old Which magazine
C	oh yes yeah
B	the best maybe six or seven dishwashers are all Miele the top seven
C	are they really?
B	yes
C	oh
D	are they?
C	oh
B	Miele is supposed to be the most reliable as well
C	oh
B	so it's a bit of a problem
A	but they do make a meal of it
B	yes
A	if you have to call them out
C	yes yeah
D	that's what I was thinking
A	mm
B	there are
C	oh dear that is tough isn't it that?
B	they they seem to kind of have a bit of a
D	monopoly
B	monopoly
A	attitude problem I was going to say
D	and an attitude problem
C	yes
D	mm
C	oh well
B	we can use it it goes through the first cycle but it doesn't finish so it'll
C	oh
B	only really rinse them
C	oh and
A	you still need to dry them
C	yeah
A	and quite often when you open it there's still standing water in the bottom so
C	oh
A	it's not very good
C	yeah
D	it's not draining off like?
A	no
C	yeah
D	not pumping it out?
A	no
C	mm
D	you haven't talked to anyone else like a you know a washer man or somebody?
B	well we did call someone else in but he wasn't really much use
D	mm
A	he didn't really do anything
D	mm
C	did he charge?
A	yes
B	mm it's always seems a bit hard to get
D	I know I know it's
C	mm yeah yeah
D	getting
A	I know you always feel like you've been stitched up when
D	oh yeah I did
A	yeah
D	mm
B	yeah
A	quite
B	recently had the light switch in the upstairs bathroom replaced
C	oh yeah
B	this was a little small saga shall we say?
D	mm
A	mm
B	it's well the first person didn't properly tighten one of the leads that meant after two weeks it didn't work
C	oh
B	so
C	dear
B	it had to go through the process of getting them to come back
C	oh right
A	mm seems to be alright now
B	yes it's
D	mm
B	alright
D	is it a pull switch?
A	yes a cord
D	mm
A	yeah
C	well our toilet the one downstairs erm it was when you press the you know the flush thing it made a horrible noise didn't it?

D	no
B	travel on
D	no it isn't no
B	and we got that
D	well it wasn't was it?
B	but er
D	it's a great er
A	mm
B	yeah
A	it was very twisty and narrow
C	mm
A	in parts
D	mm yeah
B	of course there's barriers over that bridge
D	yeah
B	if you know what I mean
D	oh yes
B	yes
D	yeah yes that was a tricky one
A	mm
D	mm
B	you know some people try and do that in
A	mm
C	oh what's the thing underneath it
A	a
C	no oh is it another plate?
A	yeah there's four plates

A	mm
C	yes
B	sometimes it's
A	excellent
B	a bit showery
A	mm
C	mm yeah
A	yes
A	yes
A	remember when we used to put a table outside when it was
B	and it was
A	it was fine again
D	mm
A	and then we took out again only to bring it back in again
D	didn't we have a
A	more like the hokey-cokey really
D	a gazebo type thing?
A	yes yes
C	well maybe you had the table here one time when
A	yes
A	I know
D	your grandad was here
C	mm
D	wasn't he?
A	yeah
D	and grandma I think
C	yeah
A	that's right
D	mm
A	we didn't know what to do for the best did we?
C	no
D	mm
C	no
A	that happened more than once didn't it?
C	it did
A	two or three times anyway
C	mm
B	so er what did you think to the university?
C	well I thought it
D	mm
C	thank I I remember mind you it's about a few years ago
A	yeah
C	but erm
B	mm
A	it's a huge place
C	it is a huge place
D	and we I thought it was a
C	and I didn't know it was as modern as that
D	what with the
A	mm
D	er and
A	yeah it's tidy
C	yes
D	well
C	it's clean isn't it?
D	organised
A	no litter or graffiti
B	no
A	or anything
C	no
A	is there?
C	no
D	mm
C	I thought it was more like the
A	first bit
C	first bit
A	yeah
C	that's the part I remember
A	mm
B	it is very big I I mean it's it not there are ones that are much bigger than that that's
C	yeah
B	not a really big one as far as
C	no
B	universities go
D	so did you say I think you said fifteen thousand
B	yes
D	is that on that site we was on or is that the whole thing?
B	oh for the whole site yes
D	the the
A	the whole thing
D	other sites as well?
D	the whole
B	yes mm
D	yes mm
D	fifteen thousand
B	that's that's including part time
D	mm
B	yes
A	mm
B	students
A	mm
B	mm
A	get rid of this paper
D	I see when we come past er
B	mm
D	I mean in the centre of town
B	yes
D	in er
B	that's
D	and you know this college is I mean something like that isn't it?
C	mm
D	in conjunction with the
C	mm
B	yes
D	mm I don't know how much or or whether you can get stuff from there which comes up on cos there's some really good programmes come up on the Open University aren't they?
B	mm
D	and it says you can send here and you know they'll send you it free and all that business whatever it is mm there's that that was a it's a pretty good idea that I think the Open University in a way mm
C	do you have to pay for that?
B	yes
C	do you? oh right
B	it's I don't think it's nine thousand but you
C	no
B	it is still a few thousand
C	yeah yeah
B	I think it's quite popular
C	mm
B	the Open University yeah
D	mm
C	mm
D	I I do
B	mm
D	well the thing is it's it's always on telly isn't it?
B	it is
D	it's always on television
B	yes
D	so you know advertising counts it pays doesn't it?
B	yes
D	advertising so it's always in a way advertising itself
C	mm yeah
B	mm
C	no no
B	no
D	no no we haven't been that way
C	it seemed quite popular
B	yes it it is
C	mm
B	very popular
A	yeah
D	it was for saying it's like out in the wilds in a way
C	mm
D	isn't it? you know it's
D	you know it's not
B	mm
D	it's not on the er local run like is it?
B	no
C	no
B	anyhow I'll get a a map and show you
D	yes show me
B	the route
D	see where you lost me then
D	it's stuck there
C	my back's aching
D	it's er around twenty to three been a
B	I can't believe that Sony have now stopped making laptops
D	who?
B	Sony
D	not mine is it?
B	no
D	Toshiba
B	well mine's a Sony
D	oh is it?
B	yes
D	mm
B	they've stopped making them altogether now
D	mm
B	it's I think that's
D	mm
B	quite surprising
D	mm mm mm
B	I'll just make a screen a bit brighter
D	yeah so er
B	I have on
D	the
B	the lowest setting as you know
D	I I need all the help I can get
B	I know you do
D	whatever I have on
B	yes
D	whatever I do
B	although I can get seven hours out of the battery if it's on the lowest setting
D	mm
B	but only maybe
D	oh do you? mm
B	it's really as much as that
D	mm funny that because I was wondering why
B	yes
D	well it's up to you I'll however you present it you'll have to talk me through it
B	right so there's a good map
D	yeah
B	there's
D	uhu
B	so obviously we're currently there at
D	that's
B	that's
B	yes there
D	mm
B	er obviously now this route so we're down to the A64 there
D	yeah
B	first roundabout that you come to there
D	yes
B	yes
D	we did
B	and continued on the A64
D	mm
B	and then you take the next exit
D	uhu
B	and then went along
D	uhu
B	and then see this other road here?
D	yeah
B	that's went round there that's a sports centre and we drew up up there you know that was the brick row with all the
D	yeah
B	and then we parked in this car park
D	uhu
B	there
D	uhu
B	then we walked back to the car park and car access isn't allowed down
D	mm
B	so we had to go back to
D	yeah
B	the first exit down to
D	uhu
B	we went round there up here and that roundabout then went into this car park here and the library's there
D	uhu
C	so do you know how much marking you've got to do then
A	er thirteen thousand questions
C	oh right
A	yeah I'm alright when I'm with
C	yeah
A	I'd be scared by myself in a way cos I don't know where I'm going
C	no
A	I don't know
A	well you just would have had certain routes
C	mm
A	er I haven't tried yet no
C	no
A	I can go to
C	mm
A	I can go to school and
C	yes
A	I can go
C	mm yeah well routes
A	I wouldn't want to go much further
C	no
A	I can take us out to
C	yeah well that's
A	I've got some options
C	you could
[ANNOTATION]	All the speakers went to the same school.	Neutral
A	yeah
C	yeah well yeah
A	yeah confident in
C	yes yeah
A	mm
C	mm
A	for during the summer holidays
C	mm
A	things like that
[ANNOTATION]	They cannot and will not go to school.	Contradiction
C	you've been to quite a few places haven't you?
A	mm yeah
C	have you been to
A	no we haven't
C	no?
A	no
C	no
A	can't remember it all
C	yeah
B	you can't remember?
A	how to get to the university er by myself
B	oh right
A	can I?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A will go to university in two years time.	Neutral
A	I can't remember it all
B	mm
C	mm yes it
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A remembers it perfectly.	Contradiction
A	so I start thinking I think I should have
A	done something turned off before now
A	I seem to have been on this road a long time
C	well then your dad said it was further than he thought
A	it was yeah
C	yeah
A	and it's getting in all the right lanes as well
[ANNOTATION]	They have been in the same road for some time.	Entailment
C	oh yes
A	I still can't remember all that
C	inner road all that
A	and
C	yeah
A	on the roundabouts that was different lanes on the roundabout and there's traffic lights on the roundabout I found that a bit unusual
C	mm mm
A	yeah
C	I'd be stopping every five minutes
A	I don't know how
C	I don't
A	he just knows and
C	yeah
A	it's alright you know he says if you drive down I'll drive back because I'll know it by then
C	yes right
A	well I won't
C	yeah
A	he says well you remember this and you remember
C	yes but not
A	by myself
C	no well even if when you're going to a place erm and we come out of a different entrance
A	of a shop yes it's a bit confusing
C	I don't remember this bit
A	not right
B	and then I'll show you the way to the
D	oh right
B	so we started there came out along
D	mm
B	but we took the second exit it's the A166 er but just zoom out show you where the A166 goes so it goes
D	uhu
B	but actually you were going a bit between
D	yes
B	yes
D	yeah
B	same road here
D	mm
D	so yeah at
B	yes
D	that road er
B	I mean the pass and the roundabout that good straight road
B	you'd go up here
B	yes
D	yes that's it
B	yes
D	there that one
B	and then you'd turn
D	up there somewhere
B	yes
D	mm and then there
B	then this up there
D	yeah when I got to
B	yes
D	if I went er straight to there I'd come to
B	yes
D	mm mm
B	yeah
D	uhu
B	and then I'll show you this back road which is not easy to follow but er anyway
A	I hate it when they say back road
C	yes
A	is it back of what?
A	doesn't make sense
B	well what would you call it then?
A	I don't know
B	well
A	well because I don't think there should be two ways of getting to the same place that's not a good er is it?
B	well
D	that's confusing
D	mm
B	well
A	you just stick to one
B	it's in some ways it's good you have two ways because if one's
A	yes
B	clogged up
A	yes
B	we've got another
A	an alternative
B	you know if
A	yeah
B	I've got to be at the university for a set time
A	mm
B	and there's a big traffic jam on the A64
C	mm
B	that's a really useful route to know
A	suppose
C	well your mum she did really well when you went up to that school
A	mm
C	and er you went up a few times didn't you
A	oh yes
C	to
A	yeah no no no no
C	don't tell me
A	if I remember one way I'll be glad
C	yes
C	well you did that for quite a while didn't you?
A	mm about five years
C	yeah
A	mm
C	was it what is it? five years?
A	mm
C	oh
A	yeah
C	I never know where I am when we go up that way I used to hate going to
A	mm
C	you know it was up that way where dad said this is the way I used to
A	yeah
C	it just seems alien to me
A	it does it's so unfamiliar
C	yeah
B	it's er well we turned up erm
D	uhu
B	and then that's that really awful bend do you remember?
D	yes I do
B	that's and then this road goes to a village called
D	uhu
B	there's that that's all that
D	mm
C	mm
D	we'll stick to the A roads
C	okay
C	mm
A	mm
D	oh it got murder there
D	and there was people trying to cross that
A	mm
D	little road that we
D	until we get over the railway line we do a left turn well there was cars there waiting to come out there and they was over a bit you know so
A	mm
D	very difficult to do that turn
A	I know
B	it is
D	and if people
C	it's tight isn't it?
D	trying to get through there
A	I know
D	mm
A	there's maybe a bike and a pushchair and
D	oh
B	what is a bit of a shame is there is a good maybe seventy-five a hundred metres from the station to that crossing which is perfectly straight it would be it wouldn't be too difficult to actually have a little tunnel under there
D	another little?
B	a tunnel under the
D	a tunnel
B	that road
D	mm
B	I mean there's enough
C	mm
B	to just have a gentle
A	what for people
D	mm
B	decline
A	you mean?
B	no the well it would be the railway track
D	mm
A	oh for the train to go under?
B	yes
D	mm
B	well it would be much safer
C	mm it would
B	I don't think that crossing is not
D	ah no it wouldn't
B	that would be the only problem it would have be
A	mm
B	very well
D	cos when there were floods was here
B	yeah
C	mm
A	that's where it was
C	yes
D	we took him didn't we? to see
C	yes
D	on that car park
C	mm
D	Morrisons car park
C	oh yes
D	mm Wellingtons on wasn't it?
C	yes
D	mm I was amazed how much of that mind you you've got that wall there haven't now
A	yeah they have now
D	but nevertheless it would still hey you've got a dirty screen there
B	mm
D	fingerprints there it's almost a good pattern isn't it?
B	but it's it would really be the best way because if you've there wouldn't be enough
D	no
B	to let all the lorries through
D	I know
B	so
D	mm
C	there are some massive
D	mm
C	lorries now aren't there?
A	yeah
C	the supermarket ones
A	that's right
D	I don't know really how it's all got like that all come to that one point
A	it's too complicated at that point isn't it?
D	mm
C	mm
B	mm I mean er have to go quite some way out of your way to find another crossing over that
D	I know but
B	you know
D	it seems to me
A	mm
D	someone who this plaque was to someone called George Hudson who had a lot to do with the railways
A	mm
D	and he said all railways make them go to
A	mm
C	mm
D	well I think that er idea struck on and when they build a new road round here make it go
A	mm
D	to the railway and so you've got all these roads
A	mm
D	one two three four at least and the railway and
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about the new idea,that is it really good or not	Entailment
A	mm
D	the bridge and the
A	mm
D	coming to the same
A	mm I know
D	point
A	point
D	as though
A	yeah
D	er
C	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about the way they are going through	Neutral
D	that is it
A	mm
D	so you don't need planning
C	well they
D	and you'll end up like that
C	I always think if you
D	now if they are going to put another road in it'll go to there
[ANNOTATION]	they are discussing about the plan of the roads	Entailment
A	mm mm
D	but where else can it go?
A	I don't know
D	it can't can it?
A	no
D	and
C	but when you think of the emergency services
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure about the plan and there is no specific way for emergency services	Neutral
C	you know if
A	yeah
C	everybody's stuck at the
A	well the fire engine place is down there
D	yeah
D	well
[ANNOTATION]	the plan is not good enough	Entailment
C	yeah
D	in
B	mm
D	er we have bridges we've
A	er
D	er but anyhow if there's a ship
[ANNOTATION]	Not everything is including in the plan	Entailment
A	mm
D	coming up the river
B	okay yes
D	it cuts
B	mm
D	they had to let the fire engine know
B	yes
D	and it would go across to the other side
A	they wouldn't be able to get across it
A	so you want to divide the fire engines up?
D	mm
A	mm
D	so they had to put
A	yeah
D	mm mm
B	I mean it's not impossible to get to the side without going that over that crossing but it's a good couple of miles out of your way
D	yeah well
A	and I don't know the route
D	that's another thing
D	not everyone knows the route
C	that makes it difficult
A	is it that
B	mm yes it is
D	yes you would think that er
A	mm
D	er
A	that's why it hasn't been done I think
D	well
C	mm
D	yes you see
A	know what the answer is
D	there isn't one is there
A	not really
D	well you could say let's look at it this way what is it? is it the roads that's messing it up? is it the railway that's messing it up? is it the railway that has to do something?
A	I think even if the railway wasn't there it would still be a bad corner
D	well it would mm maybe worse actually
A	mm
D	I don't know
A	you could still never get out of that street that Asda's on can you?
D	no
A	mm
D	very difficult
A	mm
C	did you get those twigs out of the car
D	did I get sweetheart?
C	twigs
D	yes I've got them
C	oh right
D	and they're over at this side
C	oh right
D	and he's got the tie wraps
C	mm
D	which
C	does he need any help with them?
D	I don't know
C	do you need any help with those doing the
B	er
C	tree?
B	I don't know
C	well go and look at the tree
A	they might be able to get them on
C	yes
A	then we get them
C	yeah
A	mm
C	I think you'd have to get a
A	mm
C	say do you want them
A	mm
C	and then that's the difficult bit isn't it?
C	mm
A	if you run out you run out till
C	mm
A	next year because
C	mm
A	I don't know where else you would get them even in another country if you went to say
C	no
A	yeah soft fruits some
C	mm
D	what was that
C	Poland used to have a lot of strawberries
D	mm
C	didn't they?
D	well
C	mm
D	they for their jams they got their strawberries from Poland
A	mm
D	mm
A	yeah some of the frozen ones soft fruits come from Poland
D	because in the er First World War
A	the men
D	men the ordinary ranks they got plum jam
A	oh right
D	but the officers got strawberry jam
A	oh right
D	mm
A	mm
D	you know because they knew that a band er and that er their music really cheered everybody up and was good for the morale and that and he he bought like Ticklers jam bought these instruments mm
A	and did the band get going?
D	yes yes
A	mm
D	well in those days a lot of people er
A	mm
D	I mean today we could almost say the instrument most people play now is a guitar isn't it?
A	mm
D	whereas
A	mm
D	they've got er well everything er to the old er well the
C	well we've got three brass bands I can think of straight away round here there's the Salvation Army
D	is there? mm
C	there's the
D	yes
A	mm
C	and there's the
D	yes
A	mm
D	so where's this
B	well that's a band for
D	mm
D	we pass Salvation Army
A	yeah
D	on the way back don't we?
A	yes
D	mm
A	so it's still quite popular round
C	mm
A	here
D	mm
C	does
A	no
C	no
A	it's in the rugby club car park
C	oh yeah?
A	and it is really so
B	a bit
C	no
A	atmosphere it's usually windy and there's plastic bags flown about and it
C	oh
A	think I don't want anything
C	I used to enjoy going there
A	and kind of slide off without being noticed
A	whereas before it used to sound really
C	mm
D	mm
A	we used to look like a jigsaw puzzle from the nineteen fifties with the
C	mm
A	swing boats and the
C	mm
A	bunting up and the band and
C	mm yeah
A	it was good
D	the coconut shy
A	yeah and horse rides and vicar in his straw hat and
C	mm
A	all that sort of thing but like
D	yeah
A	a long time ago now
C	mm
A	a tea tent and
C	which he was he was a one-off wasn't he?
A	yeah
D	I mean
A	that's it
D	but these things
C	and when he goes it seems to you know absolutely
A	it's not the same is it?
C	no no
A	nobody else is going to get up at five o'clock that's why and start setting up trestle tables and moving
C	yeah
A	stuff from where it's been
C	yeah
A	held and there's a
D	going round and chivvying
A	yeah
D	people I mean I think some of the tables came from the Catholic church
A	yeah
D	mm
A	that's it just used everything that there was and very
D	well you see
A	well supported
C	mm
A	very
C	yes
D	it won't come back
C	of course
A	oh no it can't
D	mm it's like our memories now isn't it
C	mm
D	you know we've some cherished memories of different things and er er they've been and they've gone
A	yeah
D	mm and nothing really
A	do have the benefit of them
C	mm
D	mm
A	no things change don't they and
D	mm
A	usually people don't want to put in that kind of effort
C	no that's true
A	so it's not as good
D	well that's it there was a lot of er volunteers who used to
A	mm
D	go around and
A	mm
D	do this that the other and whatever
C	the games that's right yeah
D	and er weighing the cake and er
C	yes
D	er other things
B	and a few raspberries
A	yeah
C	mm
A	yeah
C	but we're we're going to erm the library erm
A	oh yes
C	party well it's it's
D	mm
C	yeah
A	for the hundred year
C	mm
A	party yes
C	mm
D	I've got the tickets
C	yes and it's on the twenty-first is it?
D	it's
C	or
D	it's a Saturday
C	twenty-sixth
A	mm
C	is it?
D	twentieth and
A	who was saying how come they build it when the war was on? or who was building it? I thought all the chaps would have been fighting
D	well there was things going on before then and after
A	well it must have been two thousand and fifteen so that's during
D	oh you mean in two thousand
A	nineteen fifteen
C	mm
D	exactly then?
A	nineteen fifteen
C	mm
A	it must have been
D	mm
A	if its centenary is now
C	mm
D	for the for the
A	the library
D	the library
A	I thought you said it was a hundred years old
D	well that's what they said weren't it?
C	mm
A	so that makes it nineteen fifteen
C	mm
D	mm
A	doesn't it?
C	yeah
D	mm
A	so how come that means they must have been building during nineteen fourteen and
C	mm
A	nineteen fifteen presumably
D	yeah well er
C	mm
D	yeah that war wasn't like this this last war
A	oh
D	that First World War
A	mm
D	you know visit them
A	mm
C	mm
D	didn't they
C	yes
D	mm
C	but that's a bit old-fashioned you know because there are so many volunteers
A	yeah
C	and erm you know they they make a big effort don't they?
D	mm
C	you know the plants
A	mm
C	I mean there's hundreds of plants at the beginning isn't there?
D	yeah
C	er you know when it's a
D	in fact when I was there this this
C	oh yeah
D	you know head
D	Indian I think actually
A	mm
D	er she said when I got are you coming
C	yes yes
D	mm that seems to have gone quickly doesn't it?
C	mm
D	it were eight weeks ago wasn't it when
C	yes
D	mm
C	comes round eventually
D	mm
C	oh the year's gone hasn't it?
A	yes
C	not
A	no about three weeks I think yeah mm
D	have you got it er where you're going now then? you got it planned?
A	what holidays?
D	yeah your holidays mm
A	erm
A	I think it's going to be Italy
D	mm
A	near the end of September
D	mm
A	yeah
D	so how will you go out with your
A	don't know
D	are you affected by pasta? cos that's what it they they mainly
D	mm can you have pasta here?
A	I haven't for some time
B	well
A	because it contains egg
B	pasta is it's a bit of a tricky thing
C	mm
B	pasta can be just durum wheat and water
C	mm
B	which tastes that would fulfil all the requirements it matches typically er made in the south of Italy but if you're in the north of Italy they do pasta a bit differently and they throw an egg in as well
C	mm
D	they're made with egg
C	egg
B	durum wheat
D	egg or and water
C	which
D	so
A	supposed to have it
D	that could be a problem then
A	mm
B	potentially
D	mm
A	I'm having a little bit more now aren't I so
C	mm yeah that's good
A	mm
B	I mean going on holiday it's it's not easy it's sort of
D	no
B	a bit
D	no yeah and furthermore
B	mm
A	mm
D	you've got a bit of bun on your nose
A	ah
D	I shouldn't eat it just in case it isn't
A	have you caught it?
B	think so
D	but you can just just with your water er drink a change of drinking water
A	mm
D	it can I mean for example er Sheffield area is is very soft water here we're hard water
A	mm
D	mm
A	mm
C	mm it is
D	mm?
A	mm
D	and when er our
A	mm
D	would have a good weren't they
C	mm
D	I said
B	mm it's like that in Greece
D	is it?
B	mm
D	mm
B	mm
B	sleepers er
C	oh
C	mm
B	I mean thirty-six hours from Paris to Moscow is not bad
D	what for price?
B	thirty-six hours it takes
D	yeah
B	thirty-six hours from Paris to
D	mm but how much does that cost like?
B	well they give twenty-five percent discount if your birthday is within a certain number of days from your departure
D	mm
B	but it's about erm four hundred pounds return
A	is that right?
D	mm
A	what difference does that make when your birthday is?
B	well it's just an offer
C	mm
C	somebody's thought about it's a good idea
D	well no have you seen that advert with the meerkats?
A	I try not to
D	you know the meerkats?
A	mm
B	mm
D	mm and they're going along and they're in Hollywood aren't they in this and he's driving and he he breaks up but he's he's hit who has he hit
C	no
A	mm
D	mm
C	erm
D	and he said what we can do is we can give some free meerkat tickets for the cinema two tickets for and of course they've knocked this guy down
C	it's Schwarzenegger isn't it?
D	mm?
C	it's Arnold
D	Schwarzenegger
C	Schwarzenegger
D	mm you know that big chap? spilt all his coffee and that over his er mm and er they have to do a quick about turn but er
C	mm
B	the first?
C	a first class ticket on the train
B	erm when we went from York to Edinburgh
C	that was it
A	mm
B	yes
C	and it was was erm such a small amount wasn't it?
D	mm
B	yes
A	the difference yes
C	yeah
A	sometimes it is
B	yes I mean even erm I remember I went to London once it was actually a few pounds cheaper
C	yeah
B	to travel first class than second
A	mm don't know how they work it out
C	I don't know I don't know how they
B	well what happen is if you think there's like ten different well it's more than ten but just erm for illustration purposes ten different prices so there might be
C	yeah
B	twenty tickets at five pounds and then at five pound increments etcetera so if they'd sold I don't know a hundred erm second class tickets for that train that might be in band five twenty-five pounds but if for example first class starts at ten but they haven't got many booking first class
A	mm
B	it'll still be at the ten pound carry but if there's lots of bookings in second class that will potentially be a higher band
C	yeah
A	oh mm
C	normally
A	mm
B	it's all about booking it in a really far in advance for
C	mm
B	that sort of journey
C	mm
B	I mean I remember once all three of us did
C	oh
D	you'll have seen to that then
A	mm
D	you will have seen to that
B	yes it's
D	mm
B	but the
C	uhu
A	mm easier isn't it?
C	mm it is it's easier than plane isn't it?
A	mm
D	mind you though
C	what?
D	don't always get a seat do you?
C	no
D	and you see them crowded aren't they some of them
C	well yeah
D	mm
C	mm
B	I would say that's generally more the sort of
D	yeah
B	are more crowded because
A	mm
B	it's Intercity or Eurostar it's usually a reservation is compulsory
C	mm
D	it compulsory reservations?
B	yes
A	mm
D	mm
C	mm
D	no standing on Eurostar then?
B	no
C	mm
B	but I think that's more to do with safety than anything else
C	mm
D	I would say so mm
B	and you can't stand for two hours so
C	mm mm
D	oh
C	mind it's years and years ago
C	but mm
D	mm
C	we've been twice in the erm the carriage
D	the guard's van
C	the guard's van
D	mm
C	just standing and we stood with your mother when she was a baby
D	teething I believe
C	yes
D	mm
A	yeah
C	but you've no you've nowhere to lean against really it
B	mm
C	you know I mean if if you went you know round the edge you know the you were just swaying
B	it's tempting to go on the train to Italy
A	mm
B	tempting
A	mm
C	how would you do that
B	it's a bit complicated
C	yeah
B	erm if you want to get you can do
C	oh
A	mm
C	yeah
B	but
D	you're there that's Italy you've arrived that's it it's Italy
B	yes but when because we're wanting to be a bit further south than sort of Tuscany
C	mm
B	it's we can't do that in one day from
C	oh right
B	so if you wanted to do Tuscany you would
C	oh right
B	but essentially the journey would be would be to Paris and then there's a train from Paris to Milan on TGV
C	oh right
B	and then the Italian
C	mm
B	Eurostar services
C	but you'll go by plane will you?
B	it's probably it's likely yes
C	mm
B	I might try the train going and the plane coming back but
C	mm
B	I'm I think the train both ways would be just a bit tricky because
C	mm
B	some sad reason really there seems to be a bit of tension between the French railway operator and the Italian railway operator
C	oh yeah
B	so it means the Italian railway operator have given er the French their er operator very poor slots
C	oh yeah
B	so it's
C	mm
B	just hasn't
C	mm bit tricky
B	not too good I'm afraid
C	mm
B	and only three services a day as well so
C	oh yeah
B	but it does take seven hours and two minutes
C	does it?
B	yes
C	yeah
B	Paris to Milan
C	mm
B	but it can only go about twenty miles per hour in the Alps because it's
C	oh yeah
B	such a steep gradient
C	yes mm
B	well I'm hoping to erm just spend about two of the well three nights in Florence
C	mm
B	because we didn't see the Boboli Gardens
C	mm
B	and I mean how far I'd like going south the Vasari Corridor and the Pitti Palace
C	oh yes
B	yes er so that would be the days er
C	mm
B	and then it's basically just seeing little smaller sites
C	mm
B	in the countryside and er Tuscany and Umbria
C	mm
B	and er probably the first stop would be Arezzo erm and then probably move towards the east coast
C	uhu
B	er could be er city
C	been there
B	that's
C	yeah mm
C	mm
A	mm
C	as much as that?
B	I think mum is a bit shy
A	yeah
D	we did seven cities there didn't we?
C	yes we did yes
D	mm
B	seven?
D	we did seven cities
B	seven cities yes
D	in Italy on our trip we did
B	yes
D	Siena er Venice
B	yes
D	Verona
B	mm
D	San Gimignano
B	San
D	Assisi
B	Rome presumably?
D	Rome
B	yes
D	mm
B	er
D	certainly wandered around didn't we?
C	mm
B	yes that's good
C	mm
C	we saw some wondering things didn't we?
D	we did mm
C	wonderful churches and
D	mm
C	all sorts mm
B	mm
C	anyway it's a good job we did them when we could
D	absolutely
C	mm
D	mm
B	something to think about
C	mm
C	mm
C	mm
B	one thing is er hope er if we do fly it will be from Luton and that's not easy to get to from
D	mm
B	this area I know it's north London
C	oh right
C	it's not really properly connected
C	on isn't it?
B	with any trains or buses or anything
C	oh
B	well probably take the train to
C	yeah
B	take a train from
D	to where?
B	to
C	Luton
B	Luton Airport
D	Luton Airport mm
C	mm
B	er hopefully just the flight times are going to be sensible er
C	oh
B	should be able to do it in that same morning
C	oh right that's good yeah
B	I've planned because
C	yeah
B	airport hotel stays
D	mm
C	oh yes
D	mm
C	yeah
D	yeah you
B	yeah
D	mm
B	but if it was the Eurostar we would need a night in Ashford the night before
C	oh would you?
B	it could be London the advantage of Ashford is that you can get up a little bit later because the train's got to travel from London to Ashford
C	oh yeah yeah
B	so that just gives you an extra I think it's forty-eight minutes er
C	mm
B	it's worth having definitely
C	mm it is in the morning
B	I know
C	mm
B	twenty minutes so it would be five thirty
C	yeah
B	so you'd probably have to get up at five
C	mm
C	mm
B	yes
C	yeah
B	it's a shame because it would technically be possible to do
C	no no they don't
B	no
C	work in with each other
B	no
C	no
B	the last train of the day from Milan leaves about twenty minutes before the Paris train arrives
C	oh that's bad organisation
B	it is
C	yeah
A	yeah
C	okay
C	oh right Speedy Gonzales
B	it looks like we're going to be in Italy during a pork festival
C	pork?
B	yes a festival of pork
C	oh
A	but will they have any porky pies
B	I don't know
B	I think it would be more well this
A	hog roast
B	particular time on the
C	oh
C	yeah
B	it is
C	mm
A	mm
B	I always find it very salty don't you?
A	mm and leathery
A	fatty
C	oh
A	spicy
C	yeah
A	well not too much to recommend it
A	but I like the price
B	it's not nearly as
A	thinly
A	mm so
B	yeah
A	you don't want too much
C	mm
A	mm
C	big big
A	yeah
C	dishes of it you know on a hot plate
C	just just spaghetti and er
A	oh yes
C	yeah just something maybe with it or like tomato erm I don't know
A	oh
C	everybody died for it but I thought well once you've had a quite a dish of spaghetti
A	mm
C	you don't want much else do you?
A	no that's
C	mm
A	like Yorkshire pudding and
C	mm
A	suet pudding so you don't eat
C	mm
A	as much meat
C	I think so
A	mm
B	did you have pasta too much before then? or
C	no
C	I know the first time we I did erm spaghetti bolognaise it was that didn't go down very well
A	mm
C	but if I do a mince now I I do a second day with spaghetti bolognaise
A	mm
C	and we've got
A	yes
C	have you been out today?
A	I just went in the car to get some strawberries and
C	oh yeah
A	it's
