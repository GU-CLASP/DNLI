B	mm
A	so do you wanna know where I went today?
B	yes where did you go today this afternoon?
A	erm I went basically out to see the People at Work photography exhibition which was advertised as being at the
B	okay
A	and erm it was er nine photographers were asked to take photos of people at work
B	okay
A	erm and the purpose behind it seems to be to dispel the idea that industry in Britain is dead
B	right
A	and it might've been because nobody could find it
B	okay so you and you believed this person?
A	okay
B	mm
A	cos it wasn't terribly well labelled
B	wouldn't you have just
A	well the
B	well when you
A	yeah
B	said that you know aboutthe second floor I was
A	it's very very big and you you know we've been there before there's you know it's big enough to
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about school	Contradiction
A	there's huge er installations in it
B	yeah it's poor isn't it?
A	anyway I didn't go straight there because erm I I I went on the three sixty and when I got off the bus I was outside the
B	oh right
A	and the tin pots do you remember when the Argentinian protest they always took out pots and pans?
B	yeah the noise they made coming down the street wow
A	mm
B	we used them over here as well did we or not?
A	no I don't think so I think they I think they've been erm repeated elsewhere in the world but I don't think they've been used in the UK
B	mm
A	so erm and there was quite a bit to read about that you know sort of
B	mm yeah
[ANNOTATION]	they are not sure where is it used	Neutral
A	wasn't a very explanation er
B	is that like it's funny the museum I've
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about weather	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	or which you know?
A	erm what was interesting was the queue to get in the
B	oh was it?
A	really big but
B	they people take their kids there more don't they?
A	yeah but you'd think people would take their kids to the
B	yeah I thought it was
A	yeah
B	there's things they can
A	interactive displays and yeah there's lots
[ANNOTATION]	person A not sure about interactive displays	Neutral
B	displays yeah sure
A	but I suppose a lot of children like dinosaurs don't they and
B	yeah it's got
A	erm anyway when I went into the
B	where is that?
[ANNOTATION]	they are talking about book	Contradiction
A	it's actually in the
B	on in the
A	yeah
B	oh
A	you know lots of people doing the same thing
B	I have some remembrance of doing this as
A	mm
B	to watch a certain
A	well when we were kids didn't we have those plastic glasses that would be one red
B	type of thing
A	and that was meant to do something
B	mm
A	I mean really it's it it it makes you jump the
[ANNOTATION]	They remember the glasses the other person is talking about.	Entailment
B	is it?
A	the an owl flew out of the screen pretty
B	mm mm
A	early on and you know and it's you know it really did feel very very close you know erm and erm
B	mm
A	and they erm the serious astronomers all work in the desert in Chile
B	yeah
A	a
B	sure
[ANNOTATION]	They think that there was a bird that was flying.	Entailment

B	pictures of what?
A	erm galaxies and you know erm
B	oh right
A	erm the I it wasn't
[ANNOTATION]	They think that a small telescope can work as well.	Neutral
B	it must be fantastic that sort of this mustn't it?
A	yeah the I mean my only complaint really was that it wasn't very well explained
B	mm mm
A	it was like you know here's one where the star's exploded and it didn't really tell you
B	mm
A	why or how and you know the
[ANNOTATION]	They think that stars exploding are bad.	Contradiction
B	does it matter it's only just?
A	probably not I mean it was it was more visual impact than explaining
B	yeah
A	you know the science behind it but I
B	big ALMA
[ANNOTATION]	They think that studying space is important.	Entailment
A	because they can't see erm
B	wasn't that the name of Ray Moore's wife big big Alma?
A	Ray Moore the radio

A	yes and there was an Alma on Coronation Street as well
B	he had a
A	so I can thoroughly recommend erm a 3D experience
B	mm
A	erm
B	there are 3D actual movies made now aren't there?
[ANNOTATION]	3D movies is a thing from the future that we will not be able to experience for many years.	Contradiction
A	oh yeah yeah
B	and do people sit with
A	yeah
B	as I say they tried this years and years forty years ago nearly
A	yeah but I don't think they had the
B	yeah
A	erm the the the the techniques would've been very erm basic and crude
B	mm yeah no it was the way it was pretty underwhelming then quite frankly
[ANNOTATION]	Even though the technology was basic, it was amazing to see it.	Contradiction
A	yeah
B	yeah
A	and also the IMAX experience as well is cos
B	the height the screen is
A	the height of the screen yeah
B	was it?
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A has gone to the cinema last week but their experience was not as good as other times.	Neutral
A	enormous yeah
B	so what room is is you know is it where is it actually?
A	on the second floor of the
B	for but you'd think it you say it's the height of all that
A	yeah
B	you know how come it's? er are those
A	well maybe it goes down you know
B	mm
A	it it might be like the edge of the building or something like the whole of the erm you know I dunno
B	yeah
A	but it's very it's enormous
B	mm
[ANNOTATION]	A was not on the first floor of the cinema.	Entailment

A	but I looked and I
A	and I
B	mm
A	and I couldn't wouldn't have been able to get across the road and down to the bus stop so I decided I was gonna race this three sixty to
B	on the tube
A	on the tube yeah so I thought if if the three sixty's got to sort of contend with traffic
B	mm
A	you know I thought I could probably beat it if I
B	but you were not right
A	mm
B	you saw it in disappear into the distance
A	yeah when I came out of
A	so
B	thought a bus good bus will always get a good tube will always beat a good bus
A	yeah but you
B	oh sure yeah I mean you were stood to get a a distance to walk to
A	the museums back to back to
B	I know it's bloody yeah long time I used to go in there years ago
