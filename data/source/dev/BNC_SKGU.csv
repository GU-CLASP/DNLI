A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	you know what I mean? we're the bully in the playground sort of thing
A	yeah
B	where
A	that's what we were saying yeah
B	sometimes history and tradition does drag you back
A	we've got the brand but we don't use we don't use it as much as we should
B	no
A	which is what we're trying to do now
B	no
A	we're trying to get more
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	according to speaker b, tradition brings you forward	Contradiction
B	bits they should be
A	in a way it's even more with
B	yeah
B	no that's right
A	yeah exactly even though they've got no idea where the fuck it is they're still like oh yeah
B	they've heard of
A	with
B	yeah but I mean
A	mm
B	because you've got
A	it's just nicer
B	you've got the
[ANNOTATION]	they do not know where that is	Entailment
B	but
A	yeah
B	in two thousand and thirteen
A	mm
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b mentioned a year	Entailment
B	and I need you to help me project manage me
A	I can do mum but you have to want to do it
B	I'm not
A	the problem why projects fail is human intervention and human failings
B	I know well that's what I want I want
A	erm I have something on Sunday but then nothing apart from that
B	but you haven't got anything on on Saturday?
A	no why?
B	could you come over?
A	mm
B	help me
A	I don't need you to pay me
B	I do want to pay you
A	fine
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b will pay speaker a for their help	Entailment
B	mm
B	but it
A	yeah no that's fine I'll do it for you
B	I just wanna I just wanna
[ANNOTATION]	speaker a is refusing to help	Contradiction
A	but you need to keep it clean
B	I know
A	every every time I come over I clean your bloody and it looks disgusting again
B	I know I know I know I know I know I know
A	yeah
B	did you like that garage anyway?
A	yeah I know it's very beautiful but they
[ANNOTATION]	speaker b is aware of how dirty it is	Entailment
B	doesn't include delivery doesn't include this
A	yeah it doesn't add
B	well I've found another one where it does include delivery for that price
A	and it's just like why are you charging me to deliver something I'm paying eighty thousand pounds for you jammy bastards?
B	mm
A	like fuck you
A	yeah I think if you rang them up and negotiated you'd say like we really like this but
A	then they they
A	it's a sale at the end of the day and they they wanna sale
B	and the thing is
A	but it's just it's I think it just needs to be done
B	well this is what I said to him I said what I want to do
A	yeah you can do that can't you?
B	you know he can do his own breakfast
A	yeah that's fine
B	so I while he's doing that
A	mm
B	but I need to do that every day
A	apparently it takes twenty-one days to create a routine
B	well
A	I can't do that mum
B	well give me the tools
A	I will but you've gotta do it
B	give me the tools alright?
A	it's as simple as having a spreadsheet and ticking off the days you go
B	right well you have to you have to help me
A	I will but you need to do
B	good
A	yeah I know I'm trying mum but you
B	no you can't physically push me but you can set me a schedule
A	yeah
B	you can
A	mm
B	you can actually make it into two separate little areas like you'll have the shower room and the bed up one end
A	yeah
B	and then
A	yeah
B	and like
A	yeah yeah yeah
B	that's only four hundred quid
A	he doesn't need it that big
B	no no no he doesn't need it quite that big but he can have
A	yeah
B	and
A	that's what I
B	and he can have like like the woman you know the
A	mm
B	and and things like this
A	yeah
B	exactly
A	he could even have the one of
B	and and
A	it's got to be his space
B	it's got to be his space absolutely
B	no no no no he's got to cos he's gotta
A	but he needs that space and you need that space as well
B	yeah
B	so
A	so then he if he wants to go watch TV instead of sitting in
B	yeah
A	he can he obviously can sit in your living room but if he sits in his living room it's his domain and his space
A	yeah
B	they're about four hundred pounds each but
A	yeah yeah
B	and so he can have those on in his room
A	yeah but how expensive is that?
B	it's not expensive because you they they
A	oh
B	and they keep it at twenty-two
A	yeah
B	kick in but
A	yeah yeah yeah true
B	you know his money
A	oh no
B	jesus christ that home last week
A	and that makes it smell even more
B	oh
B	the heat just
A	yeah
B	absolutely
A	I just I can imagine it being so nice it would be so
B	and the other thing
A	it'll be so much better
B	the other thing we'll do is we'll put a very cheap laminate on the floor
A	yeah like a wooden laminate
B	a a yeah
A	some of the ones we saw in Wickes last week weren't expensive I didn't think
A	yeah
B	but
A	yeah yeah
B	I just
A	room his room
B	but
A	yeah
B	he can kick it up to that
A	yeah
B	on
B	erm
B	at the weekend we normally set it at eighteen
A	mm
B	much warmer
A	but it's it's just
B	oh god
A	and the thing is
B	mm
A	I said I rang dad
B	mm?
A	you can have a day where you like if I even if I did it twice a month or once a month
B	yeah
A	you've still got a Friday where you can go out shopping or you can go out for a
B	mm
A	and I could just like I just need to sit there I just need to be there
B	no I don't think he'd care either
A	cos he knows that I do my job so
B	if you're on the internet and you're connectable
A	exactly
B	it doesn't matter does it?
A	and that's the point like it doesn't matter if I work from my house your house I can work from home and just sit with
B	I've got to have it yeah
A	so I think that works really well as well
B	mm
A	if I can work from home on Fridays
B	yeah
A	mm
B	and I used to make meals for
A	yeah
B	not
A	yeah yeah yeah yeah
B	and that made life a lot easier because although we were eating
A	yeah
B	and I said to
A	do you
A	you can eat with
B	he's not
A	he is he has lost a lot of weight
B	he looks old
A	he looks fine I think he looks okay but I don't think he should lose any more
A	yeah
B	it's that he has smaller meals but he has
A	yeah
B	he eats a lot of
A	mm
B	and I think that's where he's going wrong
A	yeah
B	he needs more protein
A	I love protein
B	so do I
A	yeah
B	individual pie dishes
A	yeah
B	six individual pies or whatever or what
A	Cornish pasty and vegetable and stuff it's a really nice meal
B	it's a meal yeah it's a proper meal
B	mm
B	and it doesn't cost a lot
A	yeah exactly I think he'll be I think he'll be fine and
B	mm
A	he was there all the time
B	yeah
A	and but if you haven't
[ANNOTATION]	Cornish pasty and vegetable makes a good cheap meal.	Entailment
B	yeah
A	you
B	no and I said to I said to
A	yeah
B	we'll knock and say you know are you alright dad? or whatever
[ANNOTATION]	Cornish pasty and vegetable is quite an advance and expensive meal.	Contradiction
A	yeah no you need a you need a baby alarm or a baby monitor
B	yeah
A	because you know how many times when he
B	mm
A	when he came to you and you could hear him going to to the bathroom and you can hear him like going like oh like
B	mm
A	I know he's not not purposely moaning but he is moaning and you've got to make sure that he's okay
B	mm
A	yeah not moving yeah
B	so I've got that little blue
A	do you think?
B	mm
A	you're gonna have to
B	yeah I'll have to have a path
A	shed
[ANNOTATION]	Speaker A bought their baby monitor when they got pregnant.	Neutral
B	oh yeah
A	oh yeah true
B	because of the fact that
[ANNOTATION]	They will need a path.	Entailment
A	yeah
B	so we've got to have a path from the car to there anyway
A	true
B	we told them to have their bathroom done and they didn't
A	yeah
B	so if she argues about this I will say to her what about the ten thousand for the car?
A	mm
B	I will and if
A	no
[ANNOTATION]	They had their bathroom done when speaker B asked them to.	Contradiction
B	and I think your father's idea about
A	yeah
B	two or three
A	or in like an
B	yeah
A	I don't
B	but yeah I can't deal with it and I
A	but that apparently it just needs to be sorted I think dad
[ANNOTATION]	It is useless to have a baby monitor or alarm.	Contradiction
B	I know
A	no there's no point saying you know because you know because you haven't done it
B	no I know
A	but then if
B	if she turns around and says well he caused me so much problem that I had to have it done
A	fuck off did he?
B	yeah exactly
A	it was leaking before he even arrived
B	I know
A	she can't take she wouldn't've been able to take it out of his bank account without you knowing anyway
B	well I've asked her for the accounts and she won't give them to me
A	well then she'll give them to dad won't she?
B	yeah she'll have to
A	and anyway grandad wouldn't know if
B	well he
A	it's fraud
B	well
B	so I could claim that
A	I don't think they cannot if we're doing it to benefit him
B	no they could do because it says it
A	car yeah
B	er
A	now we're even
B	so we're even
A	fuck off
B	and
A	in
B	and that's what right that's what that
A	it's your own fault
B	well no it's not gonna add any value on because we then have to turn around and pay out of our own
A	yeah
A	well no that was you
B	no it's not
A	no he said about the partition
B	but he's the one who
A	but you're not poor
B	we're not poor
A	no but I think you're okay at the moment
A	you're not poor
B	what that brown one?
A	who needs four handbags?
B	I had a lovely little black one and your father threw it out
A	who needs four handbags mother?
B	I do
A	exactly
B	you need one
A	well no I don't I've got pockets
B	oh lovely
A	so I've got one of those to give you
A	no yeah

A	I know
B	mm
A	cos we unlocked it
B	mm
A	erm
B	oh fuck off
B	but what he's doing is he's using you
A	I know I think that as well
B	of course it does
A	and of course it yeah I was like of course it does
B	mm
A	you drove me home when I was crying you go above and beyond what any other friend has done for me I was like
B	but you better keep me then
A	but you have to understand that I will not put up with him speaking about me like that it's really upset me because it was personal
B	mm
A	and she said
B	think about it?
A	yeah
B	bizarre
A	I know I was like
A	I'm not dealing with it anymore
A	it's like he's a bully
