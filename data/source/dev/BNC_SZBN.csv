A	well
B	oh yeah
A	but
B	right okay
A	how do you feel about going on your own?
B	well that's alright what I might do is I'm fairly certain she's not interested in going I might ring up
A	she was a bit dismissive about going to a farm wasn't she?
B	she was yes yes so that might
A	oh yes
[ANNOTATION]	There are many cows in the farm.	Neutral
B	yeah
A	have you given up on your group discounts?
B	yeah I do I contacted European rail and the group discount was not a you can't save any money you marginally save something on Eurostar but nothing on German railways in fact I've got a cheaper fare on German railways going by a different route than they seem to be get be able to get
A	oh okay
B	well this will be down to London Eurostar to Paris across Paris well cross it's only a few hundred yards
A	oh which stations?
B	you come into Paris Nord and go out of Paris Est and they are only a few hundred yards apart apparently according to our sources
[ANNOTATION]	The European rail starts from Portugal and reaches to Russia.	Neutral
A	Nord
B	well I've got maps of Paris
A	and I
A	because we were going down to
B	but fine yeah
A	and it seemed quite a long walk but I mean it was a doable walk because I had
B	no
A	are you thinking of a wheelie case?
B	oh yeah I'll be taking a wheelie case
A	mm
B	erm
A	tomorrow well that rather
A	erm what I think I might do today you're promising me sunshine aren't you?
B	well that's what the weather forecast yesterday says I'll check it in a few minutes
A	it's quite early yet it might it might erm
[ANNOTATION]	The Paris maps are geographical.	Neutral
B	yeah it said by the middle of the day it was going to be twenty-two degrees
A	well it was pretty warm by yesterday evening I mean warm for an evening
B	but brilliant sun as well the sky is still quite grey
[ANNOTATION]	The sun rises at 6:30 am currently.	Neutral
A	yeah
B	uhu
A	including travelling
B	right I'm
A	and then come back and do some more admin and if I can do any paperwork tidying up all to the good with a view to doing my washing in the late afternoon so to be out of your washing arena and then tomorrow set aside the whole day with thinking through what I need to take where and any extra time I get I can go I can continue filling up that recycling box I'm not short of things to do but I fear there may not be other time and I may have to pause that activity that's oh erm I might like to go to the the library as well tomorrow my only thoughts on the library tomorrow is that one of my books on its third renewal is erm
B	mm
A	I'll tell you the other thing that's really important that might take a bit of time is I ought to write to
[ANNOTATION]	The library closes in the afternoon.	Neutral
B	mm
A	mm
B	tomatoes to put in yeah I don't want to leave them particularly in the car all the morning while I'm at poetry so you could if I packaged them you could take them in yeah?
A	what? only if I go over on Monday
B	yeah yeah if you don't go on Monday
A	yes
B	knowing your knowing your population of snails
A	if you ever need them when they are over there do you know where to find them?
B	have you got some over there?
A	yes
B	oh I didn't know you had
A	erm if you go into my utility room and look on the shelves there's erm it's like an ice not an ice cream container erm the one that has the
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	right
A	I think it's on the shelf above where I keep the keys
B	right Tuesday erm when have I got to get you to the station?
A	yeah
B	leaving here at nine forty right okay
A	because because earlier is better for you because then you you you need to drop me off and I had a little thought about that actually because erm we can go to the disabled car park and put use my blue badge and then you could walk me we could or we could
B	well that's that's not a problem
A	yes and
B	badge yeah that's possible
A	otherwise I did check the front of the station and there are some dropping-off spaces we could try for one of those but as a fall back option possibly do that oh you know we were talking about libraries?
B	yeah yeah I know where they are
A	oh right oh well
B	I could do yeah it's not a problem
A	erm I think you might want some lunch so that's what we tried to
B	oh that's not a problem I can dance around that whatever
A	oh you could go to the erm sandwich shop for old times' sake
B	yeah
A	I don't know
B	I think I think the blue one is open but the old one is not open I don't think
A	erm
B	mm
A	yeah and that would enable me to have the card registered there erm in case because it's always useful I don't know what they'd
B	mm
A	the thing I wanted to tell you that came through on my
B	oh are they going to start charging?
A	a quid
B	yeah that's what they used to charge years ago
A	yes erm but I thought the free reservations were the pay-off for not giving us a choice of very much choice of library books and they said in order to maintain services we have to charge you a pound it wasn't just targeted at me saying because you have been overusing the service erm you can have
B	mm
B	well I don't know but trying to collect pounds off everybody when you do things online it presumably isn't simple
B	well no it just goes onto your account the same as your erm overdue charges doesn't it? if a book goes overdue you can log it in and it says you owe them money but you don't have to pay it then you can carry on taking books in and out but at some stage it starts blocking you and says give us the money and I'm sure that's how it will work because it's just an extension of that system then isn't it?
A	right
B	and I'm sure that's the system they used to use
A	sometimes they don't make you pay the the fine immediately do they?
B	no well that's your choice you can either pay immediately or defer it
A	yeah
B	mm
A	yeah but they seemed to think it was quite erm very good of me to pay the fine
B	yes
A	well you can go out to all the
B	well I suppose you can go out to the Peak District
A	I mean how far away is the
B	that's true
A	who knows?
B	mm
A	for example these big speakers especially when they are things that take two people to move
B	mm
A	oh I've got I've got a list of phone numbers of contacts for like furniture but specialist equipment that is used that is heavy bulky and only used in certain situations probably by a particular sort of person I'm going to see how
B	yeah
A	yeah not quite not quite I mean I don't think they'll be playing but I mean
B	oh right yeah yeah oh yeah
A	oh right I don't know
B	oh yeah you could take it there
A	but it says in the erm WhatsOn in somewhere well one of these things we get news things possibly the
B	oh
A	yeah
B	oh right okay you know it's not that charity again is it?
A	no no they well I don't think it is
B	they got their fingers burnt because they ended up with so much stuff
A	no no they they just didn't they they used to come round
B	money yeah
A	but also when that happened they apparently allegedly didn't get everything they should do because somebody else came round in a white van and
B	helped themselves
A	yes
B	yeah yeah
A	erm but I mean at the moment the the way they're writing like you know you'd have to pay these people in white vans to take it away any way you look as though you need to hurry off now
B	mm
A	okay erm what time? do you think you'll
B	about eleven o'clock I think
A	oh okay so er that's a little while yet isn't it?
B	yeah
A	right catch up with you later then
B	right
