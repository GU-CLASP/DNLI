B	okay let's start again
A	I don't know if any of the other girls have been out to meet or them all here
B	no
A	have they? I
B	no cos you don't think there's a sense of community here do you unless
A	but they
B	well if you've got baby then yeah
A	no I mean the others with a baby
B	oh
A	where do they go? do they go out and see it
B	oh
A	but then I've been trying to practice my Chinese so it's a bit different to
B	yeah you have to be quite erm bold don't you really?
B	so
A	I'm not usually bold
B	yeah
A	they love it
A	I know
B	all over her
A	no there's only two
B	no she's got her behind her ear as well
A	really?
A	and there's me trying to do her sleep training going just go back to sleep come on
A	oh well we can't put the net up
B	the mosquito net?
A	yeah she was scared
B	well it didn't work when she was a baby like well she's still a baby but
A	she's just gonna be prodding it
B	yeah mm
A	mm
B	but do you think it would be a good thing for her to get used to
A	to get used to a mosquito net?
B	I mean we've only got mosquitos because we left the bathroom window open with the light on
A	yeah
B	and the problem is it let in about four hundred mosquitos
A	yeah we're lucky
B	I think
A	I think we're lucky
B	I think you got most of them in the bath so
A	did you see my god there was loads
B	yeah
A	like the whole bath was just covered like
B	yeah but you know what they're like
A	I've sprayed so much citronella in there now but I hosed them down with hot water like the whole of the shower unit
B	yeah
A	I just sprayed nearly the whole bathroom with hot water
B	but the trouble is the ones that got out of the bathroom and there's bound to be
A	yeah
B	quite a few that are just hidden
A	yeah there was
B	behind cupboards and shit so
A	ah oh wondered what that was there was a big black blob on her leg
B	so we'll find out tonight how many have er
A	oh
B	I won't be out for long I mean we're just gonna go for a meeting
A	oh that's alright I just need you to do a mosquito hunt just before
B	yeah
A	you go if we have time if we have time after this park trip
B	yeah
A	oh I can't get
B	don't think we can get out through there
A	I've gone the wrong way
B	so
A	every week woah it's up to you
B	what do I say to that?
A	well I don't know it's up to you
B	well no it isn't because
A	I say hello to everybody look
A	I don't care
B	no but it does it does matter because
A	well no but it's up to you
B	and if
A	I mean
B	yeah
A	well that'll be alright
B	then I'm more obliged well not obliged but I'd I'd like to do it more
A	well if it's do people smoke in
B	yeah
A	but I could come
B	you
A	too late for
B	yeah if if you could get a babysitter you could come and watch us
A	yeah then I don't mind getting paid with free cocktails I could just
B	yeah cos we'd probably get free drinks as well
A	get make sure that the nanny comes early in the morning oh you it would be at the weekend won't it?
B	erm the last two that we've done there have been on a Friday
A	yeah but I can't get really drunk and then just get the nanny to come
A	and stay babysit her on the night and then
B	mm well I don't think it's really that kind of venue anyway it's more kind of finish at
A	yeah
B	it's only cos like it got a bit out of hand last time
A	yeah
B	because they said free cocktails and
A	well I don't think if if
B	we got smashed
A	that's what happened I don't think they'll do it again will they?
B	well I don't think so no
A	you lost half the stuff you took with you
B	yeah well I lost my memory
A	no well that's I remember that
B	no I don't wanna do that
A	I don't but I didn't like that
B	so I'm you know if they say
B	we want you to play
A	you don't even know what you're doing
B	we give you free drinks then I'm not that
A	no
B	bothered
B	but if they can give us a percentage of what they take at the bar or something
A	what what the takings minus
B	cos then we can try and
A	how much the drinks cost?
B	yeah cos that's what they did in the the other bar that they were playing before
A	yeah
B	no they gave them like twenty percent of what they took at the bar
A	what without taking out the cost of the drinks?
B	drinks for who?
A	how does that work? no the drinks that the bar buys bottles and that the bar buys
B	oh I I don't know
A	the cost price just the profits
B	well the profit okay the ten percent of the profit they make
A	oh I wonder how much
B	so
A	a bar makes in profit
B	we could arrange I dunno
A	no er
B	if we could arrange some kind of deal like that
A	yeah yeah
B	because we bring along a load of people
A	yeah
B	like to
A	like your groupies
B	not groupies but our our friends as well
A	which way do we are we waiting for this one?
B	yeah this way
B	oh I dunno let's find out what he says anyway
A	bring your groupies
B	no you're not got a few groupies I suppose
B	in the Alan Partridge kind of sense
A	you're a little baby
B	how many cranes can you see?
A	well I can't even count them
B	there's hundreds okay
A	are we ready to go?
B	yeah
A	oh did you email
B	no I didn't
A	right
B	it will be easier just to say it them I think
A	yeah
B	than a really long email
A	well
B	don't know when I'll I'll see
A	did you check the meeting time?
B	no
A	are you just relying on me?
B	relying on you
A	cos I wouldn't rely on me if I was you I was hoping to rely on you for it
B	I'll I'll check them later
A	I half do a job and then get distracted and go and do something so
A	like if
A	otherwise I'll look at it and go oh right meeting at ten thirty oh
B	mm
A	cos I think I've read it but I haven't
A	I've only half read it
B	well it's cos playing on a Sunday as well
A	mm oh
B	and so if that takes out Fridays and Sundays
A	so many holes in the road twisting all my ankles
A	then I've only got Saturday at the weekend with you
A	well
B	and if I'm drinking on Friday I well I'll just have to
A	I
B	learn not to drink
A	yeah
A	well
B	waste my Saturdays cos of a hangover
A	but we've got we've got to be able to do some things that's all
B	yeah
A	if we're both gonna be working during

B	yeah
A	I don't want that to be Saturday cos that could be

B	yeah
A	plus you don't want it every week just what if we want to go to
B	yeah I know that's what I mean
A	like
B	well I suppose there's no point talking about this until I find out exactly what he wants so
A	yeah yeah okay
B	yeah
A	every week what are you gonna say?
B	cos I know the other guys they want as much as possible
A	do they?
B	yeah
A	what if they go away? I'm gonna have to go backwards
B	I'll lift you
A	thanks
B	oh ah
A	if I'd have gone backwards that wouldn't have been the wrong way wouldn't it?
A	right

B	yeah and then that's the last one
A	so but is there not a shortcut to the park here? how big is the
B	well no cos you can't get through that next road up there there's a
A	oh I didn't know
B	yeah cos
A	what that over there?
B	well
A	or over there
B	I don't know how far the next gap is in the road
A	right we'll play it safe today yeah? and then

A	yeah but we're going that way
B	yeah but we still have to cross the road

B	no
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
B	like a mini version of it
A	oh yeah
B	yeah
A	no I can't

A	New York
B	oh it is New York
A	a mini New York
B	in
[ANNOTATION]	Person B like this mini modeling of New York	Entailment
A	right
A	yeah well that's why you think the people are getting in the in our way but it's you they're just a lot slower
B	yeah
A	those bikes those e-bikes are
B	wait wait wait
A	they work pretty well
B	I'm waiting for the red light
A	those those e-bikes are erm
[ANNOTATION]	Person A think that those e-bikes work perfect	Neutral
B	two hundred and seventy?
A	but er but I think I think you can get one for about two hundred what do you think?
B	yeah well they had some in Metro
A	yeah oh yeah you were gonna tell me how much
B	like the ones that
[ANNOTATION]	Person B is going to dance	Contradiction
A	yeah maybe I'll take her to Metro we can ask her to come and have a look at some
B	but I I don't know what's a good e-bike I suppose the most important
A	well that's why
B	thing is the battery life
A	that's what I said to her I looked at well er with my translator on my
B	yeah
A	yeah
B	look at these buildings
[ANNOTATION]	Person B does not sure about the battery life for e-bikes	Entailment
A	but there's a Mcdonald's why I thought you said
B	yeah
A	it was over there
B	no we came out down there and wanted to cross the road down there
A	oh
B	where you've just wanted to cross but you can't
A	yeah I get you now I didn't get it before cos I always thought it was over the other side
B	no
A	I don't even like Mcdonald's so I wouldn't want to
B	no
A	buy a like
B	but after five pints it seemed like a good idea
A	is it twenty-four hour?
B	no it closes at eleven
A	beep beep yeah
B	oh it should get quieter now let's get away from the road
A	I I I'm very very tempted to get an e-bike

A	it's all so shiny
B	yeah there's no one here though really is there?
A	well but that will come
B	it's still
A	can I go on this path? are we going this way?
B	er cross over again though
A	why?
B	well cos there's nothing down there
A	that's where we're going
B	huh? that's not the park
A	yeah
B	the park's way over there
A	nah
B	okay let's go down there
A	no
B	come on
A	we'll do it your way
B	yeah do it your way
A	you know that it's fifty fifty however many times you get lost to to me
B	er
A	it is
B	it's like slightly higher than that
A	sixty forty maybe but there's
A	plenty of times where you take me one direction
A	and you're completely wrong

A	yeah
B	something to do
A	I've got other things
B	oh yeah

A	did they?
B	put some antlers on them
A	no cos they were for year of the horse that wasn't till February
B	oh was it? okay

B	oh that's why they've got horses
B	I don't know
A	they've done the same in the middle of town and in
B	er
A	you're you're right it does kind of hide the river doesn't it a bit actually although look at those children over there there is an entrance up there
B	er
A	there must be a shortcut there must be an exit up that side and it would be
B	that looks like a little road going into it there
A	yeah but on the way back maybe we should try and get to the other side
B	okay
A	and it it would be a shorter trip before you get to the park and start walking
B	yeah
A	you won't have to walk through that whole bit there
B	oh this road's terrible there's no traffic lights on this one
A	oh no
B	I think we just walk don't we?
