B	it'd be interesting to see how much interest I've had cos it's been sitting there for a long time without me going there it'll be a lot oh it will be
A	well we pop that in and then we thought we'd walk up to the cathedral

D	oh forgot you went somewhere if the little guy that I was talking to on the bus cos I got the bus
A	er no she was talking to someone on a bus she just was talking about do people still talk to others
D	yes cos the guy at the bus stop I was about to look what time the bus was coming and he said it was coming at half past and then he started talking on about the cathedral and he's erm a steward at the cathedral on Wednesday afternoons so that's where he's off to but he also works at the National Trust property
C	mm
D	and he's going to do something with fertilize the peaches on Sunday

B	talking of speaking to people on public transport
C	people were talking to on the tube do you remember when we went to watch Durham play?
B	yeah and then people are talking about how no one talks to each other in London transport completely different when we were there we were talking to one lady from Deptford who was going to the doctor's appointment
C	yeah
B	one lady who told us from Harrow
C	Harrow
B	told us how to get there that turned out to the be the worst possible way to get there in the world and there were other people
C	she started following us to make sure we were going that way
A	the way she said
C	you got to go that way
B	and you said just got to go to the toilet in Marylebone so I think it's not a complete truth that no one talks to each other on public transport
D	not a complete truth
C	I I just used to think it was a norm it can be annoying
D	oh very annoying
C	I seem to remember it was the norm when I was growing up
D	there was someone that was telling me that were annoying on a local bus near me which often
C	that's the hot spot
D	it is yeah if you get that bus
B	well you are lucky cos we don't actually get local buses where we are
D	oh yeah
A	we get one or two
B	precisely
D	a week
A	a week yeah
B	they get one every two minutes
C	doesn't the glamorous granny organize everyone or something
A	she wants everybody to get oh that one to
C	there's one direct from
B	no
A	yeah twice a month
C	I didn't know that
B	twice a month
D	twice a month
A	but it stops at
A	do you know how long they let you have two hours
B	that's a lot isn't it
A	that's a bit
B	that's too long that's two hours too much that anybody needs in
D	no
C	north
D	no if you reply on public transport like if you're elderly
B	I was reading in the erm
A	that's it
C	that's the one
B	go to
C	that's the one that was always there but at least they are advertising it
B	oh is it
A	twice a month to
B	and then you can go down to
C	oh I wouldn't recommend it
C	organises for sure
B	are you planning our return journey
C	yeah
D	I have to get the return bus before half past five because those little mini buses round
A	what are you inside?
D	a mini bus
A	like a fifteen seater
D	you know they do them every twenty minutes
A	yeah
D	erm and costs you a pound but you can get on and off as many times you want
A	one pound?
D	yeah
C	that's not is it
A	that's excellent
D	but they stop at half past five even in the summer which as the little man said on the bus is a problem because if people want to stay for evensong which is sung nicely
B	do you remember the
D	yes so people can't say if they need a lift back to the station
A	is there nothing else to the station?
D	nothing else up and down the hill you'd have to get a taxi probably
A	the bus's good value
B	yeah
A	one pound for the whole day
D	yeah
B	is it just a little mini bus?
A	circular
D	it was a little circular mini bus
B	is it all above board or is it just a fellow on a bus?
